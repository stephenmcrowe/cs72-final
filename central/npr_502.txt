             A medical professional administers a coronavirus test at a drive-thru testing site run by George Washington University Hospital, on May 26, 2020 in Washington, D.C. In April, New Orleans health officials realized their drive-through testing strategy for the coronavirus wasn't working. The reason? Census tract data  revealed hot spots for the virus were located in predominantly low-income African-American neighborhoods where many residents lacked cars. In response, officials have changed their strategy, sending mobile testing vans to some of those areas, says Thomas LaVeist, dean of Tulane University's School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine and co-chair of Louisiana's COVID-19 Health Equity Task Force. "Data is the only way that we can see the virus," LaVeist says. "We only have indicators. We can't actually look at a person and tell who's been infected. So what we have is data right now." Until a few weeks ago, racial data for COVID-19 was sparse. It's still incomplete, but now 48 states plus Washington D.C., report at least some data; in total, race or ethnicity is known for around half of all cases and 90% of deaths. And though gaps remain, the pattern is clear: Communities of color are being hit disproportionately hard by COVID-19.  Public health experts say focusing on these disparities is crucial for helping communities respond to the virus effectively — so everyone is safer.  "I think it's incumbent on all of us to realize that the health of all of us depends on the health of each of us," says Dr. Alicia Fernandez, a professor of medicine at the University of California San Francisco, whose research focuses on health care disparities. NPR analyzed COVID-19 demographic data collected by the COVID Racial Tracker, a joint project of the Antiracist Research & Policy Center and the COVID Tracking Project. This analysis compares each racial or ethnic group's share of infections or deaths — where race and ethnicity is known — with their share of population. Here's what it shows:  Major holes in the data remain: 48% of cases and 9% of deaths still have no race tied to them. And that can hamper response to the crisis across the U.S., now and in the future, says Dr. Utibe Essien, a health equity researcher at the University of Pittsburgh who has studied COVID-19 racial and ethnic disparities. "If we don't know who is sick, we're not going to know in six months, 12 months, 18, however long it takes, who should be getting the vaccination. We're not going to know where we should be directing our personal protective equipment to make sure that health care workers are protected," he says.  A heavy toll of African-American deaths NPR's analysis finds that in 32 states plus Washington D.C., blacks are dying at rates higher than their proportion of the population. In 21 states, it's substantially higher, more than 50% above what would be expected. For example, in Wisconsin,  at least 141 African Americans have died, representing 27% of all deaths in a state where just 6% of the state's population is black.  Loading...  "I've been at health equity research for a couple of decades now. Those of us in the field, sadly, expected this," says Dr. Marcella Nunez-Smith, director of the Equity Research and Innovation Center at Yale School of Medicine. "We know that these racial ethnic disparities in COVID-19 are the result of pre-pandemic realities. It's a legacy of structural discrimination that has limited access to health and wealth for people of color," she says. African-Americans have higher rates of underlying conditions, including diabetes, heart disease, and lung disease, that are linked to more severe cases of COVID-19, Nunez-Smith notes. They also often have less access to quality health care, and are disproportionately represented in essential frontline jobs that can't be done from home, increasing their exposure to the virus.  Data from a recently published paper in the Annals of Epidemiology reinforces the finding that African-Americans are harder hit in this pandemic. The study from researchers at amfAR, the Foundation for AIDS Research, looks at county-level health outcomes, comparing counties with disproportionately black populations to all other counties.  Their analysis shows that while disproportionately black counties account for only 30% of the U.S. population, they were the location of 56% of COVID-19 deaths. And even disproportionately black counties with above-average wealth and health care coverage bore an unequal share of deaths.  "There's a structural issue that's taking place here, it's not a genetic issue for all non-white individuals in the U.S.," says Greg Millett, director of public policy at amfAR and lead researcher on the paper.  Hispanics bear a disproportionate share of infections Latinos and Hispanics test positive for the coronavirus at rates higher than would be expected for their share of the population in all but one of the 44 jurisdictions that report Hispanic ethnicity data (42 states plus Washington D.C.). The rates are two times higher in 30 states, and over four times higher in eight states. For example, in Virginia more than 12,000 cases — 49% of all cases with known ethnicity — come from the Hispanic and Latino community, which makes up only 10% of the population.   Loading...  Fernandez has seen these disparities first-hand as an internist at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital. While Latinos made up about 35% of patients there before the pandemic, she says they now make up over 80% of COVID-19 cases at the hospital. "In the early stages, when we were noticing increased Latino hospitalization at our own hospital and we felt that no one was paying attention and that people were just happy that San Francisco was crushing the curve, it felt horrendous," she says. "It felt as if people were dismissing those lives. ... It took people longer to realize what was going on."

             People get free COVID-19 tests without needing to show ID, doctor's note or symptoms at a drive-through and walk up Coronavirus testing center located in Arlington, Va., on May 26th. Like African-Americans, Latinos are over-represented in essential jobs that increase their exposure to the virus, says Fernandez. Regardless of their occupation, high rates of poverty and low wages mean that many Latinos feel compelled to leave home to seek work. Dense, multi-generational housing conditions make it easier for the virus to spread, she says. The disproportionate share of deaths isn't as stark for Latinos as it is for African-Americans. Fernandez says that's likely because the U.S. Latino population overall is younger — nearly three-quarters are millennials or younger, according to data from the Pew Research Center. But in California, "when you look at it by age groups, [older] Latinos are just as likely to die as African-Americans," she says. Other racial groups While data for smaller minority populations is harder to come by, where it exists, it also shows glaring disparities. In New Mexico, Native American communities have accounted for 60% of cases but only 9% of the population. Similarly, in Arizona, at least 136 Native American have died from COVID-19, a striking 21% of deaths in a state where just 4% of the population are Native American.  In several states Asian Americans have seen a disproportionate share of cases. In South Dakota, for example, they account for only 2% of the population but 12% of cases. But beyond these places, data can be spotty. In Iowa, Maine, Michigan, Oklahoma and Wisconsin, Asian Americans and Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders are counted together, making comparison to census data difficult.  Fernandez points out that if COVID-19 demographic reporting included language, public health officials might see differences among different Asian groups, such as Vietnamese or Filipino Americans. "That's what's going to allow public health officials to really target different communities," she says. "We need that kind of information." Understanding the unknowns Months into the pandemic, painting a national picture of how minorities are being affected remains a fraught proposition, because in many states, large gaps remain in the data. For instance, in New York state — until recently the epicenter of the the U.S outbreak — race and ethnicity data are available for deaths but not for cases. In Texas, which has a large minority population and a sizable outbreak, less than 25% of cases and deaths have race or ethnicity data associated with them.   Loading...  There are also still concerns about how some states are collecting data, says Christopher Petrella, director of engagement for the Antiracist Research and Policy Center at American University. For example, he says West Virginia — which claims to have race data for 100% of positive cases and 82% of deaths — only reports three categories: white, black and "other."  Also, some states appear to be listing Hispanics under the white category, says Samantha Artiga, director of the Disparities Policy Project at Kaiser Family Foundation. "There's a lot of variation across states in terms of how they report the data that makes comparing the data across states hard, as well as getting a full national picture," Artiga says. But experts fear that the available data actually undercounts the disparity observed in communities of color.  "I think we have the undercount anyway, because we know that minority communities are less likely to be tested for COVID-19," says Millett. NPR's own analysis found that in four out of six cities in Texas, testing sites were disproportionately located in whiter communities. Millet points to a recent study, released pre-peer review, that found that when testing levels went up in disadvantaged neighborhoods in Philadelphia, Chicago and New York City, so too did the evidence of the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on these communities.

Churches in low income communities across New York are offering COVID-19 testing to residents. Lawmakers have raised concern about the way the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports racial and ethnic data; the agency didn't report on demographics early on in the crisis, and even now it updates it weekly but with a one- to two-week lag. Democratic senators Patty Murray of Washington and Democratic Rep. Frank Pallone, Jr., of New Jersey called a recent report on demographics the CDC submitted to Congress "woefully inadequate."   "The U.S. response to COVID-19 has been plagued by insufficient data on the impact of the virus, as well as the federal government's response to it," Murray and Pallone wrote in a letter sent May 22 to Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar. They called on the Trump administration to provide more comprehensive demographic data. A tailored public health response Essien says he's heard concerns from colleagues that by focusing on race and ethnicity in the disease, "some of the empathy for managing and treating is going to go away." "If people feel like, 'Well, this is a them problem and not a me problem ... then that may potentially affect the way that people think about the opening up of the country," he says. But unless testing and other resources are directed now to communities that need them most, the pandemic will go on for everyone, says Nunez-Smith. "This is important for everyone's health and safety," she says. Nunez-Smith says race and ethnicity data is necessary for officials to craft tailored public health responses.  "For many people, physical distancing is a privilege," she says. "If you live in a crowded neighborhood or you share a household with many other people, we need to give messaging specific to those conditions. If you need to leave home for work every day, if you need to take public transportation to get to an essential frontline job, how can you keep safe?"  A tailored public health response is already happening in Louisiana, where LaVeist says his task force has recently recruited celebrities like Big Freedia, a pioneer of the New Orleans hip-hop subgenre called bounce, to counter misinformation and spread public health messages about COVID-19 to the African-American community.  Given the pandemic's disparate toll on communities of color, in particular low-income ones, Fernandez and Nunez-Smith say the public health response should include helping to meet basic needs like providing food, wage supports and even temporary housing for people who get sick or exposed to the virus. "We have to guarantee that if we recommend to someone that they should be in quarantine or they should be in isolation, that they can do so safely and effectively," Nunez-Smith says.  Nunez-Smith says if you don't direct resources now to minority communities that need them most, there's a danger they might be less likely to trust and buy into public health messaging needed to stem the pandemic. Already, polls show widespread distrust of President Trump among African-Americans, and that a majority of them believe the Trump administration's push to reopen states came only after it became clear that people of color were bearing the brunt of the pandemic.  Fernandez notes that among Latinos, distrust could also hamper efforts to conduct effective contact tracing, because people who are undocumented or in mixed-status families may be reluctant to disclose who they've been in contact with.  "This is a terrible time for all of us who do health equity work," says Fernandez, "partly because this is so predictable and partly because we're standing here waving our arms saying, 'Wait, wait. We need help.' " Connie Hanzhang Jin, Alice Goldfarb and Selena Simmons-Duffin contributed to this report.

             Traditional Diné medicine practitioner Jeneda Benally, pictured here with her daughter Dahi, is trying to preserve cultural wisdom in danger of being lost during the pandemic. In Navajo culture to speak of death is taboo. But since the tribe's coronavirus infection rate has become the highest in the country, they can't help but talk about it. "It's killing every day," says medicine man Ty Davis, who knows at least five traditional practitioners who have died from COVID-19. "It put me into shock," he says. "What do we do now? How do we retrieve that knowledge that these elders once knew now that they have died with those ceremonies? How do we get those back?" Each medicine person specializes in different ceremonies. So when someone dies they take that knowledge with them. Over the last several decades the tribe has gone from a thousand Diné or Navajo medicine people to just 300. The coronavirus threatens the few who remain. Medicine man Avery Denny is attempting to change that trajectory by taking on apprentices where he teaches at Diné College on the Navajo Nation. Professor Avery Denny sings the the Journey Song to college graduates.  "I have great great concerns," Denny says. Denny says he's up against centuries of colonialism when it comes to preserving Navajo culture and tradition. The federal government forced tribes to relocate, sent Native children to boarding schools where they were beaten for speaking their language for singing their songs. "Young people are acculturated, assimilated, dominated. They're losing their language and their culture," Denny says. Denny says white missionaries are also to blame for replacing Navajo religion. "Christianity is the belief that our people turned to even our leadership so there's no guidance," Denny says. "There's no leader that says, 'OK we'll turn to Navajo values and Navajo Diné medicine.'" For instance, the Navajo president begins each meeting with a Christian prayer even though he also addresses his community in Navajo. The loss of traditional practitioners is not just a cultural loss but also a personal one for people such as Jeneda Benally, whose aunt recently died from COVID-19. "I am really emotional about this because it's so painful to lose so many loved ones," she says. Benally is a traditional practitioner who works alongside her father who was the first medicine man to practice in a Western hospital. "I felt very early on during this pandemic that I needed to protect my father so that way he can continue to help people in order to protect our future generations," Benally says. One way she is doing that is working with her brother Clayson to produce youtube videos to share Navajo cultural practices like how to dry farm and how to shear sheep. The Benallys hope their videos will encourage tribal members to reconnect with their culture, especially now while tribal members are spending a lot of time at home during during the coronavirus pandemic. "We've got this technology," Jeneda Benally says. "How are we going to find hope in this technology? How are we going to find the continuation of our culture where we can connect our elders to our youth?" The dilemma is figuring out what parts of Navajo culture they can share publicly and what parts are too sacred and can only be passed down from one Navajo to another.This page is updated regularly.   Loading...  Since the first coronavirus case was confirmed in the United States on Jan. 21, more than 1 million people in the U.S. have confirmed cases of COVID-19. On April 12, the U.S. became the nation with the most deaths globally, but there are early signs that the U.S. case and death counts may be leveling off, as the growth of new cases and deaths plateaus. The pattern isn't consistent across the country, as new hot spots emerge and others subside. To see how quickly your state's case count is growing, click here.  Loading...  Click here to see a global map of confirmed cases and deaths. In response to mounting cases, state and federal authorities have emphasized a social distancing strategy, widely seen as the best available means to slow the spread of the virus. Most states have put in place measures such as closing schools and nonessential businesses and ordering citizens to stay home as much as possible.  It's not clear how long such measures need to be in place to see a lasting effect. In Wuhan, the city in China where the virus originated, a strictly enforced lockdown and widespread testing have slowed the outbreak dramatically, enough to bring an end to the 76-day lockdown. A large portion of U.S. cases are centered on New York City. Since March 20, New York state, Connecticut and New Jersey have accounted for about 50% of all U.S. cases. As of April 9, nearly 60% of all deaths from COVID-19 have been in these three states. While New York state appears to be reaching a plateau, as seen below, it notched between 8,000 and 10,000 new cases each day between March 31 and April 12.  To understand how one state's outbreak compares with another's, it's helpful to look at not just the daily counts but the rate of change day over day. In the following chart, we display cases on a logarithmic scale, meaning that every axis line is 10 times greater than the previous one. This type of scale emphasizes the rate of change.   When case counts grow very quickly, a state's curve trends sharply upward, as New York's does over the first 15 days past 100 cases. Generally, this is evidence of unbridled community transmission of the disease. As new cases slow, the curve bends toward horizontal, showing that the state's outbreak may be leveling off. This doesn't mean the number of cases has stopped growing, but the rate of growth has slowed, which could signify that social distancing measures are having an effect.   Loading...  In some areas, there are signs of hope. The areas with the earliest outbreaks — such as California and Washington — seem to be having success at suppressing the disease. The outlook in Washington has improved to the point that the state has returned unused Army hospital beds it had received in preparation for a peak in cases.  Elsewhere, limited access to testing may make the number of cases look smaller than it really is. As testing becomes more readily available, we are likely to see the number of confirmed cases continue to grow, even if not at the pace previously seen.   Loading...

                This weekend, temporary pay bumps for workers during the coronavirus pandemic are ending at companies across the country. In a normal world, high hazard pay might be the only way to stop employees from quitting en masse. But with tens of millions unemployed, workers quickly lost a lot of leverage.

             This weekend, temporary pay bumps for workers during the coronavirus pandemic are ending at companies across the country. In a normal world, high hazard pay might be the only way to stop employees from quitting en masse. But with tens of millions unemployed, workers quickly lost a lot of leverage. Hero pay. Thank You pay. Service pay. Hazard pay.  These were the many names for temporary pay bumps that some stores, warehouses and factories gave to workers who risked their health to continue to show up on the job during the pandemic. It's hard to say that an extra $3 an hour made a dramatic difference in Sammy Сonde's budget. Maybe a few more groceries — soup is a dinner favorite — or an occasional treat of a takeout meal after a particularly tiring workday. Conde is a Starbucks barista in Orlando, an essential worker keeping locals caffeinated via drive-through windows and curbside pickup. Like many corporations that asked employees to work in a health crisis, Starbucks added new safety measures and perks — like new health and leave options, and a big one: a temporary pay bump of $3 an hour. That bumped Conde's hourly wage to $13. But the raise goes away this weekend. "It feels like Starbucks could've been paying me this the whole time, and they're just choosing to do it now to help me feel better, but it's not really paying what I need," says Conde, who's part of a worker advocacy group Fight for $15, which argues, alongside other labor activists, that temporary pandemic raises should be permanent. This weekend, such temporary pay bumps are ending at companies including Amazon and Molson Coors. They already ended at Rite Aid and Kroger. Some companies, like Walmart and CVS, paid one-time bonuses instead. Some had no hazard pay altogether. Target and Kraft Heinz told NPR they're extending their temporary extra pay a bit longer.  Meanwhile, particularly at stores, new hazards arise, as workers who signed up to stock shelves and run registers take on new roles as enforcers of social distancing and mask wearing. For many, their pay — for being essential, with hazard pay — is lower than what the federal government is paying in unemployment relief. "Last week I think there were three days I just woke up crying because I just can't do this anymore, I'm exhausted," says Christine Smith, a cashier and union shop steward at a Ralphs supermarket in California, part of Kroger. "And people are ... yelling at us, cussing at us — because we won't do returns, because we're asking them to wear a mask, because we're telling them they can't use their reusable bags."  Altercations with shoppers are cropping up across the country, captured in a new genre of viral videos. Some incidents have turned violent and even deadly. McDonald's workers were shot at in Oklahoma. A Family Dollar security guard was killed in Michigan. In a normal world, high hazard pay might be the only way to stop employees from quitting en masse. But with tens of millions unemployed, workers quickly lost a lot of leverage. 
                Ralphs supermarket cashier Christine Smith finds herself flinching every time someone buys cough medicine. "The company executives, they have their nice offices or they can work from home," she says. "We don't have that option. ... And without us, they wouldn't have a company."

             Ralphs supermarket cashier Christine Smith finds herself flinching every time someone buys cough medicine. "The company executives, they have their nice offices or they can work from home," she says. "We don't have that option. ... And without us, they wouldn't have a company." In statements, companies employing non-medical frontline workers underscore how much they value their staff, saying the workers' health and safety come first and foremost. Most of the companies have invested heavily in more cleanings, protective gear including masks, temperature screenings and other safety measures. Beyond that, Starbucks and Molson Coors have pointed out extended leave options past May, while Amazon also highlighted its starting pay minimum of $15. Kroger says it will award another one-time bonus to all workers in coming days. Kraft Heinz will keep "evaluating" its special stipend of $100 a week for manufacturing workers. Target has extended its $2 hazard pay until July 4.   "As we navigate the way forward, you have my word that we will continue to do what's right for you and your families, so you feel supported every step of the way," Starbucks executive Rossann Williams wrote in a letter to staff on April 16. Extra pay and benefits are expensive, costing large employers hundreds of millions of dollars during the pandemic.  But a purely economic analysis of coronavirus risks that frontline workers face suggests that hazard pay bumps should be 10 times bigger than a few dollars an hour, closer to $10 or $20 more an hour, according to calculations by Columbia University economist Suresh Naidu.  One impact companies might see long-term is fewer takers for low-paying essential jobs. This week, hiring platform Indeed reported rapidly dropping interest in such jobs in May from a big spike in February. An economist for the site wrote that pay is part of it: The median hourly wage has risen almost 2% during the crisis, but gains mostly went to higher-income workers.  Katharine Thomas has been getting $2 more an hour for working the cash register at a small food co-op in Wisconsin. But she expects that to end as shoppers' demand slows down to normal and so does her company's income. "I want to stress how grateful I am because my company did not have to do that, but I don't think $2 an hour is — hero pay?" she says and sighs, pondering out loud about what kind of heroic work could ever be worth $2 extra.  
                Grocery cashier Katharine Thomas wishes the federal government helped essential workers as much as it's helping the unemployed with relief of $600 a week. "Even with hazard pay, I still don't make that much money," she says.

             Grocery cashier Katharine Thomas wishes the federal government helped essential workers as much as it's helping the unemployed with relief of $600 a week. "Even with hazard pay, I still don't make that much money," she says. Thomas remembers seeing people around her losing jobs and getting not just unemployment but extra federal relief of $600 a week.  "I felt very angry," she says. "I have to go to work. And I make less money, being essential. Six hundred dollars a week — that's almost the whole paycheck for me. Even with hazard pay, I still don't make that much money." This month, the House of Representatives included $200 billion in pandemic hazard pay for essential workers in a latest coronavirus relief bill. But it passed largely along party lines with a Democrat majority, and Republicans in the Senate are taking on their version of the relief package. And so the fate of the legislation remains uncertain. "My hope is that the federal government, they're doing so much for unemployed people ... maybe help us, people who are still working, will you?" Thomas says. "I'm a working person. I work full time. I make not enough money to live on. I think anyone who's working full-time should be able to afford a decent life." Editor's note: Amazon, Starbucks, Target and Walmart are among NPR's financial supporters.I need to take a trip that would be either a few hours flying or multiple days driving. Which is safer? As lockdown orders are relaxed to some capacity in countries around the world, travel is starting to see an uptick for the first time since mid-March. But when it comes to taking a longer trip, is it better to travel by car or by plane? Dr. Henry Wu, a professor of infectious disease medicine at Emory University and director of its TravelWell Center, says there is no definite answer — but it all comes down to planning ahead.  Regardless of whether you fly or drive, Wu says that the first thing to keep in mind is that until a vaccine is developed and proven effective, it's impossible to fully mitigate all the coronavirus risks, including those associated with traveling.  That means that in accordance with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's guidance, travel should still be limited to circumstances in which it's absolutely necessary. And for people who are immunocompromised or at high risk of developing severe illnesses, it should be avoided as much as possible.  If you feel you need to take a trip, one main benefit of driving is that it gives you a greater sense of control over your surroundings — although that doesn't mean it's necessarily safer than flying. Lawrence Gostin, director of the O'Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law at Georgetown University, says the key to staying safe is taking measures like wearing a mask and carrying hand sanitizer when in public spaces. He worries, from a behavioral point of view, that people are less likely to follow hygiene protocols over the course of several stops on a long drive.   Here are some essential steps Wu and Gostin suggest to prepare for a road trip: However, both Wu and Gostin point out that there are certain unavoidable risks that come with driving — like the chances of getting in an accident or having car trouble. And you should always consider your own comfort level with long road trips and unknown highways.  If I decide to take an overnight road trip, how should I choose my lodging? Gostin says the safest option would be camping — sleeping in your car or on camping grounds with your own tent and supplies. That eliminates the risks of staying in an indoor space where you could come into contact with others. If camping isn't an option, there are other steps to lower the risks of an overnight stay. Wu and Gostin recommend choosing a hotel or motel option without elevators or other confined spaces — like a crowded breakfast buffet — that could force you to come in close contact with employees and other guests. "The more people, the smaller the space, the less [air] circulation and the longer you're there, your risk goes up," says Gostin. Ask ahead of time that the hotel or Airbnb is using EPA-approved disinfectants to clean all surfaces in the room between guests, and, if possible, try to request rooms that have been unoccupied for several days — although there's no way to know for sure that you're getting an honest answer.  "We know that COVID-19 virus viability on environmental surfaces is limited, and it really depends on the type of surface, the temperature and the humidity. But in most situations, [the virus] is not viable after several days," says Wu. "So if you have a room that's been empty for four or five days or even more, [that's] better."  It's also a good idea to bring your own alcohol wipes for the road and, once inside the room, to wipe down areas that could have been touched by prior occupants: door knobs, tabletops and the TV remote. Or just avoid touching these whenever you can.  Gostin also suggests staying in your room as much as possible. If you have a room with windows that can open, wipe them down before opening them to let in fresh air.  What if I'd rather travel by plane? If driving for several days seems daunting, taking a flight might be preferable.  "Air circulation systems on planes are quite good. They have high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters and high rates of air exchange," says Wu. "But that still doesn't protect you from what is happening immediately around you." One of the biggest risks of flying is that it's hard to predict how full a flight might be or how much you'll be able to socially distance from other passengers and employees, even as airlines make efforts to minimize close contact. Read more about the risks of flying — and safety precautions you can take — here.  Could I take a bus or train instead? Like airplanes, buses and trains both mean traveling in an enclosed environment. One of Wu's main concerns is the type of air filters used, which may vary from vehicle to vehicle. It might not be possible to find out what type of filter is used in the particular bus or train you are riding or whether it's effectively circulating the air.  Additionally, not all bus and train companies might be able to exert as much environmental controls as airlines in terms of  requiring empty seats between passengers and notifying you if your vehicle is expected to be at full capacity. Greyhound currently requires all passengers and employees —  except children under two and people with breathing difficulties — to wear masks on buses. In addition to requiring face covering, Amtrak is limiting seat capacity to 50% on each train. All café seating is closed.  The same prevention tactics apply to train or bus travel as flying — wash hands often, wipe down surfaces before you touch them and avoid removing your mask.  And when deciding between a train or plane ride, keep in mind the matter of time spent in potentially crowded travel situations matters. "I would pick whatever's shortest," says Wu.  I live in an apartment building. Could I get the coronavirus through the air conditioning system? We know that the coronavirus is primarily transmitted through respiratory droplets — if an infected person coughs, sneezes or talks near other people, they expel droplets that could get someone else sick.  Could the droplets travel through the air-handling system in an apartment or condo building and into another unit, potentially infecting the neighbors?  There is still no definite answer. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention says that "the contribution of small respirable particles, sometimes called aerosols or droplet nuclei, to close proximity transmission is currently uncertain. However, airborne transmission from person-to-person over long distances is unlikely." That's not to dismiss the risks of aerosol transmission. One study focused on a case in Guangzhou, China, in which three families contracted COVID-19 from eating in the same restaurant. This infection has been primarily attributed to poor ventilation within that particular restaurant.  But Dr. Abraar Karan, physician at Harvard Medical School, says the chances of getting sick from particles being spread from one room to another through the air conditioning system seems unlikely. William Bahnfleth, engineering professor at Penn State University and chair of the Epidemic Task Force for American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers, says it does not seem likely that you could get sick from the AC in your building.  "If they're small enough, [viral particles] can move through the air. They can move from place to place in a building, either through the air conditioning system or just on air currents under the influence of pressure differences in the building," he says. "But the real important question is, is there enough of that happening that anyone gets an infection from that? And so far, there doesn't seem to be evidence that that has happened."  Dr. Emily Landon, hospital epidemiologist and infectious diseases specialist at University of Chicago Medicine, agrees. She points to places like Hong Kong, Singapore and South Korea, where many people live in high-rises, and there have been no documented reports of infection due to air conditioning between apartments. What's more, if you live in a building with what's called "once-through ventilation air supply," then the air comes in from the outside, is cooled or heated — and does not "intentionally circulate air between units," Bahnfleth says. If you're still concerned about airflow in your apartment, Bahnfleth suggests opening your windows if possible to bring in fresh air, although this might not be the best option in a high-rise. And although an air purifier or cleaner cannot fully protect you from COVID-19, the Environmental Protection Agency says having one in your home can be a part of your prevention strategy.  "When used along with other best practices recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, operating an air cleaner can be part of a plan to protect yourself and your family," the agency said in a statement.  As we learn more about the virus, it's possible that the guidance related to air conditioning systems will change. But for now, Landon says it's not a primary concern for the spread of COVID-19. "The preponderance of the evidence suggests that [getting infected through air conditioning systems] should not be a problem, but it's a new virus," says Landon.  "We don't know everything that there is to know."

             Dr. Jonas E. Salk, who discovered the polio vaccine, reads with his wife and three boys in Ann Arbor, Mich., on April 11, 1955. The boys were among the first vaccinated during testing. The family was photographed the night before an announcement the vaccine was effective. Pictured from left are Jonathan, 5; Donna Salk; Peter, 11; Salk; and Darrell, 8. When Dr. Jonas Salk first began testing his potential polio vaccine in 1953, he brought it home from his nearby lab at the University of Pittsburgh. "I just hated injections," recalled his son Peter Salk, 76, and the oldest of three brothers. "So my father came home with polio vaccine and some syringes and needles that he sterilized on the kitchen stove, boiling them in water, and lined us kids up and then administered the vaccine." Peter Salk, then 9, wasn't old enough to understand fully why he and his brothers were getting this injection. Yet he remembers that shot like no other. "Somehow the needle must have missed a nerve, and I didn't feel it. And so that has fixed that moment in my mind," he said. As the world awaits a vaccine for COVID-19, Salk recalled an era when polio terrorized the country every summer. Kids were hit hardest. In the worst single year, 1952, nearly 60,000 children were infected. Many were paralyzed, and more than 3,000 died. Frightened parents kept their children away from swimming pools, movie theaters and other public places. When Salk and his brothers were injected, it marked the beginning of the end of polio. But it was a protracted process. What followed was the largest human trial ever, with nearly 2 million American children taking part. Finally, on April 12, 1955, nearly two years after the Salk boys had received their shots, the vaccine was declared "safe, effective and potent." "What happened in the country at that moment was remarkable. There was jubilation," Salk said. "There was such a sense of relief that this fear, which had been hanging over everyone's heads for years and years and years, was finally lifted." It's one of the great vaccine success stories, and Jonas Salk became one of the most celebrated men in America. Polio was effectively wiped out in the U.S. by the early 1960s. Since then, it's been steadily eliminated around the world. These days, only a small number of cases crop up annually, mostly in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Nigeria.

A word of warning Peter Salk, who lives in La Jolla, Calif., is also a doctor and a part-time professor of infectious diseases at the University of Pittsburgh, and he heads the Jonas Salk Legacy Foundation. To stay safe, he continues to hang out at home with his wife, Ellen, even as government restrictions ease and shops and restaurants in the area begin to reopen. Given the long family experience in this field, Peter Salk said he is optimistic about a COVID-19 vaccine. But he cautioned about racing ahead before one is fully tested. "I congratulate the impulse on the part of the federal government right now to want to speed things up as much as possible," he said. "What concerns me is knowing that in the past there have been unexpected things that have taken place with vaccines that had not been foreseen." His father, who died in 1995, worked on his vaccine for seven years before it was approved. His research was funded by charitable donations, and he didn't seek a patent. When journalist Edward R. Murrow asked Jonas Salk who owned the patent, the doctor replied: "The people, I would say. There is no patent. Could you patent the sun?" Then, as now, the need to vaccinate was urgent. But there were delays, Peter Salk noted. "The vaccine was introduced, but haltingly. It wasn't done the way my father would have liked to have seen — 'Let's just get this out and get it into every single child's arm,' " Salk said. At one point, a government health official was called before a Senate committee and asked why it was taking so long. Peter Salk picked up a book and cited a passage about the episode:  "As to her failure to anticipate the need for adequate supplies of vaccine earlier than she did, she replied heatedly, 'I think no one could have foreseen the public demand.' " Peter Salk said it took roughly a decade for the polio vaccine to be researched, tested and widely distributed to the American public. He said he hopes it will happen much faster this time.

             Margaret Sullivan looks out the windows of Goodwin House in Falls Church, Va. At 85, Margaret Sullivan felt that she had a comfortable life and was being well taken care of in a retirement home in Northern Virginia. "Living in a bubble," she said. But then she shared a piece of sad news: "My brother died about two weeks ago of the virus." He lived a few states away. "I'm the oldest and he's the youngest," she explained. "And that's outside the order of things."  For many, the pandemic has been long days of juggling kids and work. Worrying about money. Trying to schedule grocery deliveries. But for Sullivan, the virus brings with it thoughts of mortality. The octogenerian lives at Goodwin House in Bailey's Crossroads, Va., and has been documenting all the ways the coronavirus pandemic has shut down life around her. The first glimpse of things to come was on Feb. 28. "Overnight, the Purell bottles stationed everywhere grew signs, 'Don't take me home. I'm for everyone,'" she recalled.

             A few days later, salt and pepper shakers disappeared from dining rooms, "in an abundance of caution." On March 12, the "lockdown" as she calls it, began. Residents were not to leave, and no outsiders could come in — which meant, no more visits from her daughter, who lives five miles away. "We are being extraordinarily well taken care of, but we are also being carefully harbored," Sullivan said during a phone call on April 2. As many as 1 in 4 people age 85 and older who are infected with the virus die, according to early research. "We are vulnerable," Sullivan said in April. "I think the youngest of us is in their late 60s. And the oldest of us — there are 500 or so of us — is 100 and something." She and her husband had recently updated their will, fixing married names of their children.  "You need to be sure that the documents that the kids would need to have are in order," she said, a few minutes before ending the call. "And so we're going downstairs to find the notary." "This is something I've seen" Sullivan describes herself as a rolling stone. She was born in China, and her father was a doctor of public health in parasitology. When the rumblings of World War II began, 6-year-old Sullivan moved back to the U.S. with her family. Later, when she was in high school, the family moved to Burma (now Myanmar), then India, where she graduated from high school. She ended up in Washington, D.C., for college. And then she got married. "'We joined the Foreign Service — he was the only one who got paid," she said with a laugh. "So we've lived around the equator and raised kids around the equator." Sullivan says this life, hopping from country-to-country in Asia and Africa with four kids in tow, put her in the path of a number of epidemics. In the 1970s, the family was living in Sierra Leone while the Lassa Fever was raging there. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention sent a team to collect blood samples of sick people — and those infected samples were stored in Sullivan's refrigerator. "Until the next plane came through and they went back to Atlanta," she said. Then there was the time they were living in Nigeria: "All three of the kids got mumps the day I was supposed to host a big party. I mean, everybody has these stories." A long life, much of it lived abroad, gives Sullivan perspective on the current pandemic, of both perspective of time, and geography. "There is a sense in which this is new and startling and different, and much more concerning. But there's another sense in which this is something I've seen in a different way. I don't know whether it makes me more comfortable or less comfortable." "Life turned on its head" Sullivan is a writer, and has written books about her globetrotting life. Now, she's writing about — and recording — her life under lockdown. "Life sort of turned on its head here late Wednesday afternoon," begins a recording from April 11. A letter had arrived, outlining new social distancing restrictions.

             Left: Margaret's husband, Dan, with a takeaway meal on April 6. Right: The masked couple inspecting menus on April 21; meals must be ordered two days in advance, and are now delivered to each resident, to limit contact. Weeks earlier, the dining rooms at Goodwin House had converted to takeaway service only, with residents waiting 6 feet apart to pick up food. Now, the letter said, meals would be delivered and left outside each resident's door. In the recording, there's a knock. "And there comes my lunch. Just a minute," Sullivan said, putting down the recorder with a clunk. She catches up with the staff member who delivered the meal. "Well, it's more fun when we can go downstairs and pick it up and chat with you." In another recording, she's interrupted by her husband, Dan. "You came back to get your mask? OK. Here it is," she said, as he puttered in the background. "Dan, it needs to go over your nose." The Sullivans have been married for 65 years. He's 91, and has mid-stage Alzheimer's. As the patterns of daily life change during the pandemic, Dan's confusion increases. There are many more conversations about where everyday objects are than there were just a few weeks ago. "He's good about picking up and taking things to the sink," Sullivan said. "I may have to remind him that the sink is where the sink is." "There's a bog and I'm caught in it" Sullivan jokes about the situation, and she keeps busy — scheduling Zoom calls with her kids and grandkids. But lately, there's a sense of gravity settling in. "I find myself very seriously feeling hollow. It just sort of — there's a bog and I'm caught in it," she says in a recording from April 18. There's also the day — April 8 — when Sullivan ends her recording this way: "Today's my brother's birthday, and he isn't here for me to call. And so my heart breaks a bit on that, too."

             "Zooming on Sunday night with number one son, Jerry (who is a professor of anthropology at Collin Collage in Texas) and his wife Phillipa who live in McKenney, Texas," writes Margaret. "We are talking with each of our four kids (adult children) this way. And having drinks with friends sometimes." She reads the news each morning — the papers are being delivered by a cadre of volunteers in the building — and struggles to find the right word, as nursing homes around the country are overtaken by deaths from COVID-19. "I won't say that life is terrifying," she said. "I haven't quite found the right word for what it is. But it certainly is concerning." Now that she and Dan have updated their will, they're working on a living will. "I had never thought that I would want to write down 'Do not ventilate,'" Sullivan said. "There are other people who need them more, and I have had a good life. And so I think that's what we'll do." One of 100,000 In late April, the retirement home where Sullivan lives had its first confirmed case of the coronavirus. All the residents had to get tested. "The swab goes up your nose. It doesn't hurt very much," Sullivan said. "Everybody sort of held their breath a bit 'til you get the results." Sullivan says nine people tested positive, and two of them died. It made her very aware, she said, of the world of risk she lives in. Then, last weekend, the Sunday New York Times came — the edition marking 100,000 deaths in the United States. The front page is nothing but names of the dead — six columns in small print. "We brought it in and as we always do, there was coffee and the paper," she said. "I knew he had to be there." She found her brother's name halfway down the first column. Like each name, it was followed by a tiny obituary — a whole life condensed into four words. "For Ted, they said that he 'could make anything grow.' And he could," Sullivan said. She wasn't able to be with her brother when he died and has no idea if or when the family will be able to get together to cry, and tell stories about him. Instead it's all online. Sullivan folded the newspaper, circled Ted's name in red ink, took a photo, and posted it on Facebook.Over the past few weeks, our TVs have become a time machine. They've transported us to our past, to scenes of crowded subway cars and chaotic playgrounds. Where faces are unmasked and people sit shoulder-to-shoulder. I've found myself marveling at movies where carefree characters hang out at sporting venues and music clubs. It makes me remember a time when I didn't have to think twice about hugging a friend, or stopping by a café with a colleague. It's hard to imagine being quite so carefree again, even as many communities in the U.S. and across the globe make tentative steps to reopen. The ache we feel for a world before COVID-19 may seem unproductive. What's the value in looking back at lost freedoms and comforts? Why focus on things we cannot change? Of course, this is how the mind works. As World War II was coming to a close, researchers in Minnesota put volunteers on a starvation diet as part of a research experiment on how to help starving people in war-torn areas. As the volunteers got hungrier and hungrier, their minds became consumed by food.  Some time ago, I was chatting with Clay Routledge, a psychologist at North Dakota State University, for an episode that we did called "The Good Old Days." Clay studies nostalgia, and how it affects the way we think about our lives. Many of us experience nostalgia as a bittersweet emotion. It combines the memory of good times with the ache of loss. You might think that people who are more nostalgic are more prone to sadness and depression. But Clay found that nostalgic reflection makes us more optimistic. It reaffirms our social connections. And by remembering important things about the past, it lays out a vision for a hopeful future.  I've found in recent weeks that my own mind is going back further and further, sometimes to my distant childhood. Last week, I cooked a recipe I learned decades ago from a long-dead aunt. I remembered how – after placing food before me – she always thought to place some food on her windowsill for birds to eat. When we remember people who have been kind to us, when we remember happy times, we are not merely engaging in fantasy. We're reminding ourselves of our place in the world. Nostalgia gives us renewed appreciation for the people and places that constitute our lives.  A number of years ago, Clay surveyed a group of British adults who had been children during World War II. The war was a time of great upheaval for them, as their country was bombed and family members were sent off to the battlefront. But these people didn't remember the period with horror. They remembered it with nostalgia. They told Clay that it as a time of deep distress  — but also a time of profound meaning. It revealed what was truly important: their connections to other people. "There was so much movement, so much upheaval," one person told Clay. "Yet through it all there is a strong sense of belonging, of security, of family."   Perhaps you understand this yourself. One thing many of us have realized these past few months is how much we value the people in our lives. Maybe you've had a Zoom happy hour with friends you haven't seen in years. Maybe you've taken long walks with family, and noticed new things about your community. Maybe you've found yourself just sitting and doing nothing, and connecting with yourself. For those of us who lead frenetic lives, that can be a novel experience.  One useful exercise to practice in these times is to close your eyes and ask yourself what you will feel nostalgic about when you look back on the early months of 2020. What will you smile about? What will you miss? Thinking about the present through the eyes of your future self can tell you what is important and beautiful in your life right now. This exercise won't change how hard the pandemic has been for many people. It won't make all the losses disappear. But it will do what the war did for those people in Britain: It will tell you what you should be grateful for today.

             Speaking at the White House on Friday, President Trump said he was "terminating" U.S. ties to the World Health Organization. President Trump has announced that he is immediately halting the decades-long U.S. membership in the World Health Organization over its response to China's handling of the coronavirus epidemic. In a press briefing Friday at the White House, Trump said, "We will be today terminating our relationship with the World Health Organization and redirecting those funds to other worldwide and deserving urgent global public health needs." Trump said the decision came because WHO has "failed to make" reforms the U.S. requested. Last week, Trump sent a letter to WHO's director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, outlining his views on how the agency favors China and asking the organization to "commit to major substantive improvements within the next 30 days." It's not clear what specific reforms the U.S. has requested, because those discussions have not been made public. Nor did Trump say why he acted on the threat after one week rather than waiting a month. The U.S. was a major force in founding WHO in 1948 and is the organization's top funder, providing around $450 million a year, according to Trump. The level of funding the U.S. provides to WHO has been a sore spot for Trump, who complained at the briefing that the U.S. pays significantly more than China but does not wield more power in the agency. Global health experts said the president's choice to leave the global health governing body during a pandemic is a dangerous call. "This decision is really so short-sighted and ill-advised, and all it does is put American lives at risk," said Dr. Howard Koh, former assistant secretary for health in the Obama administration and now a professor at Harvard's  T. H. Chan School of Public Health.   "I disagree with the president's decision," said Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, in a statement after the announcement. "Withdrawing U.S. membership could, among other things, interfere with clinical trials that are essential to the development of vaccines, which citizens of the United States as well as others in the world need. And withdrawing could make it harder to work with other countries to stop viruses before they get to the United States." Dr. Tom Frieden, former head of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, noted: "The United States helped create the World Health Organization. And we're turning our back on it — we're turning our back on the world. That makes us less safe, it makes the world less safe.  "Every country in the world has a veto at WHO — except now, perhaps the United States will not." It's questionable whether the president can make a unilateral decision to withdraw from WHO.  "It is an overreach of his constitutional powers," said Larry Gostin, director of the O'Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law at Georgetown University. Gostin said he believes that the president may need congressional approval to terminate U.S. membership in the U.N. agency.  "The only situation where he can do this is if Congress had agreed beforehand to give these powers to the president," said Kelley Lee, a professor of public health at Simon Fraser University. "It is the role of legal advisers to inform the president on what authority he can exert. He is either not receiving good advice or not listening to it." If the president follows through, Congress could sue him in federal court over the matter, Gostin said, but Trump will still have succeeded in halting U.S. funding until the courts decide.   "It's a monumental decision," Gostin said, and one that in his view is ill-timed as the epicenter of the pandemic moves to low- and middle-income countries where WHO's efforts to stem the pandemic are crucial. "To have that disruption and delay is unforgivable," he said, "It will cost lives."

             Dr. Ming Lin was fired from his position as an emergency room physician at PeaceHealth St. Joseph Medical Center in Bellingham, Washington after publicly complaining about the hospital's infection control procedures during the pandmic. An emergency medicine physician from Washington state has filed a lawsuit to get his job back at a hospital. He was fired in late March after criticizing his hospital's response to the coronavirus pandemic. "This is about people on the front line being given the opportunity to speak out without being terminated and being reprimanded," says Dr. Ming Lin. Since 2003, Dr. Lin had worked in the ER at St. Joseph Medical Center in Bellingham, Wash., owned by health system PeaceHealth. As the coronavirus swept through Seattle, Lin started publicly outlining concerns about his hospital's handling of the pandemic. "I was calling other doctors" to find out what their hospitals were doing, Lin says, adding that he came to the conclusion that "our hospital wasn't doing adequate protection for the staff." On March 15, Lin shared on Facebook the text of a letter he had sent to the hospital's chief medical officer, pointing out the infection risks of how the hospital was testing for the coronavirus, and suggesting changes he thought the hospital should make, including checking the temperature of staff at the beginning of shifts and triaging patients outside the emergency room, in the parking lot. "For us to be so close to the epicenter and not do it is ridiculous," he wrote. He also described as "ludicrous" the ER protocol of first testing patients with respiratory symptoms for influenza, and waiting for a negative result on that test, before then giving the patient a coronavirus test: "[You are] not just exposing the staff member twice but exposing all patients by having the patient wait in the ER for the result." At the top of the Facebook post he wrote: "Hopefully I still have a job afterwards." Not long after, Lin was told that PeaceHealth was "super pissed" about the post. In the coming days, he continued to criticize the hospital on social media and in the press. At the end of March, Lin learned he had lost his shifts. His supervisor told him that while his comments were "intended to be constructive and a catalyst for change, unfortunately it is not possible for you to return," according to the lawsuit. 'Many of us have to speak out anonymously because we are afraid'  News of Lin's firing erupted on social media and in the press, especially among health care workers. Lin says the case isn't just about his situation. "It's about health care workers. We are repressed. We're not given opportunities to speak out," says Lin. "Many of us have to speak out anonymously because we are afraid." Lin works for TeamHealth, a company that contracts with hospitals to provide emergency room staffing. TeamHealth did offer to find Lin a new position for him in Oregon, or part-time work as a floating ER physician at other Washington hospitals, but for lower pay. Because of that, the lawsuit claims Lin was "effectively terminated from his job." In an online interview with media personality Dr. Zubin "ZDoggMD" Damania, PeaceHealth's Chief Operating Officer, Richard DeCarlo, addressed the controversy. DeCarlo alleged that Lin "posted misinformation, which was resulting in people being afraid and being scared to come to the hospital." "It wasn't true what he was posting," DeCarlo said. Lin cut off communication with his management team and created a "toxic environment," he added. "It appeared to us that he was unable to perform in that role." PeaceHeath did not agree to an interview with NPR, but released a statement that said Lin "chose to not use designated safety reporting channels, and his actions were disruptive, compromised collaboration in the midst of a crisis and contributed to the creation of fear and anxiety."

             Dr. Ming Lin at his home in Bellingham, Washington, March 27, 2020. Dr. Lin was fired from his position as an emergency room physician at PeaceHealth St. Joseph Medical Center in Bellingham after publicly complaining about the hospital's COVID-19 preparations. The American Civil Liberties Union of Washington is representing Lin in his lawsuit against both PeaceHealth and the physician staffing firm TeamHealth. "Rather than stifling speech and removing individuals that point out deficiencies in their practices, [hospitals] instead should listen, eliminate the problems that threaten people's health, and encourage the experts on their staff to come forward with solutions," Antoinette Davis, a senior staff attorney for ACLU-WA, said in a statement. The lawsuit claims wrongful termination in violation of public policy, breach of contract and defamation, among other things. "There are no questions at all about his competency as an emergency room physician," says Jamal Whitehead, an attorney who is helping the ACLU with Lin's case. "It was only when he reported concerns about the hospital's COVID-19 readiness that he was removed." Whitehead says the hospital retaliated against Lin for doing his duty and "speaking out to prevent harm from befalling himself, his colleagues and the public." "He's taken an oath, first and foremost, to do no harm," says Whitehead. Lin's firing came in the throes of the first wave of the pandemic and resonated with health care workers around the country who posted messages of support on his behalf. Nurses and doctors are often reluctant to speak publicly about safety concerns so as not to jeopardize their job. During the pandemic, some say they have been punished when they push for better protection. After Lin's firing, the American Academy of Emergency Medicine condemned the hospital administration's actions and called for an investigation, saying "it is an essential duty of a physician to advocate for the health of others." Legal protections vary widely for whistle blowers in health care  Harris Mufson, a partner with the law firm Proskauer, says the type of lawsuit filed in the Washington case can be difficult to win because it relies on common law. "Generally speaking those are more challenging to prevail on, particularly a public policy claim," says Mufson. He says when a health care worker pursues a whistle-blower claim, the legal strategy can depend on where the person works. Some states have laws that offer specific whistle-blower protections for health care workers, but others do not, and there are variations regarding whether those apply to public and private workers. "I do think this Washington case is emblematic of what employers are going to be facing around the country, both in the health care space and outside that space as well," says Mufson. Along with using state laws, health care workers can pursue cases of workplace retaliation in federal court, and by filing complaints with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), says Steven Pearlman, a partner with Proskauer. "We're going to see an avalanche of these types of claims," Pearlman says. OSHA has faced criticism during the pandemic for not being more responsive to worker concerns. That may drive health care workers to take other legal routes when facing retaliation, says Terri Gerstein, a labor attorney who directs the State and Local Enforcement Project at Harvard Law School's Labor and Worklife Program. Gerstein is also a senior fellow at the Economic Policy Institute. "It's so important that employers understand that when people raise these kinds of safety concerns, it's not an adversarial thing," she says. "They are trying to make their workplace safer and stem the spread of this horrible disease." But Gerstein doesn't necessarily expect a flood of lawsuits, in part because many workers nationwide are subject to forced arbitration. Dr. Lin's lawsuit seeks compensation for lost wages and for PeaceHealth to reinstate him at the hospital in Bellingham. "I'm just thinking about where to go from here... am I black listed with other hospitals?" Lin says. "I don't know."

             Yesenia Ortiz works at a grocery store in Greensboro, N.C. She says she wishes she would get paid more during the pandemic because of the extra level of risk to which she is exposed. Even under a mask, Yesenia Ortiz likes to wear her lipstick every day.  "You know Latina girls," she says, laughing.   She keeps a folded-up paper towel under the mask she wears all day, "because I don't want to ruin my mask." Ortiz works at a grocery store called Compare Foods in Greensboro, N.C., unloading trucks and restocking shelves.  Customers have been "asking me every day for alcohol, Windex, Clorox for wiping," Ortiz told NPR in late April. "Every day! 'Oh, we don't got none. We ran out. I'm so sorry.' They get so frustrated." And it's not just customers. Just leaving her home to go to work has been upsetting some people. For instance, when Ortiz was getting into her car, a neighbor came out and asked where she was going. FACES OF THE CORONAVIRUS RECESSION  Jobs lost. Businesses in peril. Meetings gone virtual. Faces Of The Coronavirus Recession offers snapshots of working lives upended by the pandemic.  "They question me like, 'Hey you! Are you violating the quarantine?' "  Ortiz told her neighbor she works in a supermarket, which is why she's been leaving her home.  As a low-wage worker, Ortiz says she wishes she would get paid more during the pandemic because of the extra level of risk to which she is exposed. To get paid more "would be a dream come true," she says.  As for the neighbor, Ortiz surprised her by getting her some groceries, "and she said, 'Oh my God, you sure?'

             British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Deputy Chief Medical Officer Dr. Jenny Harries and Chief Scientific Adviser Sir Patrick Vallance at a March news conference on the pandemic. That month, Harries stated that the World Health Organization recommendation for all countries to test extensively was meant more for lower income countries than for wealthy nations. The U.K. later changed its view. Most believe that the colonial era– the time from the 1400s to the late-1900s when rich countries took over poor countries, stripping their people of independence and taking advantage of their natural resources — is over. But the coronavirus pandemic makes it very clear that the legacy of colonialism is alive. Scholars have recognized that the modern-day control of social, economic, political and cultural aspects of former colonies by modern powers is still happening. They call it "neocolonialism." As public health experts who have worked extensively on global health issues,   we've been struck by how this neocolonialist attitude has played out in this unprecedented pandemic. The World Health Organization has sent a message to every country in the world during this pandemic: "Test, test, test."  But not every country felt the message was meant for them. In mid-March the coronavirus was spreading rapidly in many parts of the world, including the United Kingdom. Yet at a press conference, England's deputy chief medical officer, Dr. Jenny Harries, stated that the WHO guidelines did not apply to the UK's "extremely well-developed public health system.'" She explained that WHO's recommended approach for all countries were actually meant more for lower income countries. Needless to say, that philosophy did not stick. The government now recommends widespread testing and in fact set a target of 100,000 coronavirus tests per day across the U.K. by the end of April. The U.K. and other onetime colonial powers did not turn to their former colonies or to the East for advice – although they should have. African and Asian countries have had far more experience dealing with infectious diseases like Ebola and SARS than the United States and the countries of Europe. But neocolonialism relies on the continued belief that former colonial rulers are superior in terms of expertise and societal values. Not only are such attitudes racist and xenophobic, they're illogical. And it represents a kind of overconfidence that has literally been deadly. There was public knowledge of a viral respiratory epidemic threat from China in January, yet serious nationwide public health responses in the U.S. and U.K. did not start until March 2020. Even once it became clear that wealthy countries were at risk, there was a widespread reluctance to learn from China and from other Asian countries. The American reaction focused instead on blaming China – consider President Trump's use of the term "Chinese virus." China was further criticized for using draconian measures when millions of people in Wuhan were put under lockdown – even though the countries of the West that denigrated such tactics might today be better off if they had acted similarly. Indeed, recent data suggests that the majority of cases in the United States came from New York City. Restricting travel out of the city, as was done in Wuhan, might have meant far fewer cases in the U.S. And while Trump put an early ban on much travel from China, effective Feb. 1, he delayed any travel bans from European countries even as the virus toll mounted until mid-March. Today, we know that most of the cases in the eastern U.S. were of European origin. Then there is the matter of face masks. At first the U.S. made it seem as if wearing masks was based on superstition and had no benefit. So the message was that the mask-wearing citizens of China and other Asian countries were being foolish. As late as Feb. 29, the U.S. surgeon general Dr. Jerome Adams tweeted that masks do not offer any benefit to the average citizen. But the data is showing that universal masking could dramatically curb transmission. In April, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention did in fact change its earlier view and endorse the public use of cloth masks. To us, the hesitancy to adopt universal masking in public has been another example of Western arrogance. What's more, even former colonies are influenced by neocolonialism in the way they make decisions. Some of the solutions that work in the West are being imported by lower-income countries without consideration to whether they can work and what unforeseen consequences there might be. It's one thing for a country like Italy, Spain or the U.K. to call for a full-country lockdown. Many workers can switch to at-home work and not lose income. But in countries with widespread poverty, a lockdown immediately means the end of income for street vendors, construction workers and many others who earn their living day-by-day – and the very real threat of hunger as their income evaporates. Another argument for lockdowns is that if fewer people become ill, health-care systems will not be overwhelmed and will have time to acquire the equipment needed to treat COVID-19 patients. But in low-income settings, that kind of gearing up is much harder to accomplish. They already have far fewer ventilators, ICU-level beds and critical-care trained doctors. And the government doesn't necessarily have the ability to finance that kind of scaling up. One reason, in our opinion, is the nature of so-called "structural adjustment grants" offered to low-income countries by the World Bank since the second half of the 20th century. The idea was that the money would be used to build up the private sector rather than to strengthen essential social systems like health care. And these grants have a legacy of ongoing debt that countries are still paying back to this day.  Yet in spite of it all, we see some signs of hope – ways that the world is rejecting neocolonialism. A new attitude is emerging: The idea that countries that have responded to outbreaks for so long have something to teach the West. These countries that battled Ebola already have systems in place to do a job that everyone says is critical for controlling the novel coronavirus: contact tracing. They know how to gather information about all the contacts of a newly diagnosed person and then set up systems to isolate those contacts until the risk of infection has passed. We can and must adopt their expertise here as well – and we are. The state of Massachusetts is collaborating with global health group Partners In Health to use the contact tracing and isolation strategies that were initially honed in the Ebola response in West African countries like Liberia and Sierra Leone. There are also new partnerships to train community health workers, learning from the work of Last Mile Health, which leads such programs in Liberia. That's progress – but not enough progress. The lessons and expertise of the East and of African countries, coupled with the resources and power of the West, could have allowed us all to fare better. And as COVID-19 spreads globally, we will be called upon to collaborate. We need to make sure we answer that call.

             Rosalind Pichardo advertises a daily food giveaway service in the heart of Philadelphia's Kensington neighborhood, where more people die of opioid overdoses than any other area in the city. Before Philadelphia shut down to slow the spread of the coronavirus, Ed had a routine: most mornings he would head to a nearby McDonald's to brush his teeth, wash his face and — when he had the money — buy a cup of coffee. He would bounce between homeless shelters and try to get a shower. But since businesses closed and many shelters stopped taking new admissions, Ed has been mostly shut off from that routine.  He's still living on the streets. "I'll be honest, I don't really sleep too much," says Ed, who's 51 and struggling with addiction. "Every four or five days I get a couple hours."  NPR agreed not to use his last name because he uses illegal drugs. Philadelphia has the highest overdose rate of any big city in America — in 2019, more than three people a day died of drug overdoses there, on average. Before the coronavirus began spreading across the United States, the opioid overdose epidemic was the biggest health crisis on the minds of many city officials and public health experts. But the coronavirus pandemic has largely eclipsed the conversation around the opioid crisis. It still rages on despite business closures, the cancellation of in-person treatment appointments and the strain on many addiction resources in the city. When his usual shelter wasn't an option anymore, Ed tried to get into residential drug treatment. He figured that would be a good way to try to get back on his feet, and if nothing else, get a few good nights of rest. But he had contracted pinkeye, a symptom thought to be associated with the virus that leads to COVID-19, so the evaluation center didn't want to place him in an inpatient facility until he'd gotten the pinkeye checked out. But he couldn't see a doctor because he didn't have a phone for a telehealth appointment. "I got myself stuck, and I'm trying to pull everything back together before it totally blows up," he says. People in Ed's situation are exactly who Rosalind Pichardo wants to help. Before the pandemic, Pichardo would hit the streets of her neighborhood, Kensington, which has the highest drug overdose rate in Philadelphia. She'd head out with a bag full of snack bars, cookies and Narcan, the opioid overdose reversal drug. She'd hand Narcan out to people using drugs, and people selling drugs — anyone who wanted it. Pichardo started her own organization, Operation Save our City, which initially set out to work with survivors of gun violence in the neighborhood. When she realized that overdoses were killing people too, she began getting more involved with the harm reduction movement and started handing out Narcan through the city's syringe exchange. When Pennsylvania's stay-at-home order went into effect, Pichardo and others worried that more people might start using drugs alone, and that fewer first responders would be patrolling the streets, nearby and able to revive them if they overdosed.  So, Pichardo and other harm reduction activists gave out even more Narcan. A representative for Prevention Point Philadelphia, the nation's largest syringe exchange, says that during the first month of the city's stay-at-home order, they handed out almost twice as much Narcan as usual.  After the lockdowns and social isolation began, Pichardo worried that more people would be using drugs alone, leading to more overdoses. But Philadelphia's fatal overdose rate during the pandemic remains about the same as it was this time last year. Pichardo thinks that's evidence that flooding the streets with Narcan is working — that people are continuing to use drugs, and maybe even using more drugs, but that users are utilizing Narcan more often and administering it to each other.  But not always: Pichardo says users don't always have a buddy to keep watch, and first responders seem much more hesitant about intervening during the pandemic. For example, she recently administered Narcan to three people in Kensington who overdosed near a subway station, while two police officers stood by and watched. Before the pandemic, they would often be right there with her, helping.   To reverse the overdoses, Pichardo crouched over the individuals, who she said had started turning blue as their oxygen levels dropped. She injected the nasal spray into their nose, using a disposable plastic applicator. Normally, she would perform rescue breathing, too, but since the pandemic began she has started carrying an Ambu bag, which pumps air into a person's lungs and avoids mouth to mouth resuscitation. Between the three people, she says, it took six doses of Narcan to revive them.The police officers didn't step in to help, but did toss several of those doses at her as she worked.   "I don't expect 'em to give 'em rescue breaths if they don't want to, but at least administer the life-saving drug," Pichardo says. In her own work as a volunteer, she estimates she has reversed almost 400 overdoses. "There's social distancing — to a limit," Pichardo says, "I think when someone's life is in jeopardy, they're worth saving. You just can't watch people die." 
                Rosalind Pichardo, who grew up in Philadelphia's Kensington neighborhood, has reversed 400 overdoses by her own count.

             Rosalind Pichardo, who grew up in Philadelphia's Kensington neighborhood, has reversed 400 overdoses by her own count. Even before Philadelphia officially issued its stay-at-home order, city police announced they would stop making low-level arrests, including for narcotics. The idea was to reduce contact overall, help keep the jail population low, and reduce the risk of the virus getting passed around inside. But Pichardo and other community activists say the decreased law enforcement emboldened drug dealers in Kensington, where open air drug sales and use are common.  "You can tell they have everything down pat, from the lookout to the corner boys to the one actually holding the product — the one holding the product's got some good PPE gear," says Pichardo.  More dealers working openly on the street has led to more fights over territory, she adds , which in turn has meant more violence. While overall crime in Philadelphia and other major cities  has gone down during the pandemic, gun violence has spiked. Police resumed arrests at the beginning of May.    Now, when she goes outside to walk the streets and hand out Narcan, Pichardo has added a few things to her bag of hand-out supplies: face masks, gloves, and gun locks.  "It's like the survival kit of the hood," she says.  For those struggling with addiction who are ready to start recovery, newly relaxed federal restrictions have made it easier to get medications that curb opioid cravings and stem withdrawal.  Several efforts are underway among Philadelphia-based public health groups and criminal justice advocacy organizations to give cell phones to those who are homeless or coming out of jail, so they can make a telehealth appointment to quickly get a prescription for those drugs. And during the pandemic, people taking medication-assisted treatment can renew their prescription every month instead of every week, which helps decrease trips to the pharmacy. It is too soon to know if more people are taking advantage of the new rules, and accessing medication-assisted treatment via telehealth, but if that turns out to be the case, many addiction medicine specialists argue the new rules should become permanent, even after the pandemic ends. "If we find that these relaxed restrictions are bringing more people to the table, that presents enormous ethical questions about whether or not the DEA should reinstate these restrictive policies that they had going in the first place," says Ben Cocchiaro, a doctor who treats people with substance-use disorder.  Cocchiaro says the whole point of addiction treatment is to make help easy to get as soon as someone is ready for it. He hopes if access to recovery can be made simpler during a pandemic, it can remain that way afterward, too.

             Manager Mike Bonavita wears a protective mask as he cleans windows at the Quattro Italian restaurant in Boston on May 12 during the coronavirus pandemic. This month, Massachusetts' governor declared wearing masks mandatory. It has become a political and cultural flashpoint, drawing a clear divide between the "masked" and the "masked-nots." The disdain runs between the consciously unmasked president of the United States and his deliberately mask-donning Democratic rival, all the way on down to those crossing paths — and often crossing each other — in the cereal aisle of the grocery store. "It's selfishness. Complete selfishness," says 57-year-old Tia Nagaki, of the barefaced shoppers she has encountered. A resident of Denver, where masks have been mandatory since May 5, Nagaki concedes she tends to give the side-eye to people like that. But just as often, she says, the sneers come at her, as happened recently when a maskless guy came too close at the market. "He gave me a look, and then he started laughing at me like, 'Ha-ha, I don't care,' and making fun of me," she recalls. "We've made it very political. We've definitely politicized it." Indeed, a recent Quinnipiac University poll shows overwhelming support among Democrats for mask wearing, but a little more than one-third of Republicans feel the same. When Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam, a Democrat, announced a statewide mask mandate this week, he took pains to cast it as a more mild-mannered directive, with enforcement falling to health department officials, instead of police, and with no threat of jail time or fines for individual violators. "This is a matter of public health," he said. "I'm not looking for people to get in trouble by not wearing a mask, but I am looking for people to please do the right thing. I am asking people to respect one another." Still, Republicans immediately pounced, circulating pictures of the governor not wearing a mask in public just days before and blasting what they call "coercive" and "stifling burdens" on residents and businesses. It's the kind of politically charged resistance to mask mandates that has erupted around the nation and that has prompted officials to backpedal on mandates, reverse their position or get overridden by higher orders. Several controversial incidents have helped fuel the backlash, including one in Philadelphia when police aggressively yanked a black man off a public bus, as cameras rolled, and another in New York City that started with a woman in a subway station being stopped by police for not having her mask on properly and that ended with her in handcuffs on the floor in front of her 5-year-old son. Police say she was arrested for disorderly conduct, not failing to wear a mask; she is reportedly planning to sue the NYPD. Little wonder, police are loath to step into the fray. "This is not a good look for us, and it puts law enforcement in an extremely untenable position," says Joe Gamaldi, president of the Houston Police Officers' Union. When a local mandate was ordered there, he urged officers to use their discretion and issue warnings, not citations or fines. Having to enforce such a "draconian" mask mandate, Gamaldi says, would "erode trust that may be fragile with our black and brown communities" as well as with everyone else. Besides, he says, police are already stretched too thin and would better serve the public by focusing their limited resources elsewhere. As it turned out, enforcement of the mandate became a moot point when an executive order from Texas Gov. Greg Abbott barred local penalties for violations. But in jurisdictions that still have mandates, such as Virginia, businesses say it's unfair leaving it to them to step in to play "mask police," says Jodi Roth, director of government affairs for the Virginia Retail Federation. Restaurants and stores are more than willing to put up signs directing customers to wear masks, she says, but many refuse to be the ones to enforce compliance. It's unreasonable, she says, to ask employees who've signed up to be cashiers or servers, for example, to manage customers who become hostile, abusive or even violent. Many have seen incidents themselves when asking people to wear masks. Others have just read about violence that has erupted elsewhere, including at a Waffle House in Aurora, Colo., where a cook was shot after telling a customer to wear a mask, and at a Family Dollar store in Flint, Mich., where a security guard was fatally shot following a confrontation over a mask. The onus of enforcement, Roth says, should not be on businesses, which "have enough on their minds right now and are just trying to stay afloat." "They don't want to have to turn anyone away right now," says Roth. "They're just trying to get back on their feet and make customers happy." It should be left up to businesses to voluntarily impose stricter restrictions, she says. Lindsay Wiley, an American University Washington College of Law professor who specializes in public health law and ethics, tends to agree. Based on past experience ranging from HIV prevention to vaccines, she says, heavy-handed mandates can often backfire. That may be especially true in this case, given how President Trump has been spurning masks and how the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention flip-flopped on the matter, first imploring people not to wear masks before encouraging their use. "It can actually cause people who are skeptical of wearing masks to double down," Wiley says, and "reinforce what they perceive to be a positive association with refusing to wear a mask ... that they love freedom, that they're smart and skeptical of public health recommendations," all while bolstering the view that wearing a mask is a sign of weakness. Heavy-handed mask mandates only "pour gasoline on the problem," agrees attorney Jeff Childers, who has brought a legal challenge to a mask mandate in Alachua County, Fla., arguing it's unconstitutional. "It's not an objection to wearing a mask. It's an objection to being coerced to wear a mask," Childers says, adding that both he and his client recognize the health benefits and choose to wear a mask themselves. "I don't want to get too flag wavy on this," he says. "But isn't that really the foundation of our democracy, that we are a country of people who govern ourselves?" But public health and elected officials continue to push back, trying to prevent the politicization of basic health precautions. Mark Sexton, communications director for Alachua County, has posted more than 50 peer-reviewed articles about the benefits of wearing masks, in hopes of persuading residents to comply. "Under a state of emergency, when people's lives are in danger, our board feels like putting a mask on for a few minutes when you run into the grocery store is not too much to ask," he says, comparing it to being required to put on headlights while driving at night. "It's a reasonable thing," he says. And with the CDC recommending it, as well as Dr. Anthony Fauci, a top infectious disease expert and member of the White House's coronavirus task force, Sexton says, "it's common sense." And, common decency, as Denver Mayor Michael Hancock puts it. "So many people want to politicize this," he says. "But people are dying from this virus, and we need to do everything we can, regardless of party affiliation or ideological leanings, to protect them. Recently, Hancock says, he drove 4 miles from home to pick up something at Home Depot. When he got there, he realized he had forgotten his mask, so he promptly drove back home to get it, before returning to enter the store. "When I put on my mask, I'm doing it to protect them and to show compassion for my neighbor," he says. "And I hope they will do the same for me."Columbia, Brown, Penn, Purdue — universities with hallowed traditions, proud alumni and another thing in common: Right now they're being sued by disgruntled students. The students claim that when campuses shut down amid the coronavirus pandemic, they should have been entitled to more of their money back. And the list of institutions facing such challenges is growing, including private institutions and entire public systems in California, Florida, North Carolina and Arizona. The cases — now dozens in all — are raising difficult questions about what truly makes a college education valuable. Several law firms are handling these suits. One of the most prolific is Anastopoulo Law Firm in South Carolina, which specializes in personal injury. The firm has a colorful background: Its founder, Akim Anastopoulo, spent several years known as Judge Extreme Akim on a court television show called Eye for an Eye, where he meted out revenge, not just cash penalties, to losing parties. His firm has set up a website, CollegeRefund2020.com, to recruit plaintiffs for these suits and has filed more than 30 so far. When universities across the U.S. shut their doors because of the coronavirus pandemic and sent students home, many did offer partial refunds of dorm and activities fees. But, these lawsuits argue, they should have refunded more, because not only did students lose access to the gym, the dining hall, the in-person networking and parties, but their diplomas will always have an asterisk because they finished their degrees online. For example, a complaint by a student at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, says: "While closing campus and transitioning to online classes was the right thing for Defendants to do, this decision deprived Plaintiff and the other members of the Classes from recognizing the benefits of in-person instruction, access to campus facilities, student activities, and other benefits and services in exchange for which they had already paid fees and tuition." Few universities have commented publicly on the suits. Pace University spokeswoman Marie Boster told NPR in April: "The faculty, staff and leaders of Pace continue to work tirelessly to support our students during this challenging time." Boster pointed out that not only have educators continued to teach students all their regular courses, but the university is offering tutoring, counseling and other services as well. So, the school argues, tuition dollars are not really going to waste. Roy T. Willey IV, an attorney at Anastopoulo Law Firm who is overseeing many of the suits, dismisses that claim as "laughable." "Considering how they market their campus — experiential education and hands-on learning and the diversity on campus that you will avail yourself of if you pay these large tuition bills — it's an interesting position to take now that, 'well, we're able to provide the same thing online anyway.' " Some universities named in the cases already offer classes online for a lower tuition than they charge in-person students on campus, Willey pointed out. Deborah Hensler, a law professor at Stanford Law School, told NPR that these cases face an uphill battle in court. "I think these suits are a very long shot." First of all, she explained, the legal principle of force majeure means that a totally unforeseen event, like an act of God or a global pandemic, tends to void a contract. Willey counters that most of the students' agreements don't actually include a force majeure clause. And in any case, he adds, these suits are not for outright breach of contract. "The students here are very fair, very reasonable. And they're just asking for the difference between what they pay for and what they receive to come back to them." Second, Hensler pointed out that when it comes to universities in particular, there's a track record of what's called "judicial deference to academia." Basically, courts often recognize that universities deserve some autonomy when it comes to decisions related to scholarship and education. And finally, there's the substance of the legal claim itself. Here, Hensley invoked her personal experience as a faculty member who has been teaching online since Stanford University closed its campus. She has been assigning readings, grading papers and holding discussions over video. "In my personal opinion, I can deliver the same quality of education online as I could in person." But, she said, this might not be true for science students, for example, who need to be in a lab or for dance students who need to share a stage. Whether these lawsuits succeed or falter, they cast a shadow on the value proposition of college. Will universities going forward be able to charge the same tuition they're accustomed to for semesters that take place partially or entirely online?At the end of June, several thousand National Guardsmen from 15 states will descend on Fort Irwin in California's Mojave Desert for two months. The Army is already gaming out how to keep them healthy and able to train during the coronavirus pandemic. 
                Gen. Jim McConville, the Army chief of staff, visiting Fort Irwin in California's Mojave Desert. The Army is working to get back to large-scale training after a three-month hiatus due to concerns about the coronavirus.

             A sergeant barks out a command: "Soldiers completing the medical screening process come this way!"  The soldiers line up on a large concrete slab sheltered by a metal awning. All wear masks and stand 6 feet apart. A stiff desert wind picks up as a soldier gets ready for a quick health check. One of the soldiers walks up to an Army medical technician. "Are you experiencing any symptoms today, cough, shortness of breath or fever?" the technician asks. "Negative," says the soldier, as the technician holds a hand held thermometer, close to his forehead. The thermometer beeps, and she tells him he can go. No elevated temperature.  "OK you can face this line over here," she says.   If he'd popped hot, he'd be isolated from the other soldiers, taken for a virus test and maybe quarantined for two weeks. No training for him. This is all a simulation. But the Army's top officer, Gen. Jim McConville, watches it all closely. And turns to an officer. "You know we have to keep this as safe as we can when we bring the soldiers in," the general says.  McConville came up in the Army as a helicopter pilot and served a number of tours in Afghanistan, but in the last few months he's become well-versed on the virus, as well as such things as swabs and reagents and testing machines. "We going to have to make sure we can test," he says to a staff officer. "They're coming from all over the place. We have to make sure we can do that." These Guard soldiers will be the first to train here since March, when the coronavirus canceled and postponed field exercises for two other units.  The Army had to quickly adjust. Now all soldiers will be tested before they arrive. Buses bringing soldiers here will be half-full to allow for distancing. Tents will have fewer cots.  The officers walk into a massive tent the size of a high school gym. A sergeant major's voice echos as he points to the sea of green cots, all with the proper distancing. "If you notice all the cots that are across here, there's 6-feet spacing now," he says to the visitors from the Pentagon. And soldiers will alternate how they sleep. No longer head-to-head. "Head-to-foot to minimize impact," he says. Army leaders like McConville are eager to start large-scale combat training again of brigades, a unit with some 4,000 soldiers. Another training base in Louisiana next month also will welcome back hundreds of soldiers to prepare for its mission to Afghanistan later this year. McConville gives some advice to Brigadier Gen. Dave Lesperance, who commands Fort Irwin.

             Soldiers at Fort Irwin in California wear masks to protect themselves from the coronavirus. The Army wants to get back to training thousands of troops at a time. Such training has been sidelined by the virus. "And what I'm looking for is you have to minimize exposure, you really have to have social distancing," McConville says. "You really have to keep people apart, they have to wear their masks."  The National Guard soldiers will arrive here with their armor and artillery and head into a training area called "The Box." It's a sprawling desert expanse of mountains and hills the size of Rhode Island.  "The safest place for people to be will be in the desert," McConville says. "We call it social distancing in the civilian sector. You call it tactically dispersed out here. And they'll be tactically dispersed and they'll work through that."   There are some 4,000 soldiers permanently based at Fort Irwin, part of an opposition force, or Op For, that battles the visiting units. Their role is to play the enemy, and battle visiting units during simulations. Back at a conference room, Gen. Lesperance said he's had just a handful of positive virus cases here. The military hospital on post is equipped with three machines that can quickly turnaround a virus test.  "Right now we can do a 144," he says. "We want to  get to 1,000." At this point if he wants to do a lot more tests, he has to turn to a private lab in Phoenix. But the turnaround time is two to seven days. Gen. McConville says that's too much time for an Army unit to stand idle. The general shook his head. It wasn't long ago when the only talk at Fort Irwin was about weapons systems, how many rounds can it fire, and its range. "Now we're talking about how many people can you test with this machine?" says McConville. "How many of these do you have? How many of those do you have?" Gen. McConville says that's the message he'll carry back to Washington. Defensive measures are all very well, but the army needs more testing machines if it hopes to better hold off the coronavirus. And he realizes that he's not alone. Everyone — governor or mayor or even a general — wants more supplies.  Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffman said as training ramps up they will identify more machines. 
                The IRS has announced that with employer approval, employees will be allowed to add, drop or alter some of their benefits — including flexible spending account contributions — for the remainder of 2020.

             The IRS has announced that with employer approval, employees will be allowed to add, drop or alter some of their benefits — including flexible spending account contributions — for the remainder of 2020. The economic upheaval and social disruption caused by the coronavirus pandemic have upended the assumptions that many people made last fall about which insurance plan to sign up for or how much of their pretax wages to sock away in flexible spending accounts devoted to health care or dependent care. You may find yourself in a high-priced health plan you can no longer afford because of a temporary pay cut, be unable to get the medical care you might have planned and budgeted for or not be sending the kids to day care. Normally you'd be stuck with the choices you made unless you had a major life event such as losing your job, getting married or having a child. But this year, things may be different. This month, the IRS announced that it would let employees add, drop or alter some of their benefits for the remainder of 2020. But there's a catch: Your employer has to allow the changes. The new guidance applies to both employers that buy health insurance to cover their workers and those that pay claims on their own, called self-insuring. It's unclear how many employers will take advantage of the new flexibility to offer what amounts to a midyear open-enrollment period. If you're wondering what your company will do, ask. "If a consumer finds themselves economically strapped and their finances have changed, and they're in a situation where they really would like to rethink their coverage, they may want to approach their employer and see if they're planning to adopt any of these changes," says Jay Savan, a partner at human resources consultancy Mercer. Some health care policy experts are unimpressed with the new coverage options, noting that earlier this spring the Trump administration opted not to create a special enrollment period for uninsured workers to buy subsidized health insurance on the Affordable Care Act's health insurance marketplaces. "It's not likely that many people will take up this new coverage opportunity, and it won't address the problem of lack of coverage that many people are facing," says Sabrina Corlette, a research professor at Georgetown University's Center on Health Insurance Reforms. Assuming you're a worker who still has employer-sponsored coverage, here are examples of circumstances you may face and what the IRS changes could mean for you. You want to switch to a cheaper plan to put more money into savings during these uncertain times. Can you do that? If your employer decides to allow it, you can. One consideration: If you switch plans midyear, you may have to start all over again with paying down your deductible and working toward reaching your annual out-of-pocket maximum spending limit for the year, says Katie Amin, a principal at Groom Law Group in Washington, D.C., a firm that specializes in health care and benefits. "Some employer plans would credit you under the new option if you switched plans," Amin says. "It depends." You've got a high-deductible plan and are worried about high medical bills if you get COVID-19. Can you switch to a plan with more generous coverage? The IRS guidance allows it, but your employer probably won't, say experts. It's impossible for workers or their bosses to know who will develop COVID-19. But the concern among employers is that people willing to pay more for generous coverage may be sicker and have higher health care costs than other workers, and therefore could cost the plan more — a phenomenon called adverse selection. In addition to evaluating whether employees could benefit from midyear changes, an employer will weigh financial considerations, says Steven Wojcik, vice president of public policy at the Business Group on Health, which represents large employers. They'll ask, "What is the adverse-selection risk, and what is going to be the uptake [in coverage] if you open up enrollment?" he says. Under the new rules, if you haven't had health insurance on the job before but would like to sign up now, you can do that too, if your employer decides to permit it. What if one spouse gets laid off but the other is still employed? Can the couple switch its family coverage to the employed spouse's plan? Yes. But this was already allowed before the new IRS guidance came out. Under long-standing rules, if workers have a qualifying life event, they're entitled to change their coverage during the year. Can you drop your employer coverage altogether? Yes, if your employer permits it. Normally, once you sign up for health insurance through your employer and agree to have your premiums deducted from your paychecks, you can't drop coverage during the year unless you experience a qualifying life event. Under the new IRS rules, you can drop your coverage, but only if you replace it with another form of comprehensive coverage, such as coverage through a health insurance exchange or Tricare, the military health insurance program. One thing that won't qualify as comprehensive coverage, according to Amin: a short-term plan. The Trump administration has encouraged the adoption of limited-duration plans with terms that can last for nearly a year. But these plans don't typically cover preventive care or preexisting conditions, and renewal is not guaranteed. You've put thousands of dollars into a flexible spending account to cover day care expenses this year, but now the kids are home full time. Can you change the amount? Yes, but once again this is allowed only if your employer agrees to it. Likewise, if you want to increase your pretax contribution because you need to hire someone to care for your kids at home while you work, you can do that too. You can also establish a new FSA for dependent care expenses in 2020 if you don't already have one. Employees are legally entitled to put up to $5,000 annually into a dependent care FSA to pay for day care, preschool, after-school programs or summer camp. "Since it's the employees' money, my guess is employers will allow them to make changes," said David Speier, who is in charge of the benefit accounts group at human resources consultancy Willis Towers Watson. You planned to use money left over in last year's FSA to cover the cost of a medical procedure in early March. But that procedure was postponed because of the coronavirus crisis and you've missed the March 15 deadline for using those funds. Do you have any recourse? Under the new IRS guidance, employers can opt to extend the grace period for using leftover 2019 FSA funds through the end of 2020. Typically, those funds would have disappeared under "use it or lose it" rules if they hadn't been used by March 15. In 2019, the maximum pretax contribution to a health care FSA was $2,700; this year it's $2,750. Similar to the changes now permitted for dependent care FSAs, employers can also decide to permit workers to prospectively decrease or rescind their elected health care FSA amounts altogether. If you decide to stop contributing to your FSA, you can spend down the money that's accumulated there on health care expenses, but you can't cash out the account, says Amin. For example, if you've accumulated $500 in your FSA, you can use that money for eyeglasses or other approved expenses through the end of the year. But your employer can't give you the $500 outright, essentially cashing out the account. Employers have expressed a lot of interest in implementing the flexible spending account changes, says Mercer's Savan. "We expect them to have a lot of traction," he says.

             An election worker in Dallas setting up a polling place ahead of the March 3 in Texas. Texas officials are resisting efforts to expand mail-in voting due to the pandemic and insisting that voters cast ballots in person in upcoming elections. In an effort to keep voters safe, states of all political complexions are finding ways to expand access to mail-in ballots as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. Then there's Texas. The state has some of the most restrictive laws limiting vote by mail in the country. Under Texas law, the program is open only to people who are 65 or older, people who will be out of the county during the election, people who are in jail and not convicted, and people who are disabled. And after a series of often-contradictory court orders over the past month, it's still unclear whether more Texans will be able to use mail-in ballots during upcoming elections in July and November. There are currently multiple legal challenges to those policies working through various state and federal courts. Lower court judges have ordered the state to allow voters greater access to mail-in ballots during the COVID-19 pandemic. Higher courts have routinely overturned those orders – often a day or two later. The most recent legal decision, made by the Texas Supreme Court on Wednesday, said lack of immunity to the virus was not sufficient grounds for requesting a mail-in ballot. The legal battles come as President Trump and his allies are seeking to limit the use of mail-in voting, arguing with that the practice is more likely to lead to fraud. Years of studies and research indicate fraud in American elections is extremely rare. Multiple polls show that more than 60% of American voters would like access to mail-in ballots due to the pandemic. Democrats accuse Republicans of trying to minimize voter turnout because of the belief that Democratic voters would be less likely to cast a ballot in person than GOP supporters. While courts sort out the legal matter, voters like Leslie Riddel say they are doing what they can to make sure they can safely vote in upcoming elections. "I just know that my health risk will be increased if I go vote [in person]," Riddel, a 62-year-old former smoker who lives in Austin, said. She applied for a mail-in ballot several weeks ago. Who is disabled? Some of the legal disputes are currently over whether voters who are not immune to COVID-19 – which would include almost everyone – qualify for a mail-in ballot under the disability category. According to the Texas election code, "disability" means "a sickness or physical condition that prevents the voter from appearing at the polling place on election day without a likelihood of needing personal assistance or of injuring the voter's health." Riddel said she read the election code, weeks before the onslaught of court orders, and was convinced she qualified and decided she wasn't going to vote in-person while the coronavirus continued to spread throughout the state. "That is injurious to my health," she said. "And that's how I see it." In most states, polling places are indoors. Voters spend time waiting in line and touching equipment used by others, all factors that could increase the risk of contracting the virus. Wisconsin officials say at least 71 people who went to the polls in person during that state's controversial election last month were later diagnosed with COVID-19. Texas typically offers more than ten days of in-person early voting that state officials suggest is enough to prevent crowding at polling places. While voting rights groups in Texas agree with voters like Riddel, state officials don't. 
                Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton says he could prosecute voters who improperly request absentee ballots due to the coronavirus pandemic.

             Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton says he could prosecute voters who improperly request absentee ballots due to the coronavirus pandemic. Voter fraud prosecutions possible Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has said in statements that "fear of contracting COVID-19 does not amount to a sickness or physical condition as required by state law." He also said that his office would prosecute people for voter fraud if they use a mail-in ballot in a matter he said is improper. "We have to trust voters to do the right thing," Paxton said, "obviously if we found out someone has voted by mail and they have done it fraudulently, my job — just like the Michigan Secretary of State prosecuting voter fraud — my job is exactly the same." Paxton has a long history of prosecuting voters of alleged voting crimes in the state, which critics have said is an effort to intimidate voters. Tommy Buser-Clancy, a senior staff attorney with the ACLU of Texas, said Paxton's threats amount to voter suppression. "It's in line with Attorney General Ken Paxton's overall view that it should be harder and scarier to vote," he said. Buser-Clancy said voters who are not sure whether they are able to vote by mail should talk to their local election officials. But those officials are also limited in terms of what they can do. Voter confusion Jennifer Anderson, the elections administrator for Hays County south of Austin, said that by law, she has to grant a mail-in ballot to anyone who fills out a form for one. The law doesn't permit election officials to decide whether a voter qualifies for a mail-in ballot. All the recent court orders haven't made her work "that much different" and Anderson said it's up to voters to "assess their own circumstances." "So, if somebody selects the qualification of 'disability,' they don't have to explain to us why they made that qualification," Anderson said. Anderson said she's been hearing from a lot of confused voters in the past few weeks. In the meantime, she is preparing for an uptick in mail-in ballot applications ahead of the next elections. In Travis County, where Austin is, demand for mail-in ballots is "off the charts," according to county clerk Dana DeBeauvoir, who said "It doesn't compare to anything," that she's seen before. It's not clear if Paxton actually has the authority to prosecute voters who seek an absentee ballot to avoid coming into contact with the coronavirus. Leslie Riddel said she's not concerned. "Bring it on," she said. "He can prosecute me and I will stand my case. I feel I am in the right."There's no doubt we're living through a Big Historic Event, but that doesn't necessarily mean we'll remember it all that well.

             Bilal Chaudhry, 16, picks up a dozen eggs to give to a person in a car during a free egg distribution in Cumru Township, PA. The distribution was held to help people during the COVID-19 outbreak. We don't always behave the way economic models say we will. We don't save enough for retirement. We order dessert when we're supposed to be dieting. We give donations when we could keep our money for ourselves. Again and again, we fail to act rationally and selfishly — the way traditional economics expects us to. We've seen this during the coronavirus crisis: People selflessly mobilizing to help each other, like the retired Kansas farmer who sent an N95 mask to New York to help a nurse or a doctor. At the same time, though, we've also seen some people do exactly what economic theory assumes they will: Place their own self-interest above everything else. There are those who have even tried to profit from the pandemic, like the man in New York accused of stockpiling N95 masks to sell at an inflated price. Think about this man who hoarded masks and the man who donated a mask. In almost every sphere, our public and economic policies are designed around the assumption that most of us are going to behave like the first man. Legislators pass laws that take aim at transgressors. Regulators and police departments come up with rules that punish lawbreakers. Parents and teachers discipline truants. But what about all the helpers, like the man who donated his mask? What are the costs when we design our public and economic policies to focus on the crooks and wrongdoers? This week on Hidden Brain, we talk with two behavioral economists — Sam Bowles and Richard Thaler — about why economic models of human behavior regularly fail to describe how people actually behave. And we consider another question: can policies crafted with only selfishness in mind have perverse effects on the rest of us?

                Questlove has written two cookbooks, and pre-pandemic, was a frequent potluck host.

             Ahmir "Questlove" Thompson is not letting the pandemic slow him down. The Roots drummer, DJ, author and entrepreneur is still performing on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, DJ'ing live on Instagram, and he and his Roots' bandmate Tariq "Black Thought" Trotter recently signed a production deal with NBC. As if that weren't enough, tonight he's hosting Questlove's Potluck, a virtual dinner party on the Food Network. Even though Questlove is a cookbook author who, pre-pandemic, frequently hosted in-person potluck dinners and "Food Salons" with chefs, he says he wasn't sure hosting a TV special was a good idea. "I first thought 'Questlove's Potluck?' Like, who wants to talk about a hoity-toity dinner party in these times, especially when you can't do those things," he says. But then he noticed that with everyone at home all the time, people have "ramped up" their "creativity" around food. "There's a bunch of my friends from work who have these creative challenges with food." But he says, these days, they'll tell him "'Today I'm going to tackle this recipe,' and that sort of thing." Plus, Questlove wanted to raise money for a good cause, America's Food Fund. "So it was almost kind of like a no-brainer." A no-brainer because Questlove's friends include acclaimed artists and comedians like Tiffany Haddish, who made oil-less fried chicken which she calls "She Ready Chicken," singer Patti LaBelle, who made branzino, actress Eva Longoria, who made arroz con pollo, and actress and comedian Maya Rudolph, who made a cocktail in which she shamelessly substituted Gatorade for grapefruit juice. Questlove says he told them to keep the budget for whatever they cooked to $25 or under. That didn't seem too difficult for comedian Roy Wood, Jr., who showed Questlove his pantry with a warning that there were "a lot of things in this pantry that don't match, like almond milk and Oreos but they're both vegan, so I need you to relax." Questlove believes "Food is social adhesive." He says for years, as a touring musician, he rarely had family-style meals. Now, under quarantine with several other people, they have group meals together all the time, and it's not just about the food. "You have to bring an interesting topic to the table. You have to debate topics. And it's not just like you eat your meal and you leave," he says. "The rule that we have is that when we get up from this table, we have to learn something better about ourselves that we never learned before. So I love that." This is divine intervention, Mother Nature's way, or whoever, whatever divine force is watching us right now as a wake-up call for all of us to really look inside of us and be about that change. Ahmir 'Questlove' Thompson Questlove believes the pandemic is forcing people to think about who they are and what they stand for. During his most recent Tuesday night live DJ session on Instagram, he talked about how this week's high profile cases of racism and brutality against African-Americans left him feeling "raw." He says he's still processing how, as an artist and an activist, he should respond. "We've seen tragedy after tragedy after tragedy, a tragedy and often times, we just see the same. The same formula of ...'Oh this will soon be forgotten, like all those times we heard of school shootings. Three days later, we're just back to normal," he says. "I feel like [the pandemic] ... This is divine intervention, Mother Nature's way, or whoever, whatever divine force is watching us right now as a wake-up call for all of us to really look inside of us and be about that change. ... And so that's what I'm doing right now." This story was edited for radio by Rose Friedman and adapted for the Web by Petra Mayer.

             The Statue of Liberty is visible behind refrigeration trucks that function as temporary morgues at New York City's South Brooklyn Marine Terminal. "If you're driving by ... you might just assume that this was some sort of distribution hub," Time reporter W.J. Hennigan says. "But they are each filled with up to 90 bodies apiece." Editor's note: This interview contains graphic details that some readers may find upsetting. Of the roughly 100,000 Americans included in the official COVID-19 death count, 20,000 died in New York City in a period of two months. Time magazine reporter W.J. Hennigan recently spent several weeks looking into the practical challenge of how a city deals with so many bodies suffused with a deadly pathogen. Though he spent years as a war reporter, covering conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq, Hennigan says, "Nothing really prepared me for the level of devastation and the amount of death" in New York. "When you walk into a major U.S. city and you see the sorts of things that they're dealing with — racks of corpses and industrial warehouses full of people dedicated to processing the dead — it's not something that comes natural," he says. "The scale of it is incomparable to anything that we've seen." Hennigan's story, "'We Do This for the Living.' Inside New York's Citywide Effort to Bury Its Dead," describes the disaster morgues that have been operating around-the-clock during the pandemic. "This is not the sort of way that you'd expect your life to end — where you'd be stacked like cordwood in a refrigerated trailer at a marine terminal in Brooklyn," Hennigan says. "There are 200 of these trailers across New York, at every hospital. It's a haunting thing." On the South Brooklyn Marine Terminal, a major warehouse complex where the dead are being processed and held  It's essentially a distribution hub, if you can imagine, like an Amazon fulfillment center where trucks come and go, and it's right off of New York's inner harbor and it's opposite the Statue of Liberty, so you can see very clearly across the water. The warehouse complex itself there — there are three of them — and each warehouse building is the size of a football field or larger. And inside each of those are a mix of U.S. service members, state officials, city officials [and] emergency officials, all of them trying to help process the hundreds of bodies that are coming in each day. In the middle of the main facility, there is a military tent set up, and the bodies come through there on gurneys. The bodies are examined. They are tagged. The information is put into a computer system. Then they are wheeled to a 53-foot tractor-trailer. They're put on a rack. There are three tiers of wooden shelving. Their position on that trailer is documented — just like you would be if you went on an airplane, "Seat 31, row D." ... That trailer is wheeled out to the middle of the parking lot and put there until a funeral director can come pick the body up. ... All of the ramps and the loading bays and all this sort of thing is purpose-built for the processing of the corpses that are coming through there. It's a hive of activity, and it's being done day and night. They don't close operations. They go 24/7. W.J. Hennigan Inside of each of the warehouses, everybody's wearing a hazmat suit, like these hooded jumpsuits that protect them, and wearing gloves and visors. ... There are metal gurneys that are used. All of this has been put together fairly quickly. So all of the ramps and the loading bays and all this sort of thing is purpose-built for the processing of the corpses that are coming through there. It's a hive of activity, and it's being done day and night. They don't close operations. They go 24/7. On setting up the disaster morgues as an alternative to mass graves  I spent a lot of time with [First Deputy Chief Medical Examiner] Frank DePaolo, who's overseeing all the forensic operations and the COVID response. He's basically orchestrated this plan, which is establishing these emergency morgue units and this hub-and-spoke model of dealing with mass death, because Frank himself, he deals with these sorts of events, these emergency responses all over the world. He's often called in. For instance, when [the] Sandy Hook [school shooting] happened, he was called in to help out with that. When [the] Las Vegas [mass shooting] happened, he was called to help advise the people there. ... If it wasn't handled this way and if they weren't able to expand all their operations, bodies would have to be buried in a mass grave. I mean, that's just the reality. And people within the death care system told me that ... we were very close to going off the rails here. On the mass grave on Hart Island where unclaimed bodies go  In the early days of the pandemic they were ... so inundated with corpses that they were just incapable of holding them all. And this is before these emergency disaster morgues were established. There are now four of them across New York City in addition to the five brick-and-mortar facilities that the New York medical examiner's office operates. What the medical examiner had done is said, "We can't hold these corpses any longer. We need to be able to process the new ones that are coming in." And what they settled on was they would hold on to a body for 15 days. And if it wasn't claimed or picked up by a funeral director, it would be sent to Hart Island — which has, for over 100 years, been basically a mass grave where bodies are sent in simple, pine boxes and stacked on top of one another and buried by inmates from Rikers Island. ... Many bodies have been sent there. ... People are not able to get to their loved ones now; so many, many bodies go unclaimed. Something on the order of six times as many bodies have been sent there since this pandemic started. And that trend continues as people are unable to get out of their houses and claim their loved ones. On the overwhelming demand on funeral directors  I talked to a number of funeral directors, but the one that I document in the story is John D'Arienzo, who works in Brooklyn. He told me he knows 90% of the decedents that come through his funeral home. ... So the way that it typically works is that the funeral director is able to pick up the body basically whenever the family wants the body to be picked up. And the situation that they're facing now is they can't even get through to a funeral director. The phone is ringing off the hook, because so many people need the help. And for somebody like John, who knows the people in his neighborhood, who is having to turn away families because he's just so inundated in work, it breaks his heart. The purpose of a funeral director is to help families process death, to help them go through this grieving process. And if you can't even get through the front door, I mean, he feels like he's doing a huge disservice to his community. He says these sort of things with tears in his eyes. On the New York crematories running round-the-clock There are only four crematories in New York City and they are heavily regulated because of environmental concerns. Many are in communities, so there are a lot of strictures on the way that they operate. And they were only able to operate ... something like on the order of 12 hours a day, roughly. Because of [COVID-19] and because of the demand, New York loosened the restrictions on that time window, and they were able to operate 24/7. So crematories are now in business all day long. These are big ovens, brick ovens, and they are operating at up to 1,800 degrees, and they're just not supposed to be running for that long. So they need to have time down. But in two cases — out of the four crematories — they had their ovens collapse because of overuse. On avoiding the death care side of this crisis  There's been a lot of coverage on the front-line health care workers, and I think that makes sense. They make people well, or at least try to. But what's not been really as widely covered or understood, it is the death care side of things. Because the flip side of any pandemic is the death, and how that work is being handled. I think it's more of a philosophical question of the American psyche, of why we don't reflect on that, the sheer numbers of deaths that we've had in this country. I think there is an expectation and a hope that we get beyond this and maybe we don't want to confront the death. In a lot of ways, maybe we haven't really processed the numbers. I know for a number of people, it was hard to really imagine 100,000 people passing away as a result of this virus until they saw it on the front page of The New York Times, where just 1,000 of the 100,000 names were listed there. It's the same sort of emotion that strikes you when you stand in front of the Vietnam Memorial. We read about these things in textbooks. We've lived through them. But until you see the scope and the scale of this, that's when you get that pit in your stomach. Amy Salit and Seth Kelley produced and edited the audio of this interview.

             People line up in mid-April in Chelsea, Mass., to get antibody tests for the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. Mounting evidence suggests the coronavirus is more common and less deadly than it first appeared. The evidence comes from tests that detect antibodies to the coronavirus in a person's blood rather than the virus itself.  The tests are finding large numbers of people in the U.S. who were infected but never became seriously ill. And when these mild infections are included in coronavirus statistics, the virus appears less dangerous. "The current best estimates for the infection fatality risk are between 0.5% and 1%," says Caitlin Rivers, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. That's in contrast with death rates of 5% or more based on calculations that included only people who got sick enough to be diagnosed with tests that detect the presence of virus in a person's body. And the revised estimates support an early prediction by Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a leading member of the White House coronavirus task force. In an editorial published in late March in The New England Journal of Medicine, Fauci and colleagues wrote that the case fatality rate for COVID-19 "may be considerably less than 1%." But even a virus with a fatality rate less than 1% presents a formidable threat, Rivers says. "That is many times more deadly than seasonal influenza," she says. The new evidence is coming from places such as Indiana, which completed the first phase of a massive testing effort early in May. Indiana's program began soon after coronavirus cases began appearing in the state. The governor's office contacted Nir Menachemi, who chairs the health policy and management department at Indiana University's Richard M. Fairbanks School of Public Health. The governor wanted basic information, such as how many people had been infected, and how many would die.  At the time, "it was really difficult to know for sure," Menachemi says. "And frankly, not just in our state, but in any state." That was because health officials only knew about people who had been sick enough to get tested for the virus. And that number can be misleading, Menachemi says. "It doesn't capture the vast number of people out there who might be infected but not seeking medical care," he says. So starting in late April, Menachemi, working with the Indiana State Department of Health, led a study of more than 4,600 people statewide. Most were selected at random. Participants got two tests. The first was the standard test that looks for the virus. It shows whether you have an active infection. The second was a test that looks for antibodies to the virus in a person's blood. It detects people who were infected but have recovered. Preliminary results showed that the coronavirus had infected about 3% of the state's population, or 188,000 people. "That 188,000 people represented about 11 times more people than conventional selective testing had identified in the state to that point," Menachemi says. And 45% of the infected people reported having no symptoms at all.  For Menachemi and his team, it was like finally getting a glimpse of the entire coronavirus iceberg, instead of just the part above the water.    And the data allowed them to calculate something called the infection fatality rate — the odds that an infected person will die. Previously, scientists had relied on what's known as the case fatality rate, which calculates the odds that someone who develops symptoms will die. Indiana's infection fatality rate turned out to be about 0.58%, or roughly one death for every 172 people who got infected. And the results in Indiana are similar to those suggested by antibody studies in several other areas. In New York, for example, an antibody study indicated the state has an infection fatality rate around 0.5%.  Studies in Florida and California have suggested even lower fatality rates, but the results are less certain, Rivers says. "They may have enrolled people who are more likely to have been infected than would be ideal," she says, which would lead to an overestimate of infections and an underestimate of the infection fatality rate. An antibody study in Santa Clara County, Calif., used Facebook ads to find participants — a tactic unlikely to attract a random sample. Also antibody studies become less accurate when conducted in areas where the prevalence of infections is low. Calculating infection fatality rates in the U.S. is useful for researchers but less so for individuals who have been infected, Rivers says. "Thankfully, children and young adults are at low risk of severe illness and death," she says. "But older adults are at quite high risk." Studies suggest a healthy young person's chance of dying from an infection is less than 1 in 1,000. But for someone in poor health in their 90s, it can be greater than 1 in 10. And that means different states in the U.S. should expect different infection fatality rates, says Juliette Unwin, a research fellow at Imperial College London.  "Places like Maine and Florida, we find that the infection fatality ratio is higher than in other places where the demographic is younger," she says. Unwin is part of a large team in the United Kingdom that is monitoring both infection and mortality from the coronavirus in the United States. The team puts the infection fatality rate for the U.S. at somewhere between 0.7%  and 1.2%. "That will be subject to change and revision, as is everything in science," says Samir Bhatt, a senior lecturer at Imperial College London. "But I don't think we have it an order of magnitude out." To get a more precise estimate of infections and the infection fatality rate nationwide, the National Institutes of Health has launched an antibody study   that will test 10,000 people. Results will be released on a rolling basis. The study is expected to wrap up in early 2022.

             In this photo illustration, a person looks at an abortion pill (RU-486) for unintended pregnancy from Mifepristone displayed on a smartphone on May 8, 2020, in Arlington, Va. Under federal law, even in states where telemedicine abortion is legal, there are strict rules surrounding how the pill is dispensed. Even before the coronavirus crisis, there were lots of abortion restrictions in South Dakota. But now the procedure has become unavailable, officials say.  "I called to make the appointment and they said the Sioux Falls location was closed [for abortions] because of the coronavirus," said 34-year-old Heather. NPR agreed not to use her last name because she doesn't want people in her largely conservative community to know about her abortion.  During the coronavirus pandemic, more healthcare is moving online — including abortion. In many states, abortion pills can be prescribed remotely, and abortion providers are reporting a growing number of women seeking medication abortions through telemedicine. But others are finding obstacles in their way.  Heather lives in Sioux Falls, S.D., and has two small children. One of her kids is being treated for a rare form of cancer and Heather said she and her partner felt they couldn't handle another pregnancy now. "Somebody can only take so much, I guess," she said.  Between layers of restrictions on abortion, and a lot of social stigma, Planned Parenthood officials say they've been unable to find a South Dakota-based doctor to perform abortions. So for 25 years, the organization has been flying physicians in and out, several times a month, to provide the procedure at the state's only abortion clinic in Sioux Falls. But now, even that's not possible, said Sarah Stoesz, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood North Central States.  "It's been very difficult for women to access abortion since COVID-19 because of course we can't fly doctors to South Dakota anymore," she said. Stoesz oversees clinics in several Midwestern states. Her region has seen a 250% increase in the use of telehealth for all types of care since social distancing restrictions took effect. In Iowa, where telemedicine abortion is legal, the organization reports a 33% increase over about a month.  But abortion through telemedicine is not legal in South Dakota. "That means that there is no abortion access in South Dakota right now," Stoesz said. According to the Guttmacher Institute, which supports abortion rights, 18 states prohibit doctors from prescribing abortion pills remotely. In places where the practice is legal, doctors say they're hearing from more patients seeking abortions this way. "I think what they're seeing is that most of their health care has moved to an online or a tele-platform," said Dr. Colleen McNicholas, an abortion provider in Illinois, Kansas, Missouri and Oklahoma. "So we are constantly getting folks asking questions about that. And unfortunately, in most of the places that I work in the Midwest, that's just not an option." In New York, a state with more liberal abortion laws, Dr. Meera Shah is chief medical officer at Planned Parenthood Hudson Peconic, outside New York City. Shah said she has stepped up the use of telehealth for all types of reproductive health care, including abortion for patients in the early stages of pregnancy.  "I had a patient the other day who is an emergency responder who was sitting in her ambulance and accessed abortion care via telemedicine and then drove her ambulance to our health center to pick up the meds," Shah said. "And she was so grateful that she was able to do that and only take, you know, max 15 minutes away from her work." Under federal law, even in states where telemedicine abortion is legal, there are strict regulations surrounding how mifepristone is dispensed.  Reproductive rights advocates want policy makers to ease restrictions on the drug – especially during the pandemic. They point to the United Kingdom, where regulators have eased rules for medication abortions in response to the coronavirus crisis. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has sued the federal government, asking that rules requiring patients to pick up the abortion pill mifepristone at a medical facility be suspended. But Dr. Christina Francis, with the anti-abortion rights group the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists, supports strict controls on abortion pills. She opposes abortion, but said if a woman is going to have a medication abortion, she should see a doctor first to confirm how far along the pregnancy is and check for other complications. "I will tell you as a woman, and as a physician who sees women: I love women; I think we are intelligent. But we are notoriously bad about knowing our last period and being able to date pregnancies that way," Francis said. Abortion rights advocates point to research suggesting patients receiving abortion pills through telemedicine have similar outcomes to other types of abortion, and the fact that groups including ACOG say the safety of medication abortion is well-established. For Heather, South Dakota's restrictions on telemedicine abortion meant taking a different type of risk: driving to a clinic in Omaha, Neb., about three hours each way, where she was prescribed abortion pills to take home. Several weeks ago, she and her partner packed cleaning supplies and loaded up the kids — even though she knew it could be dangerous during a pandemic. "I just didn't want them touching anything," she said. Heather isn't alone; officials at Planned Parenthood say more than 60 patients from South Dakota have traveled to clinics outside the state for abortions since the pandemic began. "It was something that I needed to do," Heather said. "And I was gonna have it done, whatever lengths I had to go to, whatever obstacles they put in front of me."

             People wear face masks in Sanaa, Yemen, as health workers fumigate a market over concerns about the spread of COVID-19. In the Yemeni city of Aden, doctors and nurses of Al-Wali Hospital and their families have become patients. With the 75 beds in this private hospital now full, members of the public are being turned away. "Right now, we can't accept anyone else," said Amr Al-Turkey, a critical care physician in the hospital who is recovering from COVID-19.  Across the city, medical staff and their relatives are falling ill with COVID-19, doctors and aid workers have told NPR. As the coronavirus spreads, there are soaring numbers of infected patients, while the health care facilities lack everything from protective gear for staff to beds for the ill to specialist expertise.     Turkey's account comes as the aid group Doctors Without Borders, which goes by MSF, the acronym of its name in French, warns a "catastrophe" is unfolding in the city because of the coronavirus. MSF runs the only facility dedicated to treating COVID-19 patients. It's based in Aden but cares for the sick from all across southern Yemen. From the end of April until now, just over 200 patients have been admitted, and of those close to 100 have died.  The aid group said the number of deaths in Aden from the coronavirus is likely much higher.  Thierry Durand, MSF's coordinator of operations in southern Yemen, said the organization's staff there is sometimes left feeling "powerless." Speaking to NPR shortly after leaving Aden as part of his work rotation, he described medical teams working day and night even as patients, colleagues and loved ones died before them.  "The only way to help people pass the peak of this disease is with oxygen therapy, with or without mechanical ventilation," Durand said. But not enough is available. "So we are seeing people dying quickly – in a matter of a few hours."  The staff is also directly affected. Between the COVID-19 clinic and another hospital in the city where staff work, Durand said 40 of MSF's health care workers are sick – some from diseases such as dengue but many from the coronavirus. Their relatives are falling sick, too. "One of our doctors brought his mother into the clinic during the night. In the morning, she was dead," Durand said. "And he is now sick." Last week MSF called on the United Nations and donor states to do more to help. Yemen has a long list of needs: from funds to pay health care workers to supplies of protective equipment for medical staff to oxygen to help patients breathe.  But the U.N. warns that the funding for its programs in Yemen is heading toward a "fiscal cliff."   The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs  said at a press conference this month that if donor countries don't step up, some of its operations "that are very much essential to fighting back against [COVID-19], will have to close." In response to the coronavirus, the U.N. in Sanaa has allowed some staff usually based in the capital to leave the country and work outside Yemen.  A U.N. official who asked not to be named because he did not have authorization to speak on this issue told NPR that only those staff who could work remotely have left and that the change has not affected ongoing aid operations.  Yemen already suffers what the U.N. is calling the world's most extreme humanitarian crisis. Some 24 million people – close to 80% of the population – need aid. More than 20 million people across the country are food insecure, and the country has the worst cholera outbreak in modern history, with more than 110,000 suspected cases recorded in April.  Despite multiple attempts at a cease-fire, the war there continues. The country is divided between the Aden-based government, which is backed by Saudi Arabia, and Houthi militias who control the capital, Sanaa, and much of the north. The Houthis receive support from Iran, Saudi Arabia's regional rival.  Infighting between Saudi-aligned factions further complicate the picture. Last month the Southern Transitional Council separatist movement declared "self-rule" in Aden. Its militia seized some government offices and the central bank. Governors of some of the affected provinces rejected their calls, but the region is now even more unstable.  In the midst of all this, MSF's Durand said that in Aden officials had taken little action to tackle the coronavirus outbreak. "Nobody wanted to know or admit that it was circulating," he said. "There was little talk of the isolating [through lockdowns and quarantines] or testing. Until, at the end of April, they couldn't escape it anymore." Local authorities repurposed a hospital that had been defunct for two years into a treatment center for COVID-19 patients. MSF helped with the repairs and eventually took over its management. During the holy Muslim month of Ramadan that began April 23, where families, friends and neighbors gather to break the daily fast, the number of cases "just exploded," Durand said.  The health ministry of the Aden-based government reports 212 confirmed cases and 39 deaths – far lower than even the number of fatalities seen at the COVID-19 hospital run by MSF.  Meanwhile, Houthi authorities in northern Yemen have yet to publish much data on the spread of the disease in their areas. In Sanaa, two medical centers have reportedly been turned into COVID-19 isolation units.  Doctors have petitioned authorities to provide protective gear to all hospitals in the city. Areej Haider, 31, a medical student in her final year of study, works in the emergency unit of Al-Thawra, the biggest hospital in Sanaa. She said the hospital is seeing some patients with symptoms of COVID-19 but doesn't have the equipment to test for or manage the disease. Haider grew up in Aden and said she knew three of the doctors there who have succumbed to COVID-19. When her medical supervisor also contracted the virus, his students – some of them now emergency medical specialists – worked to keep him alive. "He was on a ventilator for 10 days," she said. Aden doesn't have respiratory specialists. Haider said Yemeni doctors who do have that expertise, some now abroad, "gave advice remotely." Two former students stayed by her supervisor's hospital bed and helped manage his ventilation according to the "correct protocols."  "Now he is home," she said. When not at the hospital, Haider gives medical consultations by phone from home. She has distributed her number through friends, colleagues, Facebook and WhatsApp. "Some of the people who call me have symptoms of coronavirus. Others have other diseases, like malaria," she said. She tries to help them remotely by prescribing medicine or requesting tests.  With many hospitals in Aden are unable to admit patients, especially those displaying a fever or other symptoms of COVID-19, this kind of remote visit may be some people's only chance of medical help.

It's a celebration of hard work; a well-earned break from studying and stress. Frozen in time — often to the delight and amusement, decades later, of future generations — are cultural trends in fashion and hair: Why did you pick that dress? Sneakers with a suit — really? Yet for the class of 2020, that whole experience has been taken away. Ending their educational careers with schools shut down amid a global pandemic wasn't how they imagined marking this milestone in their young lives, or beginning the transition to whatever comes next. Photographers Susan Sterner and Tyrone Turner wanted to give high school seniors in the Washington, D.C., area (Turner is a photojournalist at member station WAMU) a chance at that moment. They set out with their cameras to memorialize — for the young people and for us — that moment at the end of a long road when students dress up to look their best and say, "We made it." Here are some of those portraits.

             Registered nurses and other health care workers at UCLA Medical Center in Santa Monica, Calif., protest in April what they say was a lack of personal protective equipment for the pandemic's front-line workers. The coronavirus continues to batter the U.S. health care workforce. More than 60,000 health care workers have been infected, and close to 300 have died from COVID-19, according to new data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The numbers mark a staggering increase from six weeks ago when the CDC first released data on coronavirus infections and deaths among nurses, doctors, pharmacists, EMTs, technicians and other medical employees. On April 15, the agency reported 27 deaths and more than 9,000 cases of infection in health care workers. The latest tally doesn't provide a full picture of illness in this essential workforce, because only 21% of the case reports sent to the CDC included information that could help identify the patient as a health care worker. Among known health care workers, there was also missing information about how many of those people actually died. Still, the growing number of health care workers infected by the coronavirus provides sobering evidence that many are still working in high-risk settings without reliable or adequate protection against the virus. "It is underreported," says Zenei Cortez, president of National Nurses United (NNU), the largest union of nurses in the country. The union has compiled its own count of more than 530 health care fatalities from COVID-19, using publicly available information like obituaries. A recent NNU survey of 23,000 nurses found that more than 80% had not yet been tested for the coronavirus. Across the country, many nurses say they still don't have enough personal protective equipment (PPE) such as masks and gowns and are required to reuse N95 masks and other supplies — practices that were considered substandard before the pandemic. Many hospitals and nursing homes continue to operate with inadequate supplies and are rationing them. "Everything is under lock and key. If you are going to respond to an emergency, you sometimes have to wait for someone to unlock a cabinet," Cortez says of some hospitals' PPE supplies. Cortez cites the death of a nurse from Southern California who rushed to the bedside of a COVID-19 patient who had stopped breathing. The nurse was wearing only a surgical mask, which offers less protection against airborne infection than the closer-fitting N95 respirator mask. "Fourteen days after that incident, she died because she contracted the virus," Cortez says. "If the PPE was readily available, she maybe could have put on the N95 mask and been prevented from getting the virus." Cortez worries that some of these unsafe practices around infection control have become normalized in U.S. health care settings and will persist in the coming months as the country reopens. NPR recently reported that in the spring of 2017 the Trump administration halted the final implementation of new federal regulations that would have required the health care industry to prepare for an airborne infectious disease pandemic. Consequently, there are no federal workplace rules that specifically protect health care workers from deadly airborne pathogens such as influenza, tuberculosis or the coronavirus. "The really sad thing is not having solid numbers from many states," Pat Kane, executive director of the New York State Nurses Association, says regarding the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths among health care workers. Early in the outbreak, Kane says, many nurses could not get tested. Her own statewide union has lost more than 30 nurses in the pandemic. "Some of them actually died outside of the hospital, trying to recover at home," she says. More than half of the nurses in the New York state union still report not having enough personal protective equipment. "In some places, we still see people operating under contingency and crisis guidelines," she says. In early May, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo touted the results of an antibody testing survey that showed a 12% infection rate among health care workers in New York City, compared with the 20% infection rate among residents citywide. But Kane says that lower number isn't something to celebrate. "Our members showed up and many of them made the ultimate sacrifice," she says. "And many of them got sick. That was Round 1. We should be better informed by our experience." As more regions in the United States reopen, the safety of health care workers needs to be a key benchmark for decision-makers, Kane says, and must include enforceable precautionary standards — not just voluntary guidelines for employers, which shift according to the amount of PPE available. At Northwestern University, Dr. James Adams says the number of health care workers with COVID-19 dropped significantly after his hospital started requiring everyone on-site to wear masks. Adams says closely tracking the full extent of the COVID-19 burden among health workers will be crucial as access to testing improves. "Up to this point, we have largely not known what is going on with the workforce and this infection rate," says Adams, a professor of emergency medicine. "What we need is the confidence of health care workers, and we should track this in order to ensure their health."

             Medical personnel test people in vehicles for COVID-19, at Annandale High School, in Annandale, Va., on May 23. There's a new bottleneck emerging in coronavirus testing: A shortage of the machines that process the tests and give results. Coronavirus testing in the U.S. has run into a number of snags, from a lack of nasal swabs to not enough chemicals needed to run the tests. Now there's a new bottleneck emerging: A shortage of the machines that process the tests and give results. Civilian labs and the Pentagon say they've had trouble getting the sophisticated, automated machines that can run hundreds of diagnostic tests at once. Three machine manufacturers — Hologic Inc., Roche and Abbott Laboratories — have confirmed to NPR that demand is outstripping supply. Public health experts say the machine shortages are upending a complicated supply chain just as the shortages of swabs, chemicals and other testing materials have begun to ease. Experts warn the lack of machines will hold the U.S. back from ramping up diagnostic testing to better understand where the coronavirus is spreading and how to stop outbreaks. "We're gonna get stuck again," said Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute. "We keep sort of fixing one bottleneck, and testing gets a bit better, and then we get stuck with the next bottleneck." The Trump administration has released a plan to ramp up testing, saying it would provide strategic direction and technical assistance, but mostly leaving responsibility for executing the plan to the states. Coronavirus testing in the U.S. is carried out by a patchwork of commercial labs, hospitals, local health departments and other institutions. The administration's coronavirus testing coordinator, Admiral Brett Giroir, says that plan is working. "Right now in America anybody who needs a test can get a test in America with the numbers we have. ... That's over three million tests per week," Giroir said at a White House briefing earlier this month. 
                Adm. Brett Giroir, assistant secretary of Health and Human Services, speaks about the coronavirus in the James Brady Press Briefing Room of the White House on April 17. The Trump administration has released a plan to ramp up testing and Giroir says that plan is working.

             Adm. Brett Giroir, assistant secretary of Health and Human Services, speaks about the coronavirus in the James Brady Press Briefing Room of the White House on April 17. The Trump administration has released a plan to ramp up testing and Giroir says that plan is working. Jha and other public health experts say that may be enough tests in some places — but only because not enough people are getting tested. "It is not nearly enough, certainly not enough to open up safely and remain open," Jha said. At a minimum, Jha says the U.S. needs to be testing twice as many people — 7 million per week. That means the country is going to need more swabs, more testing kits, and more testing machines to run them. Four months into the pandemic, Jha says, the nation still isn't ready. Heather Pierce, senior director for science policy for the Association of American Medical Colleges, says labs at teaching hospitals have reported difficulties in getting testing machines. She says that has exacerbated supply chain problems. "Those machines have been part of the bottleneck," she said. "In fact, even institutions that had ordered those machines prior to the pandemic found their orders were cancelled or delayed, and some still haven't been shipped." Even the U.S. Army is finding it can't get some coveted testing instruments. The Chief of Staff of the Army, Gen. James McConville, told NPR the Army has been unable to secure more of the machines that can handle a greater volume of tests. More testing is needed to get back to training large numbers of troops. McConville toured the Fort Irwin National Training Center in California earlier this month, where he questioned the base staff about their capacity to test for the coronavirus. The soldiers told him they want a machine known as the Panther, a top-of-the-line, automated testing instrument made by the pharmaceutical company Hologic. It can run more than 1,100 tests a day. General McConville called it the "granddaddy" of testing machines. But McConville said there aren't enough of them on the market. He told the soldiers: "Realistically, you won't get Panther." Three manufacturers confirmed they have not been able to meet the demand for new testing machines. One of them was Hologic, the company that makes the Panther. "Given the unprecedented demand, we cannot provide new instruments to every lab that wants one, at least not right away," Mike Watts, Hologic's vice president of investor relations and corporate communications said in an email. Watts stressed that there are already more than 1,000 Panther machines, which are used for other medical tests as well, installed in labs in all 50 states. "So overall, we believe availability of Panthers is accelerating, not constraining, national testing," Watts said. Roche and Abbott Laboratories say they've also had trouble filling orders for some big instruments. All three companies say they're doing everything they can to scale up production. Roche spokesman Mike Weist said the company is even shipping out demonstration and training models. "Every available instrument, including instruments repurposed from internal use (such as training, demonstration, clinical trials), has been shipped or allocated for shipment in order to increase testing capacity worldwide," Weist said in an email. Still, Harvard's Jha says more needs to be done. "This is a classic market failure," Jha said. "This is not something that the market is going to sort out onto itself." It's not just about ramping up production of these machines, Jha says. To get testing to more than double where it is today, he says labs need to invest even more in a lot more equipment. But the testing machines are expensive. And the pandemic has caused an economic meltdown. Now some labs are saying they're not sure they can justify the expense of adding more instruments. What if infection rates decline? What if people don't come forward to get tested, or think they don't need to unless they're really sick? That is, after all, what many public health officials were saying for months when tests were scarce. "This is a place where I think the government just needs to step in and pay companies — buy the machines for companies, or pay large amounts for these tests," Jha said. "This is what many of us have been asking for from the federal government. ... And it's very frustrating." He's not the only one who is looking to the federal government to play a bigger role. "There's broad agreement about the need for testing," said Julie Khani, president of the American Clinical Laboratory Association, which represents commercial labs. "There has been something of a disconnect, however, between the need for testing and providing the necessary support and resources for laboratories to grow and expand that testing," Khani said. Khani's organization wrote to the Trump administration in April, asking for $10 billion in emergency relief funds to buy more testing machines for their labs. The group is still waiting for a response. NPR Correspondent Tom Bowman and Senior Producer Walter Ray Watson contributed to this report.

             Marc Short, chief of staff to Vice President Pence, listens during a coronavirus briefing with health insurers at the White House on March 10. Marc Short, the chief of staff to Vice President Pence, owns between $506,043 and $1.64 million worth of individual stocks in companies doing work related to the Trump administration's pandemic response — holdings that could run afoul of conflict of interest laws. Many of the medical, pharmaceutical and manufacturing companies – including 3M, Abbott Laboratories, Gilead Sciences, Procter & Gamble, Medtronic, Bristol Myers Squibb and Johnson & Johnson – in which Short and his wife hold stock have been directly affected by or involved in the work of the coronavirus task force chaired by Pence. Other companies among his holdings, such as CVS, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Walmart and Roche, have been publicly touted by the White House for their work with the federal government on the coronavirus response. Short declared at least some of his stock holdings — more than 100 listings of individual stocks across a range of economic sectors — to be potential conflicts of interest after he joined the vice president's office last year. But he did not divest those holdings after being denied a tax break often granted to government officials who must sell stock to comply with ethics laws.  Loading...  Short still holds the stocks — some in trusts for family members — which he disclosed in public records reviewed by NPR. The White House contends he has followed administration guidelines to avoid conflicts of interest. "Marc Short has followed all applicable ethics laws, and even sought to divest from potential financial conflicts," said Pence spokesman Devin O'Malley. "Additionally, on several occasions, including since the formation of the coronavirus task force, Mr. Short has worked with legal counsel to implement appropriate recusals." Watchdogs — including the former top lawyer for the Office of Government Ethics, which handles conflicts of interest issues — say that in order to comply with the law, Short needs to divest or recuse himself from issues that may impact his personal financial holdings. There is a law that requires executive branch employees to resolve conflicts of interest before participating in any decision — or even deliberations — affecting particular companies or specific industries in which they are invested. Violations carry potential civil and criminal penalties. The law extends to the holdings of spouses and minor children. It is unclear at this point whether Short has participated in any governmental policy decisions that could affect the companies or sectors in which he holds personal financial interests. But recusal may be difficult because of Short's expansive list of responsibilities as the vice president's chief of staff — and in any case, there is public evidence that he is actively engaged in the Trump administration's coronavirus response efforts. Short is a longtime political operative who has served as Pence's chief of staff since March 2019. He has also taken on a public role in the coronavirus task force operations. And on at least two recent occasions, his work has led him to mention companies in which he holds stock. On March 18, he mentioned the vice president's trip to a 3M manufacturing plant to illustrate a point about liability protections. Records show that he holds between $65,002 and $150,000 worth of 3M stock. On March 20, he publicly hailed the work of Honeywell in producing respirator masks. According to public disclosure records, he holds between $50,001 and $100,000 worth of Honeywell stock. The former director of the Office of Government Ethics, Walter Shaub, said he thinks an independent investigation should be launched. Since leaving the OGE in July 2017, Shaub has become a frequent critic of the Trump administration on ethics issues. "This is now a red alarm. We have enough information to know that there is a serious possibility of a conflict of interest and a very realistic chance that he may have participated in matters affecting his financial interests," said Shaub, now with the government watchdog Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, or CREW. "We won't know unless the FBI or the Public Integrity Section for the Justice Department do a proper investigation." According to public disclosure forms first obtained by CREW and subsequently verified and reviewed by NPR, Short owns between $506,043 and $1.64 million worth of stock in companies that have been specifically identified or otherwise involved in the federal government's coronavirus response. Public disclosure forms do not show precise values of stock holdings, only ranges. O'Malley, the spokesperson for the vice president's office, said that Short sought what is called a certificate of divestiture from the Office of Government Ethics. The certificate is not necessary to divest from stocks, but it does approve a tax break that allows the deferment of capital gains tax and is designed to reduce the burden of complying with federal ethics laws. The application for a certificate of divestiture is in itself an acknowledgement that the likelihood of potential conflicts of interest exist. In order to apply for the certificate, federal employees need to attest that they have possible conflicts of interest that make it necessary to divest, according to Don Fox, a former general counsel and acting director for the Office of Government Ethics. "There has to be an underlying conflict of interest, and OGE has to determine that there is, in order to even be eligible for a certificate," Fox said. This is done so that executive branch officials cannot take advantage of the tax deferment unless necessary for ethics purposes. O'Malley said Short's certificate was not approved. Not receiving a certificate of divestiture is not a permissible reason under the law to avoid divesting from stock. In fact, regulations require an employee requesting a certificate to commit in advance to divesting, whether or not OGE grants the request. "Seeking a certificate of divestiture is not seeking approval. It's seeking a tax break," Shaub said. "The nonissuance of a certificate of divestiture does not prevent you from divesting. It prevents you from getting a tax break." Short's application for a certificate of divestiture was not rejected because he was deemed to not have a conflict. The ethics office rejected his application because some of his stocks are held in trusts that would be difficult to divest from. Some of Short's holdings were in trusts created to benefit family members, and OGE would not grant tax breaks for Short unless all potentially conflicting holdings were divested. "OGE would not grant a certificate of divestiture covering individual equities because, after such a divestment, the stocks held in irrevocable generation-skipping trusts — established for the benefit of his children over which Mr. Short has no independent control — would remain," O'Malley said. The Office of the Vice President did not provide a statement on why Short has not divested potentially conflicting stocks outside the trusts. Without a certificate of divestiture, Short would not qualify to defer capital gains taxes on sales of his stocks, and would be forced to pay these taxes. Former ethics officials say that difficulty divesting does not excuse an employee from complying with the conflict of interest law. "Ultimately, the responsibility is on the public official to take all necessary steps to make sure they're either free from potential conflicts of interest or to stay away from any issues that could conflict with those personal financial interests," said Fox. The Office of Government Ethics declined to comment on Short's situation. "OGE is committed to transparency and citizen oversight of government. However, OGE does not respond to questions about specific individuals," said spokesperson Patrick Shepherd. Both of Short's predecessors as chief of staff to Pence — Nick Ayers and Joshua Pitcock — requested and obtained certificates of divestiture. Unlike Short, neither Ayers nor Pitcock appear to have held significant numbers of individual stocks during their time in that office, according to their public disclosure records. Short holds dozens of different stocks across a wide variety of sectors. Other high-ranking officials have divested their stock holdings despite very complex financial situations. Former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson pledged before entering office to divest from 156 companies he held a financial interest in. In an ethics agreement hammered out before the start of the Trump administration, Tillerson, a former CEO of Exxon Mobil, gave up more than $4.1 million in cash bonuses as well as retiree medical and dental benefits. Fox said that selling individual stocks is often the only way for government officials like Short to resolve potential conflicts. Recusal from possible conflicts of interest is often difficult in a position like Short's because his responsibilities as a member of the White House's senior staff would be diverse and touch on a wide range of topics and sectors. "It's not uncommon for somebody in those positions to essentially divest themselves of all common stock... because you really can't anticipate what kinds of information or what kinds of decisions their principals — their bosses — are going to have to make," Fox said. "If you're going to be in this kind of job, you have to be able to act on anything without having to worry about conflicts of interests or recusals or workarounds." The vice president's office would not point to any specific cases of recusal. Short is the most senior staffer to the vice president, who has headed the coronavirus task force since late February. Short has repeatedly been involved in the White House response to the coronavirus crisis. In the past, Short has set the agenda and sent out the White House Situation Room seating chart for the coronavirus task force meetings, according to an April 11 story by The Washington Post. "We meet every morning at nine o'clock," he told CNBC in March, regarding the coronavirus task force. He answered questions from reporters about the coronavirus on Feb. 4 and March 20. In the latter instance, he cited the work of Honeywell, in which he holds between $50,001 and $100,000 of stock. "We are actually encouraged that the partnership with private sector can meet many of these needs," he said, referring to the logistics of obtaining health care supplies. "As some of you know, Honeywell is wholly retrofitting one of their factories to produce more respirator masks." Credit:  C-SPAN On Fox Business on March 18, he cited 3M, a company in which he owns between $65,002 and $150,000 worth of stock. "A few weeks ago, the vice president took a trip to 3M manufacturing in Minnesota," Short said, referring to The 3M Company as one of the "primary producers" of respirator masks. He also addressed the federal government's coronavirus response on CNBC March 20 and March 24, on Fox News March 19 and March 21, and on CNN March 25. In these television interviews, Short discussed personal protective equipment manufacturing, therapeutic pharmaceuticals, public-private partnerships and negotiations over the coronavirus relief package. Scott Amey, general counsel of the government watchdog group Project on Government Oversight, said Short's work is clearly covered by conflict of interest laws. "There's a potential here that the vice president's chief of staff has a conflict of interest in the fact that he is working on the issues, and participating in meetings, and making presentations to the public based on things he's learned through the pandemic [response] and what's coming into the White House," Amey said. A source familiar with Short's stock holdings said that earlier this month, the Office of Government Ethics reviewed Short's ethics program as it relates to the coronavirus task force with the vice president's legal counsel. "Earlier this month, Mr. Short asked OGE to revisit the issue," the source said. On May 1, the Office of Government Ethics took the unusual step of sending a memo out reminding executive branch ethics officials that stocks can pose a conflict of interest. OGE had no comment on whether the memo was sent out in connection with any case in particular. NPR's Barbara Van Woerkom contributed to this report.

             Because of the pandemic, the Bureau of Land Management held virtual public hearings in April on a proposal to expand oil drilling in Alaska's North Slope. Do public hearings over Zoom unfairly suppress opponents' comments, or allow even more people to engage?   That's just one point of dispute as the Trump administration pushes ahead with some of its most controversial environmental policy changes this spring despite the coronavirus pandemic. November's vote is driving momentum, since policies finalized too late could be overturned more easily should President Trump lose re-election or Democrats gain control of the Senate.  But environmentalists, state regulators and lawmakers say the public is distracted by the coronavirus pandemic.  They've asked the government to hit pause on a host of proposals, with little success so far.  Recently finalized rules include scaling back regulations for fuel efficiency in cars and trucks, air pollution coming from power plants and water pollution in streams and wetlands. The administration is also pushing ahead with a string of more localized policies, such as expanded logging and oil drilling in Alaska.  "It really switched the power dynamic" In April, the Bureau of Land Management canceled in-person meetings and instead held eight Zoom sessions on a plan to develop as many as 250 oil wells in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska.  "It really switched the power dynamic, incredibly, during these hearings, in terms of who had the control," says Nicole Whittington-Evans, Alaska director for Defenders of Wildlife. She complains that one man's microphone was muted as he was providing his opinion. Whittington-Evans acknowledges the man was swearing and probably would have been asked to leave an in-person meeting. But "you can't just, like, hold your hand over somebody's face in a public hearing," she says. During the Zoom sessions many opponents of the drilling plan complained that the hearing format was unfair. You can't just, like, hold your hand over somebody's face in a public hearing. Nicole Whittington-Evans, Alaska director, Defenders of Wildlife, about people being muted during public hearings on Zoom But BLM spokeswoman Lesli Ellis-Wouters says Zoom hearings actually have some big advantages. One meeting drew people from both southeast Alaska and the state's northern edge.  "There's 1,000 miles in between those two communities, and they were able to come to the same meeting," she says. "So we were getting perspectives from people that we traditionally have not heard from before."  BLM says the eight sessions had about 300 unique attendees, plus another 2,000 on Facebook Live, far more people than had attended community meetings before the pandemic.   In March, federal agencies also canceled hearings on a proposal to remove dams to help threatened salmon in the Columbia River Basin. Thirteen members of Congress from the Pacific Northwest asked to extend the comment period. "The current crisis cannot plausibly provide for an environment conducive to robust public comment," they wrote.  The request was not granted, and the comment period is now closed. The Trump administration has also moved ahead with changes that affect state water pollution permits and liquefied natural gas development, in addition to relaxing the Obama-era rules on fuel efficiency and pollution in streams and wetlands.  Sharlett Mena, special assistant to the director of the Washington Department of Ecology, says all this undermines state environmental protections for air and water.  "All of these rules have gone forth with our very vocal objection," she says.  "And they were finalized now, when we're flat-footed and we're worried about our communities. We're worried about recovery."

             Northern Dynasty Vice President Doug Allen pitched the Pebble Mine to potential investors February 28, 2020. "So much going on in the world"  Lindsey Bloom thought she finally had the goods to oppose development of Alaska's Pebble Mine. The Obama administration had blocked the gold and copper mine, saying it would threaten the nation's most valuable salmon fishery, but the Trump administration reversed that.  Bloom discovered a video from a conference in late February, when an executive from Pebble's parent company pitched investors. She considered it proof of what fishermen and environmental groups have been warning – that Pebble is minimizing the scope of its plans.  "One of the ways you ensure you can get a permit is you de-risk it by taking something modest and conservative into the permitting process in the first place. And we did that," Northern Dynasty Vice President Doug Allen says on the video. He went on to say the company expects to get a permit to extract more gold at a later date. Bloom, who works for Commercial Fishermen for Bristol Bay, sent a transcript of the comments to multiple news outlets, expecting to generate headlines. But "I haven't been hearing anything back from reporters," she says. "The airwaves are so crowded right now. So much going on in the world." Pebble spokesman Mike Heatwole declined to be interviewed, but pointed out in an email that the public input period on the mine ended last year.  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is now in the final phase, working with government agencies and tribes before it decides on issuing permits. One of those select agencies is supposed to be the Curyung Tribe, but its leaders say they can't keep up with the Pebble documents or attend the biweekly agency meetings. "All of our tribal focus right now has become COVID and maintaining the health and safety of our people here in Bristol Bay," says administrator Courtenay Carty. Thousands of workers are heading to the area for the annual salmon fishery despite concerns about a possible outbreak of COVID-19.   "We're really disenfranchised at this point in time," Carty says. "To (not) be able to focus on something as important as the Pebble permitting process, that we've dedicated over a decade to, to have it come to decision essentially over summer in the midst of a global pandemic, is unfathomable."  Last month, Pebble changed its preferred transportation route for getting the gold out, prompting more criticism that interested parties are not able to adequately respond.  EPA employees have risen to the test of carrying out their duties during this challenging time, and I applaud all of them. Andrew Wheeler, Environmental Protection Agency administrator  Pushing through rollbacks while easing enforcement At a recent Senate hearing, Environmental Protection Agency administrator Andrew Wheeler defended the flurry of action during the pandemic. "EPA employees have risen to the test of carrying out their duties during this challenging time, and I applaud all of them," Wheeler said. But Democratic Senators criticized Wheeler for making changes that could worsen air pollution, even as the nation grapples with a pandemic from a respiratory disease.  They also questioned his agency's move to relax compliance and monitoring of clean air and water laws during the crisis. Nine states and a dozen environmental groups have sued EPA over the measure, alleging it gives polluters too much leeway.  Wheeler countered that EPA is still carrying out enforcement. And the agency said in a statement that there is "no leniency for those who exhibit an intentional disregard for the law or for accidental releases of oil, hazardous substances, hazardous chemicals, hazardous waste or other pollutants." Still, the move rankles Brett VandenHeuvel, Executive Director of Columbia Riverkeeper in Oregon.  "We're seeing simultaneously that they can't do their jobs to enforce environmental laws, but they can push forward dirty pollution-causing projects," he says. Environmental regulators in Oregon and Washington State say easing federal compliance puts more of the onus on them to make sure industrial facilities are operating properly, even as their own agency budgets are collapsing because of the pandemic's economic fallout. But states are still challenging the administration's rollbacks, most recently with a lawsuit against weaker standards for fuel efficiency in cars and trucks.  Oregon Department of Environmental Quality Director Richard Whitman calls the rule "ill-advised" and says it would set back his state's climate goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from transportation.  "In my mind, this is really about propping up our petroleum industry," Whitman says. Doing that "in the middle of the pandemic, I will say, grates on us."

             Madawaska-Edmundston International Bridge connects Madawaska, Maine and Edmundston, New Brunswick, Canada. With visits from Canadian customers having evaporated, many businesses in Madawaska, including gas stations and convenience stores, have been hit hard. Gary Theriault hops off his motorcycle and walks into the Tastee-Freez, a roadside ice cream and takeout stand just a short hop from the Canadian border, in Madawaska, Maine. As he waits for his milkshake, Theriault peers across the St. John River towards Edmundston, New Brunswick. He says the two communities have long been linked by their heritage and connected economies. "Well, a good example is, my mother was born in Edmundston, which is right across the border," Theriault says. "My father was born in Van Buren. So half my relatives are over there, and the other half are over here. So there's a lot of back-and-forth. Visiting aunts, uncles, grandparents. It was always a back-and-forth with the border." Since the 1970s, the population in Madawaska has fallen to less than 4,000 as the local paper mill has laid off workers. But residents say the town's relationship with its Canadian neighbors has helped keep business alive. Locals say Americans go to Edmundston to see family, gamble at the casino, or get a haircut. Canadians come to Madawaska for the cheaper gas and milk.  But most of those visits came to a halt in March, when the U.S. and Canada blocked nonessential travel across the border, temporarily separating many of the cultural, historic and economic ties linking many border communities. Theriault says he can still cross to get parts for his garage door businesses. But other travel, like to see family, has stopped. "So I was crossing every day. I was residing there, and working here," he says. "Then when the decision came, that they were closing the borders, because my business is probably 95% in the states, we made the decision at that time to stay here until things can iron themselves out." Many businesses in Madawaska, including gas stations and convenience stores, were hit hard when visits from Canadian customers evaporated. "Probably 60% of my business is Canadians. So when they closed the bridge down...we let our workers go," says Tim Lausier, a part-owner of Bob's Service Center, a gas station about a mile from the border crossing. "So it's just my sister and I working the store now. And it's been like that for two months. And it looks like it's going to be like that for another month. And I've lost, probably, 2,500 people coming through the door a week." Lausier says he understands the need to maintain restrictions and protect public health. But he worries that even if the border does reopen soon, "people are going to be scared to come over here," he says. "I don't think it'll be back to normal. It might take five or six years, I think." The concerns have led some local business owners — and even a state legislator in Maine — to push for the federal government to reopen parts of the border. But federal officials have said the border will remain closed to non-essential travel until at least June 22nd, and won't be permitted until the administration is "convinced that doing so is safe and secure."Check the hashtag #quaranzine on social media and you'll see thousands of mini books — called zines — that people are making to document their lives in the pandemic.

             President Trump and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He signed a preliminary trade agreement at the White House on Jan. 15. Since then, tensions between the two countries have grown. President Trump is warning of possible sanctions this week against China over its treatment of Hong Kong. It's the latest source of friction in what's become an increasingly tense relationship between the world's two biggest economies.  Things have gone downhill fast in the four months since the two countries signed a preliminary trade deal in which China promised to buy hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of additional American goods.  "We're delighted that the Chinese consumers will now enjoy the greater access to the best products on Earth — those made, grown and raised right here in the USA," Trump said in January.  Hog farmers were among those who saw a big market. China has lost much of its own pork production to an outbreak of African swine fever. "What that's done is created a tremendous opportunity for the pork industry around the world," said Maria Zieba, director of international affairs for the National Pork Producers Council. "Unfortunately, when the Chinese have the chance to buy pork, they're going to go where the price is lowest." Despite the trade deal, American pork still faces an extra 25% tariff in China compared to its global competitors. While pork exports have increased this year, Zieba says they still fall well short of their potential. Exports of farm goods, factory products and crude oil are all running far behind what was promised in the trade deal, according to a tally from the Peterson Institute for International Economics.   Economist Mary Lovely of Syracuse University says those targets were always going to be a stretch. And the coronavirus pandemic has made things worse.  "The world has changed," Lovely says. "And clearly, China's purchases are going to be affected. One, because their demand collapsed; secondly, because American supply collapsed. So you had sort of a double whammy on their reaching these purchase targets."  Last week, Foreign Policy magazine ran a story headlined, "Trump's China Trade Deal Is as Dead as Can Be." White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow insists the deal is still alive, but not as important to the president as it once was.  "Right now, there's been a lot of miscues from China," Kudlow told Fox Business.   Trump has been harshly critical of China over its handling of the pandemic. China was slow to acknowledge that the coronavirus can spread from person to person. Still, China appears to have been much more successful than the United States at controlling the outbreak. Yun Sun, who directs the China program at the Stimson Center, says Beijing reads Trump's criticism as an effort to deflect from his own government's missteps.  "I think the Chinese reaction is, 'Wait a minute. Maybe we are responsible for part of it. But for you to blame everything on us, that's not fair,' " Sun says.  Historically, China has been cautious about flexing its muscle in Hong Kong or making other aggressive moves because it wanted to maintain a working relationship with the U.S. But with both countries now throwing sharp elbows, the brakes are coming off.  "In my view, the pandemic is really just an accelerant of the downward spiral in the relationship, which now appears to me to be almost in free-fall," said Bonnie Glaser, who directs the China Power Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. "I don't know where the bottom is but I feel like we haven't reached it yet."  The Trump administration has been ratcheting up its restrictions on exports of sensitive technology to China. And its calls for reduced dependence on China for critical goods such as medical supplies are growing louder.  Glaser warns that there's so much anti-China sentiment in the U.S., the relationship may suffer even if there's a new president in the White House next year.  "Both [presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe] Biden and Trump are trying to position themselves as being the toughest on China. And nobody is talking about what in this U.S.-China relationship needs to be preserved," Glaser says.  That's ominous for the kind of cooperation between the two countries the world needs to tackle challenges like climate change and the pandemic.

             Cory Obenour, chef and co-owner of the Blue Plate restaurant in San Francisco, prepares takeout and delivery orders. The restaurant received funds from the Paycheck Protection Program, according to The Associated Press. When the federal small business rescue program was announced, Krista Kern-Desjarlais scrambled to research it, talking to her banker and digging online. Kern-Desjarlais runs two restaurants in Maine — the Purple House in North Yarmouth and Bresca & the Honeybee, a summer-only food stand on Sabbathday Lake. She decided to hold off on that coronavirus rescue effort, called the Paycheck Protection Program or PPP. "Right at the last moment, I was like, 'I don't understand enough about this, so I'm not going to do it. I'm going to wait for the next round,' because I felt at that time there has to be a next round," she said. "It's going too fast. " Over time, the Small Business Administration further clarified how the loans will work. As she learned more, Kern-Desjarlais became convinced that the PPP wasn't for her — in part because she wasn't sure when she'd be able to even bring her workers back. "I would have pulled my people off of unemployment, paid them through the PPP as unemployment, and then put them back on unemployment. So it just seemed like an exercise in futility for my situation," she said. In addition, she decided that taking on more debt, along with the two-year payback period, simply didn't work for her businesses. "I think the program is great for a ton of businesses out there that are not restaurants," she said. "We don't have a lot of income, and we have almost nonexistent profit margins. The idea of holding money after [the loan], rather than having it amortized over four or five years, and then having that quick payback period, even though it wasn't a lot of money, it just felt like I'm just leaving my hole deeper." There was a mad dash for the first round of PPP money, which was $349 billion and was gone in 13 days. This second round, $310 billion, is going much more slowly and still has more than $140 billion left one month later. Business owners who wanted the money have, in large part, received it. Others, like Kern-Desjarlais, have decided it's just not for them. Most businesses who wanted the money have gotten it Data from the Census Bureau show that PPP funding is finally catching up to demand. The bureau's Small Business Pulse survey has three weeks of data, starting on April 26 — the week the second round of PPP money opened. Over all three weeks, demand for PPP money didn't rise. Each week, about 75% of businesses said they had requested PPP money since the program opened. But the share of businesses who had received the money rose steadily, from 38% in the first week to nearly 67% in the third week. So while there are still some businesses waiting on funds, it appears that the overwhelming majority that wanted PPP money have gotten it. 
                A survey finds that three-quarters of small businesses report applying for PPP, and two-thirds report receiving the money.

                hide caption
             Beyond that, demand does not appear to be growing. "I think the story that this kind of leads to is that small businesses were really on the ball and applying for this program early on, recognizing that it was first come, first served," said Curtis Long, chief economist at the National Association of Federally-Insured Credit Unions. There was a crush of applications when the program opened on April 3. But many factors — including continually shifting guidance, changing forms, technical difficulties, and many banks only opening up the process to their existing customers — slowed down the lending process and prevented some businesses from receiving the money. To Long, the data show that those issues have improved. "I think the delays that we've seen in funding have just been sort of those bottlenecks, you know, working through those," he said. "It seems like most of those issues have been resolved now." Loan size is smaller Another factor related to the slower PPP usage is smaller loans. At the end of the first round of PPP funding, average loan size was at $206,000. As of May 26, it had dropped to around $115,000. For one thing, some of the very smallest businesses were not allowed to get into the program until later. While the PPP's first round opened on April 3, independent contractors and freelancers weren't allowed to apply until April 10. "By then, there was a huge queue for the portal [where lenders submit PPP applications]," Long said. "So, you know, for that class of borrower, they may have just gotten pushed to Round 2." Funding for the first round ran out on April 16, just six days after those one-person businesses were first allowed to apply. But beyond that, banks may have prioritized their biggest customers. Lawsuits in New York and California have alleged that big banks pushed larger businesses to the front of the PPP line. In addition, The New York Times has reported that JPMorgan Chase gave some of its bigger business clients special treatment in applying for the PPP. Some businesses fear PPP consequences Some business owners like Kern-Desjarlais have decided that the PPP just doesn't work with their finances. The restrictions surrounding how the money must be spent — for example, that it must be spent in eight weeks, with 75% spent on payroll in order to be forgiven — have frustrated some business owners. Some others have been scared off by uncertainty in the program's rules. The PPP application form asks applicants to certify that "current economic uncertainty makes this loan request necessary" for the business to keep operating. Accountant Scott Levine, of Atlanta's Intown Financial Services, says that while many of his applicants are hurting financially, they are nervous about whether they meet that requirement. In addition, he says, some clients' banks warned them strenuously about the dangers of misrepresenting their financial situations. "That scared a lot of my clients, even the ones that were ideally suited to get the loan. They're now scared," he said. "And then there are a couple of articles about people going to jail for fraud, which shouldn't scare them. But it does." This fear is despite the fact that the SBA has clarified that borrowers receiving loans of under $2 million will automatically be deemed to have received the money "in good faith." In addition, uncertainty around exactly how forgiveness will work has led some of Levine's clients to be less enthusiastic about the program. "I tell them, 'You're a poster child for this program. Spend the money,' " he said. "But then I have to tell them, 'I can't guarantee it's gonna be forgiven either.' "

             A mostly empty highway through downtown Los Angeles on April 7. An NPR analysis of a key air pollutant showed levels have not changed dramatically since the pandemic curbed car traffic in the U.S. NPR science reporter Rebecca Hersher and NPR climate correspondent Lauren Sommer explain why — and what really makes our air dirty. Here's their story.Email the show at shortwave@npr.org. This episode was produced by Brent Baughman, edited by Viet Le, and fact-checked by Emily Vaughn. My (Anya's) house is full of little reminders of Aunt Nancy. When she was diagnosed with ovarian cancer two years ago, she was so unflinching about what that meant, so clear about how to use her remaining time. She made plans to see her grandnieces in between treatments, and she passed along little items sure to delight them, like a gilded old mustard tin full of embroidery thread, beads and other saved-up treasures.  At the end of April, we got word she was on home hospice care. We planned a last visit. Times being what they are, it took place over Zoom. Nancy sat up in bed, glasses looking owlish on her gaunt face. There was everything and nothing to say. Then my 3-year-old proposed a cuddle. On opposite sides of the screen, we merged into one family hug.  A week later she was gone.  The Jewish rituals of mourning are premised on presence. You show up, bearing food, to bring comfort when words are no good. We drove to my mother-in-law's house — Nancy's big sister — for the first time since the lockdown began, setting our gifts of baked pasta, cookies and challah in the garage. We sat on the lawn, 6 feet apart, wearing masks. The girls played in the garden.  The United States has marked the horrible milestone of over 100,000 deaths from the coronavirus. How do we find the words to confront this kind of loss? How do we help our children do the same, especially without access to the kinds of rituals and gatherings that may have given comfort in the past?  Back in 1983, the show Sesame Street offered some help in what would become one of the show's most famous episodes. It was broadcast on Thanksgiving Day, when show executives knew grown-ups would be home watching with their kids.  The show's writers were responding to the real-life death of Will Lee, the actor who played Mr. Hooper, the grandfatherly figure who ran Sesame's corner store. They could have written his character a happy ending, but they decided to confront the truth head-on. "Mr. Hooper's not coming back," one of the adult cast members, Susan, told Big Bird. All the adults were there, gathered in a semicircle. "Why not?" Big Bird asked. "Big Bird, when people die, they don't come back," Susan told him. "Ever?" "No. Never." "Well," Big Bird said, his voice fluttering with fear and confusion, "why not?" What followed is a master class in how to talk with young children about death.  We revisited that episode with Rosemarie Truglio, a developmental psychologist and the senior vice president of curriculum and content at Sesame Workshop, and together we distilled it to a handful of useful takeaways for parents. When it comes to describing the what of death to kids — what exactly happens to our bodies and what that means — Truglio says it's important to be straightforward. That's because children often struggle to grasp death's permanence. And parents only complicate matters when they resort to euphemisms. In fairness, we do this to soften the blow for kids, but Truglio says euphemisms can confuse and even scare children "Passed away. We're sorry for your loss. Went on a long, long journey." Truglio says each of these phrases sends the wrong message to kids. The dead don't pass, get lost or pack a bag and start walking. Especially problematic are the words parents often use, as mine (Cory's) did, when a pet is euthanized. "We put the dog to sleep. That's a really big one," Truglio says, explaining that this is how kids hear those words: "If you're telling me now that the dog went to sleep and is not going to wake up and died, well, I go to sleep every night. Am I going to die?" Instead, Truglio says, be perfectly clear: "When you die, your heart stops. Your body stops working. You don't eat. You don't breathe — to give more concrete information about what is the meaning of death," Truglio says. Kids process death in bits and pieces, over time, Truglio says. Don't sit them down once, overwhelm them with information and expect them to internalize it all. Parenting a child through death requires patience and persistence. You may explain, clearly and in concrete terms, that Grandma has died and, three days later, be asked, "When's Grandma coming back?" Truglio says a hospice social worker who specialized in talking with children about death once likened this process to the way a child eats an apple: "They take a bite, maybe two bites, then put it down," Truglio says. "That's probably how they're going to experience death as well. They're gonna take a couple of bites. They're gonna go on with their lives. And then they're gonna come back, and they're gonna take a couple more bites." Often, the death of a loved one can be destabilizing for a child, not simply because that person will no longer be in their lives but because it can stir deep fears of being alone or abandoned. That's why, Truglio says, when a child is mourning, make sure the child knows "that there are many people in their lives — there are grandparents, there are aunts, there are uncles, there are some really, really good friends who are like family." In short, Truglio says, kids need to be reassured: "You will always be cared for." One of the most powerful moments in Sesame Street's half-century history came as actor Bob McGrath, who played a music teacher on the show, took his turn consoling Big Bird. "You're right, Big Bird. It'll never be the same around here without [Mr. Hooper]. But you know something?" McGrath said through tears, his voice halting. "We can all be very happy that we had a chance to be with him and to know him and to love him a lot when he was here." It was a remarkably tender and honest display of emotion between an adult — who was, in fact, mourning his friend and colleague — and the childlike Big Bird. And this, Truglio says, sent a powerful message to parents and kids alike. "It's important for children to see us grieve," Truglio says. "We're gonna cry, and I think that you need to explain why you're crying. This isn't gonna be just a one-time event." That's especially true if you, the parent, are mourning the death of someone close to you. This will be a long process. Showing emotion and explaining the feelings that underlie those emotions help prepare children for future moments when you may, again, feel overwhelmed by grief. For the time being, many funerals are being postponed or held online or are limited to immediate family members. This may make it easier for parents who struggle with whether to bring children. When it comes to funerals, Sesame's Truglio has this advice: Give kids a choice. "You should never say, 'You have to do this,' or make them feel guilty if they choose not to participate," Truglio says. "You need to give them that wiggle room. You can't force them." But tell them what to expect, whatever they choose. So, if you're going to a funeral with an open casket, explain what that will mean. Again, be clear and concrete. Then let the child decide if she thinks she's ready for that. In my (Anya's) family, a rabbi came to my mother-in-law's yard to say a few words while a few dozen mourners watched on Zoom from different parts of the country. The girls were able to join for about 20 minutes, and when they got fidgety, we simply urged them off camera.  Finally, Truglio says, it's important to convey to your child that "life is going to go on. We're going to be OK. It's a tough time right now, but we have things to look forward to." One activity she recommends is having your child trace her hand on a sheet of paper and, for each finger, ask her to list something that she's looking forward to. It could be camping in the backyard or baking a favorite dessert. The point, Truglio says, is to keep the hope alive. The folks at Sesame Street did this beautifully with Big Bird. At the end of the emotional Mr. Hooper episode, Big Bird sits quietly in his oversize nest. Suddenly, he's visited by the show's grown-ups, who introduce him to a new baby on the street. Big Bird is thrilled by the visit, fawns over the baby and then drops this famously hopeful last line: "Gee, you know what the nice thing is about new babies?" Big Bird asks. "One day they're not here, and the next day, here they are!"

             Labourers wearing facemasks work in a garment factory during a government-imposed lockdown as a preventive measure against the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus in Dhaka on May 2. According to Johns Hopkins University, more than 100,000 people have died in the United States from COVID-19, and experts at the World Health Organization warn a second peak of COVID-19 infections could occur during this first wave of the virus. Meanwhile, the global race for a vaccine is generating competition between nations, mainly the U.S. and China. New numbers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reveal more than 60,000 health care workers have been infected with COVID-19, and almost 300 have died. This is a dramatic increase since the CDC first released numbers six weeks ago. Bangladesh has extended its coronavirus lockdown  — except for the garment factories. But with big brands canceling orders, workers face pay cuts, hunger and little to no social distancing.

             A volunteer artist sets up a memorial May 20 in Brooklyn. Artists and volunteer organizers across New York City put up memorials throughout the five boroughs to honor those who died of COVID-19. The U.S. death toll from COVID-19 has reached a somber milestone: As of Wednesday afternoon, the highly infectious viral disease has taken more than 100,000 lives nationwide. Soaring from two known coronavirus fatalities in February to more than 58,000 in April, the tally of U.S. deaths — in a country with fewer than 5% of the world's inhabitants — now accounts for nearly one-third of all the known lives lost worldwide to the pandemic. According to a mortality analysis by Johns Hopkins University's Coronavirus Resource Center, about 6% of the nearly 1.7 million people who have tested positive for the coronavirus in the U.S. have succumbed to the disease.  Public health experts said the coronavirus has exposed the vulnerability of a wide range of Americans and the shortcomings of a U.S. health care system faced with a deadly pandemic.  "What is different about this is, it is affecting all of us in a variety of ways, even if some of us are able to social distance in more effective ways than others," said sociology professor Kathleen Cagney, who directs the University of Chicago's Population Research Center. "But we all feel at risk." Even some who are well-acquainted with earlier health scourges in the U.S. were caught off guard by this one.  "I think anybody who understands anything about infectious disease recognizes that we were going to sooner or later face something like this," said John Barry, a professor at Tulane University School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine and author of The Great Influenza: The Story of the Deadliest Pandemic in History, on NPR's Fresh Air earlier this month. "But, you know, intellectually understanding it is one thing, and having it hit you is something quite different." Demographic disparities in deaths People have died from the disease in all 50 states and most U.S. territories. But the impact has been felt unevenly. Demographic statistics that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has posted of the first nearly 69,000 fatalities show some striking disparities: — The disease has been far deadlier for males than females. For age groups up to 75 years old, about twice as many men and boys have been killed by COVID-19 as have women and girls.  — Older people have died in much greater numbers than those who are younger. Eighty percent of the known fatalities were at least 65.  — Racial and ethnic disparities in who is dying have also become apparent, even while tracking data that Johns Hopkins has compiled remain incomplete.  In Alabama, for example, 44% of those killed by COVID-19 were black in a state where fewer than 27% of its residents are African American. Similarly, while African Americans make up 14% of Michigan's population, they account for 40% of that state's COVID-19 fatalities.

             Nurses and health care workers mourn colleagues who died during the pandemic at a demonstration in April outside Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. Native American communities have also been hit especially hard by the pandemic. In Arizona, Native Americans account for about 5% of the population but make up nearly 17% of that state's COVID-19 fatalities. The University of Chicago's Cagney said that differences in socioeconomic status — and thus the ability to practice social distancing — are contributing to COVID-19's uneven lethal impact. "If you look at the locations where people are disproportionately dying, they are in places that are lower income," Cagney said. "They are places that likely have multiple residents in a single-unit space. They are places where people rely on public transit and rely on services like big-box locations, where by entry alone you're putting yourself at risk." The degree of devastation wrought by the pathogen has taken even some public health experts by surprise. "Back in March, I did not think this would be possible — I was not expecting 100,000 deaths," said Christopher Murray, director of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington. "I really believed we as a nation would have taken the decision to put in place social distancing and accepted the economic hardship that it's creating, and that we would have stuck to it to get transmission down to a very low level." A study done this month by a Columbia University research team suggests the number of coronavirus deaths in the U.S. could have been considerably lower had Americans been told sooner to stay home and maintain social distancing. A "pre-print" version of the report — meaning it has yet to be peer-reviewed — finds that "55% of reported deaths as of May 3, 2020, could have been avoided if the same control measures had been implemented just one week earlier." By that measure, the nationwide death toll on that date of 65,307 could have instead stood at 29,410 — meaning nearly 36,000 lives might have been saved. "The lesson isn't what this means for the next time we have a pandemic with a new virus," said Jeffrey Shaman, one of the study's co-authors. "The lesson is really what are we doing with this virus as we move forward that it isn't going anywhere and that we still have to contend with it." Asked about the Columbia University study, President Trump dismissed it last week as "just a political hit job." A roller-coaster ride of presidential predictions The number of Americans killed by the pandemic appears to be a sensitive subject for a president seeking reelection in November. His predictions have gone up and down several times. "We have it totally under control. It's one person coming in from China," Trump told CNBC on Jan. 22, one day after the CDC confirmed the first COVID-19 case in the United States. "We have it under control. It's going to be just fine."

             President Trump speaks to reporters May 19 after meeting with Senate Republicans at their weekly luncheon on Capitol Hill. Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell stand at Trump's side. Five weeks later, on Feb. 27 — almost a month after the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a "public health emergency of international concern" — Trump continued to downplay the threat posed by the coronavirus."You have 15 people, and the 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero," Trump declared at a White House coronavirus task force briefing. "That's a pretty good job we've done." But the numbers kept rising. By the end of March, with the WHO having already declared a global pandemic, Johns Hopkins was reporting more than 188,000 confirmed coronavirus infections in the U.S. and some 5,500 deaths.  That was when Trump executed an abrupt U-turn in his effort to manage public expectations: For the first time, he broached the possibility that the pandemic — far from nearing zero — could indeed end up claiming 100,000 U.S. lives.  Speaking from the White House Rose Garden on March 29, Trump cited new mortality projections by Dr. Deborah Birx, response coordinator for the White House coronavirus task force, and Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. The two had predicted that if no preventive measures were taken, the pandemic could cause 2.2 million deaths in the U.S.; if such measures were taken, the toll could be between 100,000 and 200,000 deaths over an unspecified period of time. "And so, if we can hold that down, as we're saying, to 100,000 — that's a horrible number — maybe even less, but to 100,000," Trump said, "so we have between 100- and 200,000 — we all, together, have done a very good job." Three weeks later, amid mounting pressure from supporters to reopen the economy, Trump was back to lowering public expectations about how many lives the pandemic might claim. "One is too many. But we're going toward 50- or 60,000 people," Trump declared on April 20. "That's at the lower — as you know, the low number was supposed to be 100,000 people. We — we could end up at 50 to 60."  Trump appeared to be relying on one of the lowest of a dozen fatality estimates at the time, a range of 60,000 to 115,000 deaths modeled by the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation.

             Family and friends lay flowers on the casket of Bishop Carl Williams Jr. last week at Hollywood Memorial Park and Cemetery in Union, N.J. Only a few family members were permitted to attend the service in person due to the pandemic. But a week later, with social distancing measures being eased, the institute practically doubled those projected numbers, forecasting that nearly 135,000 — and possibly as many as 242,890 — people would die by August in the U.S. from COVID-19. The institute's Murray said the earlier calculations had been made assuming every state would hold off on loosening social distancing measures until new infections had dropped to a very low level. "But even before people started relaxing the mandates, people start changing their behavior as the national discussion about reopening the economy became pretty dominant," said Murray, adding that his team realized keeping those mandates in place until early June "was just not going to happen. And so that's what led to our major change in the modeling's strategy and assumptions." Trump, for his part, once again raised his predictions about how many lives in the U.S. the pandemic would claim. "I used to say 65,000," he declared May 3 during a Fox News interview held at the Lincoln Memorial. "And now I'm saying 80 or 90, and it goes up and it goes up rapidly. But it's still going to be, no matter how you look at it, at the very lower end of the plane." By mid-May, all of the dozen forecasting models for COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. tracked by the CDC surpassed Trump's latest predictions. "All forecast an increase in deaths in the coming weeks," CDC Director Robert Redfield, in his first public comment on expected deaths, tweeted on May 15. Every one of those models, he added, predicted "a cumulative total exceeding 100,000 by June 1." Many more deaths expected — and funerals With all 50 states now separately dropping some or all of their social distancing restrictions, health experts warn that the U.S. coronavirus death toll could climb much higher than the approximately 140,000 by August that many of them have been predicting.

             A man sets a candle outside the Otay Mesa Detention Center during a "Vigil for Carlos" on May 9 in San Diego. The vigil was held to commemorate Carlos Ernesto Escobar Mejia, who died of COVID-19-related symptoms at the detention center. "Now we're almost getting the worst of both worlds — we're getting the economic hardship and we're relaxing," Murray said. "And it seems either now or in the fall, we're going to have a big second wave, and we'll be right back to dealing with pressure on the hospital system and dealing with, when is the peak surge coming?" Columbia University's Shaman said the U.S. has to keep suppressing the spread of COVID-19 while having an acceptable level of a functioning economy. "That's the hard problem we're trying to address as we try to figure that out and we loosen restrictions," Shaman said. "If we have these flare-ups, we have to be willing to immediately recognize them and tamp back down and not wait and not dither. And that goes both for communities that have experienced the virus already and those that have not experienced it as much." And there's another challenge: Many of the 100,000 who have died have not yet had proper send-offs. "It's been stunning to me that we have had as much death as we've had, with as little attention to all those deaths," said Dr. Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute. "I think one of the reasons we've had so little attention to all of this is because we've not had the kind of public mourning that comes with mass casualties like this." Jha said he expects that as the U.S. opens up from its social isolation, those who have grieved privately will be holding postponed funerals, burials and other commemorations. "I think the sort of the weight of this calamity is going to become much more apparent to people in the upcoming days and weeks," Jha added. "So people are going to, I think, really come to grips with how awful these last couple of months have been."We are living through a historical moment that is so big, in so many ways. The response should be equally big. What might've seemed absurd just a few months ago is what we need to be trying right now. Yes, we need to dramatically increase testing and hire an army of contact tracers — but that's not going to be enough. We need to think bigger. We need to think weirder. So, in this episode, we look at three big ideas: building useless factories for a good reason, handing out money to almost everyone based on the unemployment rate, and quarantining an entire sports league.

             House Minority Leader Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., speaks during a news conference outside the U.S. Capitol about lawsuit he and other Republican leaders filed  against House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and congressional officials in an effort to block the House of Representatives from using a proxy voting system to allow for remote voting during the coronavirus pandemic. Updated at 5:30 p.m. ET  The pressure is on for Arizona Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego.  For the first time, he traveled to Washington, D.C. with elaborate instructions to vote on behalf of two of his colleagues. Gallego can do this under historic new rules allowing proxy voting.  So for two days of legislative floor action, Gallego will call his colleagues — Democratic Reps. Nanette Diaz  Barragán of California and Filemon Vela of Texas — before every vote, amendment and other key developments. "I'm just going to make sure that I double check and triple check their phone calls, emails and texts and then I'll double check with the clerk as I'm voting for them,"  Gallego says with a laugh. "I don't want to mess this up for them, I want to make sure I do it right and try to not at least not embarrass myself."   One by one, Gallego and other members lined up on the House floor to announce their colleagues' intentions during the first vote series on Wednesday. It was for approval of a human rights policy bill urging protection of the Uighurs, a predominantly Muslim ethnic group in China. The measure was easily approved 413-1. In all, more than 70 members submitted noticed to the House clerk's office that a colleague would vote on their behalf.  All are Democrats and the issue has become a partisan flashpoint about whether the House should reopen for business as usual as states around the country are taking steps to get people back to work. Earlier this month, the House approved new rules allowing remote voting and hearings for the first time in the chamber's history. Now, a member can vote on behalf of up to 10 colleagues who are unable to travel to the Capitol during the coronavirus pandemic. Some Democrats closer to Washington, D.C., including Reps. Don Beyer of Virginia and Jamie Raskin of Maryland, were in even higher demand with plans to vote on behalf of five of their colleagues or more.  It marks the most significant change to the way the House votes since it allowed electronic voting on the House floor in 1973. The new rules were adopted on May 15 along a straight party line vote.  The change was spurred along by the worsening pandemic, which forced the House to extend its recess in the midst of an outbreak on Capitol Hill and as public health risks were assessed. The chamber has only held a handful of votes related to coronavirus legislation in the last two months. Texas Democratic Rep. Vicente Gonzalez, who voted by proxy, defended the practice. Gonzalez seriously injured his back earlier this month when he fell 12 feet while working on his home, and now has to recuperate for several weeks. He designated a member in his state's delegation, Rep. Henry Cuellar, to vote on his behalf this week.   "In times of crisis, our nation must adapt. It's past time we modernized Congress' voting system to allow for remote voting during national emergencies," Gonzalez said. "Proxy voting allows for Members of Congress to continue working for the people while following the advice of medical professionals to limit the spread of COVID-19. This solution allows me to represent the people of my district and vote on their behalf despite my recent injuries." However, Republicans have argued proxy voting bucks the chamber's 231-year institutional history and sets a dangerous precedent. Late Tuesday, they filed a federal lawsuit to stop the plan on grounds it was unconstitutional.  "That is why I stand with the members behind me and the constituents across this country in upholding the Constitution, exactly what we swore we would do," said House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., while flanked by Reps. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, Steve Scalise of Louisiana and other members, at a morning news conference criticizing Democratic leaders.  McCarthy, Cheney and Scalise are among more than 20 Republican House members and four constituents listed as plaintiffs in the suit against House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other officials. Late Tuesday, Pelosi called the move a "sad stunt."   Cheney had previously touted the concept of remote voting, but says she's not on board now because Democrats installed it without bipartisan support.  "There are ways that we can work together, as I said, many of us have been public about wanting to do that," she said. But "this is not a time for partisanship. It's not a time to try to take partisan advantage of a crisis."  The House was slated to consider more than a half dozen bills Wednesday and Thursday, including a measure on reforming a popular small business loan program during the pandemic.  Also on Wednesday, the House Rules Committee held the chamber's first remote hearing via video conference. It was beset with its own challenges, with muting issues and other technical difficulties as some members gave their presentations. "There's really no excuse to not gather in the same room," an obviously frustrated Rep. Warren Davidson, R-Ohio, said during the meeting. "And frankly, it's the United States Congress, so if we need to rent out a freaking stadium, then we should be able to rent a stadium and operate." Under the new rules, committees must hold a virtual practice session, followed by two remote hearings. Once those steps are completed, a panel can hold a markup by video conference as well. For now, committees are directed to use Cisco Webex to connect.  Later Wednesday, Republicans on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, led by ranking member Jim Jordan of Ohio, threatened to boycott their future virtual hearings. They documented grievances of "quasi-hearings" by video conference and technical glitches in a letter to the panel's chair, Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y. "Beyond the unprecedented nature of operating the House in this manner, it is unworkable from a day to day perspective," the letter said. 
                Breathing slowly and deeply through the nose is associated with a relaxation response, says James Nestor, author of Breath. As the diaphragm lowers, you're allowing more air into your lungs and your body switches to a more relaxed state.

             Breathing slowly and deeply through the nose is associated with a relaxation response, says James Nestor, author of Breath. As the diaphragm lowers, you're allowing more air into your lungs and your body switches to a more relaxed state. Humans typically take about 25,000 breaths per day — often without a second thought. But the COVID-19 pandemic has put a new spotlight on respiratory illnesses and the breaths we so often take for granted. Journalist James Nestor became interested in the respiratory system years ago after his doctor recommended he take a breathing class to help his recurring pneumonia and bronchitis. While researching the science and culture of breathing for his new book, Breath: The New Science of a Lost Art, Nestor participated in a study in which his nose was completely plugged for 10 days, forcing him to breathe solely through his mouth. It was not a pleasant experience. "I went from snoring a couple minutes a night to, within three days, I was snoring four hours a night," he says of the forced mouth-breathing. "I developed sleep apnea. My stress levels were off the charts. My nervous system was a mess. ... I felt awful." The New Science of a Lost Art by James Nestor Hardcover, 280 pages | Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How? Nestor says the researchers he's talked to recommend taking time to "consciously listen to yourself and [to] feel how breath is affecting you." He notes taking "slow and low" breaths through the nose can help relieve stress and reduce blood pressure. "This is the way your body wants to take in air," Nestor says. "It lowers the burden of the heart if we breathe properly and if we really engage the diaphragm." On why nose breathing is better than mouth breathing  The nose filters, heats and treats raw air. Most of us know that. But so many of us don't realize — at least I didn't realize — how [inhaling through the nose] can trigger different hormones to flood into our bodies, how it can lower our blood pressure ... how it monitors heart rate ... even helps store memories. So it's this incredible organ that ... orchestrates innumerable functions in our body to keep us balanced. On how the nose has erectile tissue The nose is more closely connected to our genitals than any other organ. It is covered in that same tissue. So when one area gets stimulated, the nose will become stimulated as well. Some people have too close of a connection where they get stimulated in the southerly regions, they will start uncontrollably sneezing. And this condition is common enough that it was given a name called honeymoon rhinitis.

             James Nestor's previous book, Deep, focused on the science behind free diving. Another thing that is really fascinating is that erectile tissue will pulse on its own. So it will close one nostril and allow breath in through the other nostril, then that other nostril will close and allow breath in. Our bodies do this on their own. ... A lot of people who've studied this believe that this is the way that our bodies maintain balance, because when we breathe through our right nostril, circulation speeds up [and] the body gets hotter, cortisol levels increase, blood pressure increases. So breathing through the left will relax us more. So blood pressure will decrease, [it] lowers temperature, cools the body, reduces anxiety as well. So our bodies are naturally doing this. And when we breathe through our mouths, we're denying our bodies the ability to do this. On how breath affects anxiety I talked to a neuropsychologist ... and he explained to me that people with anxieties or other fear-based conditions typically will breathe way too much. So what happens when you breathe that much is you're constantly putting yourself into a state of stress. So you're stimulating that sympathetic side of the nervous system. And the way to change that is to breathe deeply. Because if you think about it, if you're stressed out [and thinking] a tiger is going to come get you, [or] you're going to get hit by a car, [you] breathe, breathe, breathe as much as you can. But by breathing slowly, that is associated with a relaxation response. So the diaphragm lowers, you're allowing more air into your lungs and your body immediately switches to a relaxed state. On why exhaling helps you relax Because the exhale is a parasympathetic response. Right now, you can put your hand over your heart. If you take a very slow inhale in, you're going to feel your heart speed up. As you exhale, you should be feeling your heart slow down. So exhaling relaxes the body. And something else happens when we take a very deep breath like this. The diaphragm lowers when we take a breath in, and that sucks a bunch of blood — a huge profusion of blood — into the thoracic cavity. As we exhale, that blood shoots back out through the body. On the problem with taking shallow breaths  You can think about breathing as being in a boat, right? So you can take a bunch of very short, stilted strokes and you're going to get to where you want to go. It's going to take a while, but you'll get there. Or you can take a few very fluid and long strokes and get there so much more efficiently. ... You want to make it very easy for your body to get air, especially if this is an act that we're doing 25,000 times a day. So, by just extending those inhales and exhales, by moving that diaphragm up and down a little more, you can have a profound effect on your blood pressure, on your mental state. On how free divers expand their lung capacity to hold their breath for several minutes The world record is 12 1/2 minutes. ... Most divers will hold their breath for eight minutes, seven minutes, which is still incredible to me. When I first saw this, this was several years ago, I was sent out on a reporting assignment to write about a free-diving competition. You watch this person at the surface take a single breath there and completely disappear into the ocean, come back five or six minutes later. ... We've been told that whatever we have, whatever we're born with, is what we're going to have for the rest of our lives, especially as far as the organs are concerned. But we can absolutely affect our lung capacity. So some of these divers have a lung capacity of 14 liters, which is about double the size for a [typical] adult male. They weren't born this way. ... They trained themselves to breathe in ways to profoundly affect their physical bodies. Sam Briger and Joel Wolfram produced and edited this interview for broadcast.

             A new French law requires masks be worn in certain public spaces, but it is still illegal to wear religious attire that covers the face. In 2010, France passed a law prohibiting people from wearing clothing in public that covers your face. And although many blasted the law as Islamophobic, the "burqa ban" remains in place today, punishable with a fine and citizenship course. But as the country begins to emerge from lockdown, wearing masks is mandatory in public places such as schools and on public transport. Shop owners can require customers to wear them as well. And while the government does not see any conflict between the laws - one is to promote gender equality and the other is to maintain public health - the situation has left many, including some French Muslims, smirking at the apparent irony.  In this episode of Rough Translation, we look at how the mask is changing the way people relate to each other in a country where until recently, it was your civic duty to show your face to all.  Further Context:Over the past month, Hong Kong has averaged one new confirmed coronavirus case a day. Taiwan has reported only one case in the past three weeks. The situation is similar in Vietnam. Although the number of coronavirus cases continues to grow globally, there are places that have managed to successfully control COVID-19. New Zealand's triumph Perhaps the greatest success story is New Zealand, which has stopped local transmission and has a plan to completely eliminate the virus from its territory. "The lesson is that it can be done," says Siouxsie Wiles, an associate professor of microbiology in New Zealand. "Obviously, the longer you leave it, and the more cases there are, the harder it becomes. But that doesn't mean that we shouldn't try." Wiles heads up the Bioluminescent Superbugs Lab at the University of Auckland. Much of her work focuses on antibiotic resistance and infectious diseases. When the coronavirus hit, she got involved in communication efforts in New Zealand to help explain the virus, including by using a popular cartoon. But it wasn't just scientists who led the charge. Wiles — and many other New Zealanders — give much of the credit for their country's success to the swift and decisive leadership of Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern in March.

             Jacinda Ardern, the prime minister of New Zealand, briefs the media on COVID-19. She issued a call for New Zealanders to protect one another from the health threat. "Our prime minister made the decision that she did not want what was happening in Italy to happen in New Zealand," Wiles says. In mid-March, as cases were exploding in Italy and Spain, Ardern ordered anyone entering New Zealand into quarantine. At that point, the country had confirmed just six cases. A few days later, on March 19, Ardern shut down travel to the country, essentially banning all foreigners from entering the island nation of 4.8 million. She took to the national airwaves to explain a four-stage lockdown system that New Zealand would use to confront the health crisis. "I'm speaking to all New Zealanders today to give you as much certainty and clarity as we can as we fight COVID-19," she said in a nationally televised address on March 21. Ardern called the threat "unprecedented," but she was calm and reassuring. "Here's how we'll know what to do and when," she said as she laid out plans to shut down schools, most businesses and domestic travel. Wiles at the University of Auckland says that the prime minister did something quite interesting, "which was that unlike many other countries, she never put us on a war footing." So Ardern's speeches weren't about attacking an invisible enemy — as many world leaders would say. Instead she called on New Zealanders to confront this crisis by protecting their fellow citizens. "She talked over and over about us being a team of 5 million and that we all do our part to break these chains of transmission and to eliminate the virus," Wiles says. "I think that has been one of the really crucial things — everybody knowing how they had to behave and that they were behaving for the good of everybody." Wiles heard the prime minister's calls for everyone to come together so many times that she refers to it as Ardern doing her "united thing." New Zealand is now reopening most businesses and is even talking about complete elimination of the coronavirus from its territory. As of late May, New Zealand had had roughly 1,500 cases and fewer than two dozen deaths from COVID-19.  Loading...   Loading...  Outstanding in Asia Several nations in Asia have had far larger outbreaks but have managed to bring the disease under control. For example, South Korea has reported more than 11,000 cases. In late February and early March, South Korea was reporting about 750 new cases a day. Now the country is down to an average just a few dozen per day. Gi-Wook Shin, the head of Walter H. Shorenstein Asia-Pacific Research Center at Stanford University, says the most successful countries all did some things similar to New Zealand. "There are some common threads," Shin says. One is very swift and effective action by the state against the outbreak. Hong Kong, Taiwan, Vietnam and South Korea all either banned incoming visitors early in the outbreak or placed them in two-week quarantines. South Korea quickly developed its own testing system. Many countries in the Asia-Pacific region have experience with the central government being involved in business development, particularly technology development. So they know how to harness their manufacturing and research hubs to attack particular problems. Shin says the faith in government in these countries and the experience of having the state lead economic development in the past helped these countries respond faster to the pandemic. "In those countries in Asia, absolutely, they believe that the state, the central government, is responsible for intervening and then solving this problem," Shin says. Another clear trait of the successful responses against COVID-19 is that they've all been "apolitical." The efforts haven't been framed as coming from one political party or another but rather as efforts for the good of everyone. The successful Asian countries had national plans, and the leaders articulated them to their people. "If you look at like Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam or maybe even Hong Kong," Shin says. "The message from the central government was very clear, very straightforward, very coherent and, I think, very effective." Angela Merkel's TV strategy Countries in other parts of the world have also managed, for various reasons, to tame COVID-19. Many nations in the Caribbean have corralled the virus after it arrived on their shores. In addition, Costa Rica, Iceland and Rwanda have also reduced spread to extremely low levels. Mauritius has only reported two cases since April. In Europe, Germany is still dealing with hundreds of cases a day, but it brought transmission down faster and with far fewer deaths than most other countries in Europe. On March 18, German Chancellor Angela Merkel did something that she had never done before while in office. She took to the airwaves and gave a televised national address. The topic: explaining her plan for how to tackle the coronavirus outbreak. "It is serious," Merkel said of the virus. "Take it seriously." Jana Puglierin, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations in Berlin, says Merkel going on TV to give a speech in a crisis was very unusual for her. "She has never done that in any of the previous crises, not in the migration crisis, not during the eurozone crisis. So this was really a first for her," Puglierin says. As a public speaker, Merkel has a reputation as being cold. "But in this speech, she really managed to connect with the people," Puglierin says. Merkel brought Germans on board to fight the outbreak. She told them that the only way to overcome this crisis was for every German to accept it as their own responsibility to reduce the spread of the virus. "She convinced them that this was necessary," Puglierin says. Merkel added that since the end of World War II and national reunification, there has been no other challenge that depends as strongly on Germans working together. "She was very human, very approachable, very transparent and very clear in her message," Puglierin says. And it also helped that Merkel is a scientist, with a doctorate in quantum chemistry. She understood the science behind the outbreak. "And she has this tremendous gift of explaining everything that is related to that virus in a very clear and understandable way for ordinary citizens." Germany is still dealing with coronavirus transmission but has brought its daily case numbers down significantly. Parts of the country are starting to reopen. Things aren't perfect. Some of the reopening is fairly chaotic. Students are going back to school at different times. "My kids, for example," Puglierin says. "One goes to school once before the summer break starts. The other goes every third day, and the neighbor kid goes every day. So that adds to a lot of frustration." But there's a feeling that things are moving in the right direction. Case numbers in Germany are going down. Millions of students are returning to school. That's the kind of progress that so many people around the world desperately want to see.

             A judge in Baker City, Ore., ruled that Gov. Kate Brown had acted beyond her authority by extending the state's stay-at-home restrictions. A county judge in Oregon has refused to vacate his ruling rejecting that state's stay-at-home order, though Gov. Kate Brown's restrictions will remain in place pending a review by the Oregon Supreme Court. The case is one of several challenges launched recently by conservatives in mostly rural areas from Illinois to Wisconsin to Oregon. They've upended or threatened to upend statewide public health restrictions in place to curb coronavirus infections. They also appear to be bringing the divide between urban and rural areas into sharper focus.  For instance, Baker County, from where Oregon's most recent challenge stemmed, has one confirmed COVID-19 case.  "We have no vile threat that it's going to be expanding around here, so why in God's name are you still holding us to restrictions?" asked Bill Harvey, chair of the Baker County Commission.  Harvey, a Republican, signed onto his state's most recent lawsuit that was originally brought by Oregon churches, including Elkhorn Baptist in Baker City. The judge ruled last week that under state law, the governor must consult the Legislature before extending her emergency restrictions beyond 28 days.  The statewide order is back in place for now pending an appeal. "You don't have the threats you would have in a major city," Harvey said. "You can't judge or control our atmosphere based on what you think the Portland area should be."

             Baker County, Ore., Commissioner Mark Bennett had a cousin from the East Coast who died from the coronavirus. "A rural versus urban issue" Baker County, with a population of about 17,000, is some 300 miles east of the liberal-leaning Portland metro area. Along the old Oregon Trail, tourism is big here. So is cattle ranching. Both have been hammered economically by the shutdown. Summer rodeos, fishing tournaments and fairs are canceled, among other things. "This has become a rural versus urban issue," said Kathy Cramer, a University of Wisconsin-Madison political scientist. Cramer recently wrote a book called The Politics of Resentment, focusing on her state's urban-rural divide. Cramer said there's general mistrust toward government regulations in rural America. And now coronavirus restrictions are being written that look to some like they were crafted only with city folks in mind. "The idea that the government is not attentive enough to the actual challenges of rural communities is not new," Cramer said. "The pandemic seems to have deepened some of the resentment that's been there for a long time."   Oregon's urban-rural divide has long been tense. In eastern Oregon these days, it's not uncommon to see a big Trump 2020 banner on the back of a pickup or even Confederate flags flying in yards. Conservative state lawmakers recently made headlines for retreating to Idaho to avoid voting on climate change legislation. In Baker City, you still hear anger over a timber mill that shuttered more than a decade ago, in part as a result of a steep decline in logging on federal land. Kayla Keith, who works at a cafe, wasn't too surprised one recent day when she was pumping gas at a Maverick station and got grief from a neighbor for wearing a mask. Keith lives with her elderly parents — her mom is diabetic and dad has lung issues. "If they caught this, I don't like their odds," Keith said. "I wear a mask for the obvious reasons; you want to protect everybody else." In a divided country, in a divided town even, something as small as wearing a mask can mark you on one side or the other: red versus blue, pro-science versus anti-science; you're taking the virus seriously or you think it's overblown.  "We only have one person who's been affected by the virus in Baker County, and you can't tell us we have to live under the same restrictions as a city. That's ridiculous,"  said Harvey, the commission chair.  Still, in Baker City, you see plenty of folks wearing masks in grocery stores and other places.   At the old stone courthouse, Republican County Commissioner Mark Bennett, the county's incident commander for the pandemic, said it's a misnomer that people in rural places aren't taking the virus seriously because they don't know many who have been affected. It turns out a cousin of Bennett's from back East died from it. "Part of it is, I have to admit, she didn't take medical services," he said. "She just thought she could tough it out, and by then it was too late."

             Jenny Mowe, owner of Sweet Wife Baking in Baker City, decided to stay open and offer takeout and other services during the pandemic. "We should be acting as a collective" Bennett led a proposal to begin reopening the county that the governor recently approved despite the lawsuit against the statewide restrictions. They added almost 50 hospital beds and hired more than the required number of contact tracers. Bennett said social distancing is mostly a way of life here anyway. "I have a 52-mile commute every day. I think I passed one car," he chuckles. Officials such as Bennett downplayed the rural-urban fights in the news media.  A few businesses in town have been able to stay open since March, and many more are now beginning to reopen. But just like everywhere else in the country, these are tough times.  Jenny Mowe, owner of Sweet Wife Baking, cleared out her cafe to create a contact-free ordering area. Many of her employees were furloughed, and most of her contracts with area restaurants were canceled. Talking through her mask, Mowe said she is turned off by all the political fights. It's stressful enough trying to survive and adapt her business right now. "I think when you get such a divisive message from leadership, that really hurts something like this," said Mowe, a former professional women's basketball player and University of Oregon star. "We should be acting as a collective and [saying] this is what we're doing as a country to get through this." For now, Mowe is just trying to get through the week and keep her doors open, let alone the next few months.

Her husband, a biologist at Dartmouth College, had a slightly bigger adjustment to make when classes went virtual. They're both still employed, and Hoppa says she feels "so incredibly grateful" about that during this massive economic crisis. Her family has been able to do things like buy a new car and get a good deal on it. FACES OF THE CORONAVIRUS RECESSION  Jobs lost. Businesses in peril. Meetings gone virtual. Faces Of The Coronavirus Recession offers snapshots of working lives upended by the pandemic.  "It feels weird to be a consumer right now," Hoppa says. "I'm so conscious that there are people all over the United States who can't even afford food to eat and who have lost their jobs and are really struggling." The Hoppas are also donating money and trying to support local businesses, but sometimes it's not obvious if spending their money locally is even the right thing to do. "There's this contradictory impulse," Hoppa says. "I want to use the money we have to support our local restaurants and keep retail afloat. But you also know, OK, if I'm buying things ... that store has to be open and possibly it's putting those people at risk." "It's just hard to figure out. What's the right thing to do?" she asks. "What's the morally right thing to do in this situation?" Read more stories in Faces Of The Coronavirus Recession.

             Residents of the Colombian capital Bogotá hang red rags from their windows and balconies to signal their need for help with food during the coronavirus pandemic. With COVID-19 deaths spiking in many Latin American countries, Colombia — which has confirmed more than 23,000 cases and 776 deaths — is extending its nationwide lockdown until the end of this month. That has meant more hardship for people living hand to mouth. So some desperate Colombians have been sending out an eye-catching SOS — with encouragement from local politicians. In a sprawling mountainside slum in Soacha, just south of the capital Bogotá, needy families tie or hang something red from their doors, windows and balconies — a red T-shirt, a red dishtowel, even red pajamas — as a distress signal to neighbors who may be willing and able to provide them with food. "They will ask: 'Do you need tomatoes? Take some! Do you need onions? Take the onions!' " says one grateful recipient, María Mendoza, who sold magazines and used clothes before the lockdown but now depends on handouts to feed her family of four. "And when I have some extra food, I do the same." Soacha's "red-rag movement," which started in March, was the brainchild of Mayor Juan Carlos Saldarriaga. He manages a city of more than 1 million mostly poor and working-class people. Some were displaced from their farms and villages by Colombia's long guerrilla war. Thousands are refugees from Venezuela's economic meltdown. Working from home is not an option, since many earn a living as maids, security guards, bus drivers and factory workers. Others sell candy or wash windshields for spare change at intersections. Few residents have much in the way of savings. To convince them to shelter in place, the mayor said, food donations are key. "I have always said that more people here could end up dying of hunger than from the coronavirus," Saldarriaga says. He knows his city well. Saldarriaga, 47, grew up in a poor household but graduated from law school and then jumped into politics. He took office in January, before the coronavirus began spreading through Colombia. Saldarriaga began organizing massive food handouts in March. Soacha's city hall has so far handed food to 350,000 families, but city workers can distribute rice, beans, pasta and other provisions to only about 6,000 families per day. So the mayor called on the neediest to fly makeshift red banners from their doors and windows as a signal for immediate help. "It's not just city hall that has to act," he says. "You have to promote solidarity among neighbors." Since then, the red-rag movement has spread to Bogotá, Medellín, Barranquilla, Florencia and other cities. Under a similar initiative in Guatemala, families that are going hungry fly white flags.

             A Soacha resident hangs a red cloth out the window. "I have always said that more people here could end up dying of hunger than from the coronavirus," Soacha Mayor Juan Carlos Saldarriaga says. In some Soacha neighborhoods, homemade red flags fly from nearly every building, including the cramped apartment of Ana Ibáñez. She explains that after the lockdown, her husband lost his job as a car mechanic and she's been unable to sell snacks and soda on the streets. But, she says, "My good neighbors have given me sugar and rice." Soacha's Friday night to Monday morning curfew is one of Colombia's tightest local restrictions. So far, Saldarriaga says, Soacha has registered just four deaths from COVID-19. And the food donations have kept residents from going hungry. But some see the red flags as symbols of a tattered social safety net and government inefficiency. "The red rags in the poor barrios are like red cards for the way policies have been put into place during the pandemic," former Bogotá Mayor Clara López wrote in Semana magazine, referring to the card used to expel players from soccer matches. What's more, patience is growing thin among Soacha residents. Saldarriaga is constantly trying to calm the nerves of those who complain they haven't received any food. They're also angry about the weekend curfew and the national government's lockdown. "I have debts. I have a special-needs daughter. I have bills to pays," says Diana Muñoz, who's itching to get back on the streets to sell roses. But there are just 50 intensive care beds and few hospitals in Soacha. That's why Saldarriaga is refusing to budge — and is sticking with the red-rag program. "People tell me: 'I don't want charity. I want to go back to work,' " he says. "But that would be like sending them to their deaths."School district lines have become engines of inequity in many states. Not only can they be used to keep children out of a neighborhood's schools, they can also keep a district's wealth in. But with many districts facing severe budget cuts because of the coronavirus pandemic, a new report proposes a radical solution: Leave the lines, but spread the wealth. The report, titled Clean Slate, comes from EdBuild, a nonprofit that advocates for equitable school funding. It's a moonshot pitch to many district and state leaders that recommends distributing local property tax revenue more broadly — at the county or even state level. According to EdBuild, only 13 states currently do this.  Loading...  Don't see the graphic above? Click here. After a nationwide analysis of school funding data, the report found, "the bigger the school district taxing jurisdiction, the more equity was being created," says Rebecca Sibilia, EdBuild's founder and CEO. Under this reimagining of America's school funding system, EdBuild found, more than 2 out of 3 K-12 students (69%) — and 76% of low-income students — would receive equal or greater school funding than they do now, an average increase of nearly $1,000 per student. Sibilia admits some communities may see this idea as a threat to their local control of schools, but funding should not be confused with governance, she says. "I hope this report will take the first step toward really challenging this question of whether or not being able to run your own schools means being able to keep all of the money that you happen to have," Sibilia says. To understand Sibilia's proposed solution, here's a quick primer on the system as it is: On average, America's schools receive nearly half of their funding from local sources, mostly property taxes. But those local dollars usually don't cross school district lines. So if one community's property wealth far surpasses that of its neighbors across the road, the inequity will show up not just in the size of the homes or the number of businesses, but in classroom spending, too. According to EdBuild, in counties with more than one school district, the average difference between the highest- and lowest-wealth district is more than $6,000 per student. And these spending inequities within a given county are most common in northern states.  Loading...  Don't see the graphic above? Click here. The report found that school districts in the South — in a triangle tipped by Maryland, Florida and Louisiana — distribute local funding more equitably than their neighbors to the north for one big reason: Districts in the South are larger, and tend to follow county lines. Georgia, for example, has 159 counties, but the vast majority (139) have just one school district in them, Sibilia says. New York, on the other hand, has just 62 counties, but 57 contain two or more districts. The average difference in local revenue per student, between the highest and lowest-wealth districts in the same Georgia county is $186. In New York, that difference is $22,006 per student. In addition to New York, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Connecticut and California all rank among the worst states in the nation for cross-border equity. Sibilia says this idea that broader, county- or state-based school district spending allows for more equitable local funding, has come up again and again in previous EdBuild reports. "Last year we put out a report that highlighted the 969 worst school districts, in terms of both racial and funding gaps. Only 66 of those school district borders, the worst in the country, exist in states that draw school district funding lines along counties." EdBuild's report comes as districts across the country face severe budget cuts as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. State revenues, driven largely by income and sales taxes, make up the other half of schools' funding, after local sources, and with revenues crashing states have already warned schools to prepare for steep cuts. That's why, Sibilia says, it's more important than ever for state lawmakers to rethink how communities collect and share their local property tax revenue. "I would find it inexplicable that [state lawmakers] don't do that at the same time that they take the massive cuts that we know are coming," Sibilia says. "If they do the dual injustice of taking the cuts from the state funds and the injustice of not taking action to spread out local wealth at the same time, then we're going to just continue to repeat the same problems that have always existed in school funding." The chief obstacle to Sibilia's fix is the fact that, while nearly 70% of students would benefit, that leaves almost a third of students who would not. Those students would see declines in local school funding, making this recommendation political kryptonite in many communities. Even in places that may be receptive, change likely would not happen fast enough to help schools through the current, pandemic-driven budget crisis. "This is an idea that's ... unbelievably difficult and is not something that would help in the fall," says Michael Griffith, who studies school funding at the Learning Policy Institute. Communities who would stand to lose money would need to be convinced that the change is still in their best interest, he says. "If this were easy to do, it would have been done." Griffith points to Michigan as an example of just how hard change can be. In 1994, the state moved from a traditional, local property tax school funding system to a statewide tax. But to do so, lawmakers took dramatic steps. "To get everybody on board, they said, 'Most of you will get a property tax cut. We'll make up that property tax cut with sales and cigarette taxes and some other things. And then you're going to share that property tax revenue with others in the state.'" That sweeping property tax cut, says Griffith, helped people to buy in. But it also made Michigan's schools more dependent on sales tax revenue, which is more volatile than property taxes in an economic downturn. While school funding experts may not share Sibilia's optimism for how quickly states might be willing to reimagine their school funding systems, they do agree that it's an important conversation to have. "It would benefit all of us if we had more equitably funded schools," says Michael Leachman at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. "I hope that we're moving to a place where we recognize that dealing with these kinds of underlying structural questions really helps all of us."
                President Trump and China's President Xi Jinping, shown in 2019, have faced criticism for their handling of the coronavirus. Both are now pushing hard for a vaccine. The United States has already agreed to pay a drug company more than $1 billion to produce a vaccine that's yet to be approved. Xi says if China succeeds in developing a vaccine, it will be declared "a global public good."

             President Trump and China's President Xi Jinping, shown in 2019, have faced criticism for their handling of the coronavirus. Both are now pushing hard for a vaccine. The United States has already agreed to pay a drug company more than $1 billion to produce a vaccine that's yet to be approved. Xi says if China succeeds in developing a vaccine, it will be declared "a global public good." The race to defeat the coronavirus can be viewed in two very distinct ways. One is based on international cooperation, with a vaccine treated as a "global public good." The other is competitive, a battle between nations that's being described as "vaccine nationalism." Many are hoping for the former, but are seeing signs of the latter. The main competition, on this and many other global issues, appears to be between the United States and China. Both President Trump and China's President Xi Jinping have faced criticism for their handling of the coronavirus outbreak. Success with a vaccine at home could make up for the earlier shortcomings. "We're about to have an unprecedented battle over access to the vaccines, which will be far more challenging if we're in a U.S.-versus-China Cold War environment," said Ian Bremmer, president of the Eurasia Group, a political consulting firm. Trump's Operation Warp Speed is designed to develop a COVID-19 vaccine for Americans as soon as possible, and with an eye on the November presidential election. Last week, the U.S. government announced it was paying up to $1.2 billion to the drugmaker AstraZeneca to start work on a vaccine that could be ready as early as October, though there's not yet a vaccine that's been proved to be safe and effective.  China's line Meanwhile, China's Xi has adopted a somewhat softer public line that some are describing as "vaccine diplomacy." Xi says China will spend $2 billion to help developing countries. China also is among dozens of countries that have signed on to a resolution by member states of the World Health Organization that says a vaccine should be treated as a "global public good" to be distributed widely, fairly and cheaply. China faced global condemnation for its early efforts to downplay the severity of the virus and has sought to rewrite the narrative by promoting its efforts to find a vaccine and assist other countries. China is making a major push to develop a vaccine at home and has at least four trials underway. Xi wants China to be a world leader in the most important technologies of the 21st century, including biopharmaceuticals. If China became the first to develop a vaccine, it would consider it a huge victory. However, some U.S. national security officials say the Chinese efforts include attempts to hack into American and other Western drug companies to steal valuable research information. "We have the full expectation that China will do everything in their power to obtain any viable research that we are conducting here in the U.S.," said Bill Evanina, the director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center. "That will be in line with their capabilities and intent the last decade plus, and we are expecting them to continue to do so." Global pandemic, global solution While one country, or one company, may take the lead when it comes to a vaccine, the worldwide nature of the problem points to the need for a truly global solution, according to those in the international health community. For example, AstraZeneca, which is getting the U.S. government funding, is a Swedish-British firm, which is hoping to produce vaccines based on promising research conducted at Oxford University in Britain. AstraZeneca, like all the major Western pharmaceutical companies, has offices and manufacturing plants spread around the globe. Many players in many countries are likely to be involved. But it takes time to ramp up vaccine production, and this points to a crucial question: In a world of more than 7 billion people, who's at the front of the line, and who's at the back? "The challenge is going to come in the first year in terms of capacity, combined with disagreements about who should be first, second and third in line," said Nancy Kass, professor of bioethics and public health at Johns Hopkins University. New drugs and vaccines traditionally go first to the wealthiest countries, and that's the expectation in this case as well. But the exact order could depend on where the vaccine is first developed. The U.S. and China could have very different priorities on how to distribute a vaccine.

             Pharmacist Michael Witte (left) gives Neal Browning a shot in the first-stage study of a potential coronavirus vaccine on March 16 in Seattle. Countries and companies are racing to find a vaccine with some describing the competition as "vaccine nationalism." Rich countries have been hit hardest by the virus so far. But in many of these nations, COVID-19 cases are leveling off or declining, while they are rising rapidly in the developing world, including countries such as India, Brazil and Peru. Assessing needs Global health organizations are working on plans with a focus on poorer nations. Kate Elder of Doctors Without Borders says her organization often faces challenges in dealing with Western pharmaceutical companies that have tremendous leverage because they are the only one, or one of just a few, that make a critical drug. "We can design things as a global community," she said. "But ultimately, since the power is in the pharmaceutical corporation's hands to make those decisions, it's up to them. At what scale they produce these vaccines, at what price they set them, and who are the first customers that they'll cater to." Because the demand for a new vaccine will be so great, nations, political leaders and drug companies are likely to face a range of conflicting pressures. They will need to provide the vaccine at home but will also face intense scrutiny to share it widely, fairly and cheaply abroad. "It's set up to be a massive geopolitical battle," said Bremmer, of the Eurasia Group. "Not just around the discovery of the vaccine, but the manufacturing chain — with billions of doses needed, and the challenges of a global vaccination campaign."

             Since Russia's expansive influence operation during the 2016 election, Americans' usage of social media has only increased — and drastically so, as a result of the pandemic. America's new socially distant reality has warped the landscape of the 2020 election. Candidates aren't out knocking on doors, and U.S. election officials are bracing for a record surge in mail ballots. But another subtler shift is also occurring — inside people's brains. Four years after Russia's expansive influence operation, which touched the feeds of more than 100 million users on Facebook alone, Americans' usage of social media has only increased — and drastically so, as a result of the pandemic. More people are more online right now than at any point in human history, and experts say the Internet has gotten only more flooded since 2016 with bad information. "It's far, far worse in terms of quantity," says Steven Brill, a former journalist and now the CEO of NewsGuard, a browser extension that helps users discern the quality of what they're reading online. In April, NewsGuard published a list of 36 websites that were peddling hoaxes related to the coronavirus. Just a month later, that list had ballooned to more than 200. A study out last week from researchers at Carnegie Mellon University found that nearly half of the Twitter accounts spreading messages about the coronavirus pandemic are likely bots — automated accounts designed to make it appear that more humans are acting a certain way than truly are. And in 2020, as in 2016, it's only a matter of time before the focus shifts back away from the coronavirus and to the presidential election. "The same thing is going to happen with the political sphere. There's just no doubt about it," Brill says. "The great thing about the Internet is everyone can be a publisher. The really bad thing about the Internet is everyone can be a publisher." More than ever before Social media usage in the U.S. had already been on a steady increase over the past few years, even before the pandemic left millions of Americans stuck in their homes with many hours to kill on their phones and computers.  Loading...  Don't see the graphic above? Click here. That was despite the negative barrage of publicity suffered by the social media giants — Facebook in particular — in the wake of the 2016 election. Among the issues: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg downplaying Russian interference efforts, the Cambridge Analytica scandal and a bevy of research that seemed to point to people being happier when they weren't so connected. In the face of all that, Americans stayed online. Facebook's main platform saw a small dip in U.S. users in the time after the election, according to Edison Research, but Facebook also owns Instagram, which has seen a steady increase in overall users over the past four years. The pandemic has supercharged those gains. "We know that people especially rely on social apps in times of crisis and in times when we can't be together in person," Zuckerberg said on April 29. "And right now, we are experiencing both of those all around the world at the same time." For the first time ever, Zuckerberg announced, more than 3 billion people used Facebook, Messenger, Instagram or WhatsApp in a single month. Twitter announced last month as well that it saw a first-quarter 24% year-over-year increase in the number of daily users who saw ads. The increased usage spans the globe, says Pinar Yildirim, a marketing professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania who specializes in social media trends. "If you look at Italy, if you look at Spain, if you look at the United States and Canada, you see the same patterns," says Yildirim. "There are more users, in terms of unique users. There are more frequent visits," she says. "And then you look at the amount of time people are spending on social media — that's where you start seeing even more of an increase." Spin cycle One way that increased usage may be felt in the 2020 election isn't in just the amount of false information being seen and shared, Yildirim says — but in how polarized the American public is during the campaign cycle. A study from last year found people's usage of Facebook correlated with how polarized they are and how open they are to understanding the views or ideas of the opposition party. Facebook had internal research pointing to the same conclusion, according to a new report from the Wall Street Journal, but the company reportedly brushed it aside. "Our algorithms exploit the human brain's attraction to divisiveness," said one slide, from a 2018 presentation. This idea isn't new. Much of Russia's influence operation on social media in 2016 wasn't about introducing new ideas or controversy but instead was about furthering racial and political divides already present in American culture. "To put it simply, in this space Russia wants to watch us tear ourselves apart," said David Porter, an assistant section chief with the FBI's Foreign Influence Task Force, earlier this year. More people spending more time on the platforms where this takes place likely will mean even more attempts at amplifying divisions and stoking discord. No easy solution Many federal policymakers, members of Congress and Big Tech leaders agree there are problems, and they are taking some action. Shortly after the last presidential race, the social media companies went into damage control mode. There were multiple days' worth of Capitol Hill hearings, and new policies rolled out aimed at warning people before they clicked on conspiracy theories. Facebook introduced a feature last year that tries to limit the spread of websites that are disproportionately popular on the platform, compared with the broader Web. Twitter said it was taking down more than a million suspicious and fake accounts a day. And in that same April announcement in which Zuckerberg beamed about Facebook's increased global reach during the pandemic, he talked about how much the company has done to warn people about bad information. "We partner with independent fact-checkers who have marked more than 4,000 pieces of content related to COVID as false, which has resulted in more than 40 million warning labels being seen across our services," he said. Twitter announced a similar labeling approach for tweets "containing disputed or misleading information" related to the pandemic and even decided this week to add a fact-check label to one of President Trump's tweets for the first time. New: Twitter has added a "get the facts" link to a false Trump tweet about mail-in voting, which links to a moment refuting his claim. (background here https://t.co/wCQQZtq6vs) https://t.co/P1YAgDzCom But many experts aren't satisfied with the industry's work on the issue. For one thing, there's research to suggest that the very act of seeing a headline, even if it's notated as false by the platform or by a fact-checker, can still contribute to people believing its claim. "Fact-checking is predicated on the assumption that people will change their mind when confronted with correct information," writes Alice Marwick, a professor at the University of North Carolina, in a paper published in the Georgetown Law Technology Review. "As we have seen, this ignores a wide variety of social and cultural factors, and is not supported by empirical evidence. ... In fact, fact-checking may have the opposite effect of making stories 'more sticky.' " A number of organizations, including Brill's NewsGuard, aimed at curing what some see as this kind of media literacy problem have popped up since the 2016 election. While well-intentioned, they may be missing the true problem — which is how the platforms allow for bad sensationalist information to go viral, says Peter Pomerantsev, the author of the book This Is Not Propaganda, which details a number of information and influence operations on social media. "So many studies have shown people can be super-educated and super-critically minded and ignore any evidence that goes against their identity," Pomerantsev says. "People will be very critical when they see something they don't like, and then they switch off their critical faculties when it agrees with their worldviews." Plus, social media platforms are inherently addicting, Pomerantsev says, so he argues that people can't be blamed for not quitting those platforms cold turkey despite what they may be doing to the structure of democracy. The real answer, he argues, is for the government to get involved in regulation. "We don't really have any oversight. They're marking their own homework," Pomerantsev says. "And that's not good enough." That position was a legal and political minefield before the pandemic — and between the coronavirus crisis and the election, no one expects movement on the issue in the U.S. government this year, or anytime soon. This means that as the 2020 presidential election goes forward, posts will be posted, and tweets will be tweeted. And because of the pandemic, social media will play some role in the outcome, says Yildirim, of the University of Pennsylvania. "If you asked me two months ago, I would have had very different predictions about social media's role on the election," she says. "But now it's become the primary source of information and social communication."

             The city of Wuhan, where the coronavirus first began to spread, is pictured on May 14. Many Chinese cities have seen rush hour traffic return to pre-pandemic levels — or worse — after reopening, according to traffic data company TomTom. Cities around the world are trying to figure out how to avoid disastrous gridlock as residents resume travel while avoiding public transit. Over the past few months, cities have had to deal with tremendous challenges — fighting a pandemic, preserving essential services, protecting their own workers, coping with devastating budget cuts. One thing local officials didn't have to worry about was traffic, as the pandemic emptied city streets.  But that's about to change.  Loading...  Many city dwellers, trying to maintain social distance, are continuing to avoid public transit. If they replace bus or subway trips with car rides, congestion could grow dire.  Eve Strother, a lawyer in Boston, says she won't be getting on the T anytime soon.  She's worried about being close to people who refuse to wear masks or follow social distancing guidelines. "It's kind of scary to not know how your commute will go," she says.  Strother feels much safer in her car. Some cities in China have already seen rush hour traffic significantly worse than before the pandemic.  "We could really see an outcome from this where we have crushing gridlock," says Corinne Kisner, the executive director of the National Association of City Transportation Officials. The organization recently released a guide for cities on how to adapt to the ongoing coronavirus crisis and the recovery ahead. Normally, cities would respond to growing traffic by trying to boost rides on buses or subways.  "Being able to move more people in the least amount of space has been the mantra of transit agencies around the world," says Tiffany Chu, the CEO of transportation planning software company Remix. "And now all of a sudden with COVID, because you have to socially or physically distance, that mantra just no longer holds up. And it's mind-boggling for people who've been working in transportation for decades." Making more space for cars, scooters and pedestrians   There's no silver bullet to solve this problem, but one key strategy is to push more people to travel by bike, foot or scooter instead of by car.  Cities like London and Paris, which have already committed to supporting bicycle travel, have accelerated their plans to build bike lanes to help reduce future pandemic-worsened traffic jams. In the U.S., in contrast, many cities have so far focused on urgent needs during the pandemic shutdowns, instead of the crowding that may come after. Cities from Oakland to Boston have taken street space previously reserved for cars and used it to reduce crowding and promote social distancing — from expanding sidewalks to using parking lots as dining spaces.  But some of these measures, particularly "slow streets" or "open streets" reserved for non-car traffic, could also help replace car trips and reduce traffic in the long term.  Seattle, which blocked through traffic on some roads and dubbed them Stay Healthy Streets, was the first major U.S. city to announce it would make the pandemic-induced changes permanent.   "The support and the positivity we got in just the first few weeks of putting these out meant that it ... was pretty easy to say, 'Let's make this permanent,' " says Sam Zimbabwe, the director of Seattle's Department of Transportation.  The streets were meant to support both recreation and travel needs, he says, but as more people resume daily travel, "the transportation aspects will probably grow in importance," he says.  Seattle was building on an established network of greenways and bike paths, and many cities have similarly used existing plans and policies as a launching pad. "I think cities have been really proactive and sort of standing up projects and initiatives essentially overnight — or within a week or so," says Zabe Bent, the director of design at the National Association of City Transportation Officials. "Open streets, shared streets, bike lanes ... projects that can can just be moved forward a lot faster because there are fewer people traveling on our streets by car."  And keeping transit rolling, with more empty seats Meanwhile, public transit remains crucial — particularly for communities hardest hit by the coronavirus. Many essential workers live far from their workplaces and don't have access to a car.  Loading...  Transit, an app that provides public transit data, surveyed users who kept riding transit during the crisis. People of color, low-income riders and people who work in food service or health care were disproportionately likely to keep taking transit during the pandemic.  "I think some of the rhetoric I've been hearing in the transportation world — and I don't think this is intentional — is almost painting transit as sacrificial ... [that] it's not going to be safe for a long time; we've all got to get on bikes," says Lynda Lopez,  an advocacy manager at the Active Transportation Alliance in Chicago. "I think we need to realize that public transit is a core part of how people move, especially in communities that don't have other options."  Safety measures, from masks to extra cleaning, can help keep transit as safe as possible for essential riders — and vulnerable transit workers. Kisner, of the National Association of City Transportation Officials, says cities can also increase the frequency of buses or trains, add bus lanes and redesign their bus routes to better serve essential workers who rely on transit services — not just 9-to-5 office workers. "A lot of transit systems haven't really changed their network design in, frankly, decades," she says. "It's been a very slow and gradual process." Now, moving slowly isn't an option for cities that want to keep up with a world transformed by the coronavirus.  Tamika Butler is the head of California planning and equity and inclusion at Toole Design, a consulting firm that helps cities with transportation planning, especially for biking and walking. She says community input is essential as cities are moving with unprecedented speed. "There has to be a balance between answering the call and doing what folks need while still not re-creating processes that continue to exclude people," she says. Done properly, she says, this is an opportunity to address the underlying inequities that have long shaped American cities, and not just keep streets moving, but make them more accessible — and safer — for everyone.

             Staff work at a drive-through coronavirus testing site outside the American Airlines center in North Dallas in late March. As COVID-19 continues to spread across the country, state and local health officials rush to try to detect and contain outbreaks before they get out of control. A key to that is testing, and despite a slow start, testing has increased around the country. But it's still not always easy to get a test. While many things can affect access to testing, location is an important starting point. NPR investigated the location of public testing sites in Texas, one of the first states to reopen, to see how they were distributed between predominantly white and predominantly minority areas. The investigation found that in four out of six of the largest cities in Texas, testing sites are disproportionately located in whiter neighborhoods.  Loading...  With evidence growing that black and Latino communities are harder hit by this deadly disease, community leaders say that testing disparities are problematic. Many experts warn that if communities don't test the most vulnerable, they could miss pockets of infection and have new large outbreaks. "If you're casting a very small net, and you're shining a flashlight on a small portion of infections that are out there, you might think you're doing OK," says Dr. Jennifer Nuzzo, lead epidemiologist for the Johns Hopkins COVID Testing Insights Initiative. "Whereas there's this whole pool of infections that you haven't seen." Nationally, it's hard to determine where there may be testing disparities because data is scarce. Most states and cities across the country either do not track or do not report the racial breakdown of tests that are conducted. But there are media reports of racial disparities that suggest that the patterns identified in Texas are happening in other parts of the country. "I was acutely concerned from the very beginning," says Dr. Wayne Frederick, president of Howard University, a historically black college in Washington, D.C., who is leading efforts by the university to bring more testing to black neighborhoods. The lack of attention paid to minority health care, he says, "is not a good strategy for our health care system and for the vulnerable part of our community." Texas: Whiter neighborhoods have more testing sites In Dallas, a stark divide exists between the north and south ends of town. Interstate 30 bisects the city and largely serves as a borderline between the city's predominantly white neighborhoods to the north and the predominantly black or Hispanic neighborhoods in the south. In North Dallas there are 20 testing sites. Southern Dallas has nine, with a third of those sitting within a mile of the interstate. Dallas County, home to the city of Dallas, has the second-highest COVID-19 case count in the state.  Loading...  In three other cities, the trend was the same: More testing sites were in whiter neighborhoods. In each city, NPR ranked neighborhoods based on their density of white residents. The analysis then focused on the half with the lowest density of white residents to see how many testing sites that are open to the public are located in those areas: To determine where permanent testing sites were located, NPR contacted health care providers in those six largest cities in Texas — representing a total population of 7.9 million by most recent Census estimates — and reviewed government, health care and news websites. The testing site locations include facilities where residents can go to get diagnostic testing for active infection, such as urgent care clinics, hospitals and drive-through testing sites. They don't include sites such as doctor's offices and some hospitals that may provide tests for admitted patients but are not available to the public. Mobile sites, where locations regularly change, are also not included. Reporters analyzed the racial breakdown in areas where testing sites are located using census tract data. NPR offered city and county health officials the opportunity to review the findings and point to additional testing sites.  Loading...  These disparities could point to a larger problem in Texas, says Nuzzo. Without good testing access in places where minorities live, the state could be missing cases. She notes that Texas has a low rate of positive cases — a measure that can indicate a community is conducting sufficient testing — but it also has one of the lowest rates of testing among states. "It's either that there's just not that much infection in Texas, or that there is infection, but they're testing the wrong people," says Nuzzo. "And it's been hard for me to believe that there's not that much infection in Texas." The Texas Division of Emergency Management and the Department of State Health Services did not make anyone available for an interview on the state's testing plan. The national picture Testing disparities have also been reported in New York City and Chicago. Some communities across the country are starting to identify and tackle the issue, but only four states currently publish racial breakdowns of who is being tested: Nevada, Delaware, Kansas and Illinois. In New York City, authorities have identified hotspots in low-income and minority neighborhoods and have set up testing sites at over 70 faith-based organizations to target those communities. And in Wisconsin, where some of the first reports of stark racial disparities emerged, free testing is now available to all black, Hispanic, and Native American residents. At the federal level, the House of Representatives passed a wide-ranging coronavirus relief bill this month that would, in part, fund testing centers in minority communities. Continuing negotiations on the bill, however, make it unlikely that it will pass the Republican-controlled Senate in its current form. Democratic Rep. Bobby Rush of Illinois has introduced a separate bill that would fund testing sites, prioritizing those around coronavirus hot spots and in underserved communities. "We don't know the numbers, we don't know the number of people who have not been diagnosed," says Rush, who represents a mostly black district in Chicago, recalling his early response to Chicago's outbreak. "We were operating blindly regarding the individual community response to COVID-19, and the white community was better informed." The House Energy and Commerce committee also announced Tuesday it would hold a hearing on states' testing plans, including access to testing for minority communities. But local communities might have trouble piecing together what testing access looks like. Local public health departments have dealt with years of underfunding, and the federal government isn't keeping track of and publishing its own list of testing sites. States may not have complete data either. Texas has its own state map, but some sites located by NPR were missing or out of date. "For the most part across the U.S., it's really, really hard to rely on those government websites for the information," says Tarryn Marcus, who leads a volunteer effort called Get Tested COVID-19, which is attempting to compile a national database of testing locations. "There's a lot of inconsistency, a lot of outdated information — stuff that was true maybe a month ago or a few weeks ago but it's no longer true." Marcus' organization is attempting to fill in the gaps with their database, which was compiled over two months by more than 80 volunteers. Though it's still not complete, their data reinforce what NPR found in Texas cities. Marcus' team analyzed the sites they do have to look at where there were large numbers of people without a nearby testing site. Across the country, most of the areas with gaps, she says, were in blue collar communities with low income. Cities in Texas vary in their approach Not all cities in Texas have a disparity in testing site locations. In San Antonio, the state's second largest city, testing sites are equally distributed by race. Houston, the state's largest city, has more testing sites in minority neighborhoods than white neighborhoods. The city says it took into account risk factors for disease, as well as CDC testing data, to determine where to target its testing.  Loading...  But in Dallas, recent research by the UT Health School of Public Health identified parts of South Dallas as vulnerable to COVID-19 hospitalization because of higher concentration of some chronic conditions like asthma, diabetes and obesity. These were the same areas — predominantly minority neighborhoods — that NPR's analysis show to lack testing sites. The state does not provide detailed data on the races of coronavirus patients, and Dallas County's is incomplete. "If we're looking to protect our most vulnerable in the population, then we need to concentrate some testing resources in the areas where they're more likely to live," says Dr. Stephen Linder, one of the UT Health researchers. Dr. Philip Huang, director of Dallas County Health and Human Services, said many of the testing sites in north Dallas are at private sector providers. That's where most of Dallas' hospitals are as well. Huang said the county has tried to focus public sector testing efforts towards underserved communities as much as possible. "We have been trying to definitely target those resources that we have control over into those areas," he said, including two federally-funded drive-thru sites, one in South Dallas and the other downtown. Combined, they can test 1,000 people a day. "A lot of the disparity ... is reflecting some of that private sector availability of tests in the northern part of Dallas compared to southern Dallas." In an attempt to fill the gaps, in mid-May the city started sending health care workers to residents' homes if they don't have transportation to get to a testing site. That effort has averaged 20 tests per day, according to figures provided by the city. Other cities have set up temporary sites that are open for days at a time before moving on to the next location. Even the public health systems, which exist to fill these gaps, present obstacles for someone trying to get a test. Parkland, the public hospital system in Dallas, does have clinics in South Dallas that can test, but you have to be a patient already or be seen through the ER. You can also be referred to Parkland through one of the area's federally qualified health centers, but those centers don't do testing themselves. For cities that have testing disparities like these, the solution involves not just opening an equal number of testing sites in minority neighborhoods, but actually focusing on those that are most at risk, says Dr. William Owen, a medical school administrator whose work has focused on health care access for racial minorities. In other words, Owen says, communities should make sure it's easy to get tested in places carrying the heaviest burden of the disease. "That's where I'm going to plot my testing sites," he says. "Direct your resources specifically while they're limited — which is what they are right now — to where you think you'll get the most hits." Other barriers to testing Location, of course, isn't the only factor that determines whether at-risk people will get tested for the disease. Other barriers can keep someone from being tested, including whether a doctor needs to refer you to a testing center or whether you can just walk in; how much the tests cost if you're uninsured; and how much time you have to wait at a testing site. Cost could be an issue in a place like Texas, which has not expanded Medicaid and has the highest uninsured rate in the country. Lack of transportation and concerns about being able to work after testing positive can also keep people away from testing sites. These challenges can be especially difficult for people of color to navigate: They're more likely to be uninsured and, in some places, more likely to work in essential services, making it difficult or impossible to spend hours traveling or waiting at a testing site. "This disease has absolutely highlighted many disparities that we have in our country when it comes to public health," says Angela Clendenin, an instructional assistant professor of epidemiology at the Texas A&M School of Public Health. "And it boils down to access." One way to deal with these challenges is to work with community leaders and groups that people are already familiar with to encourage them to get tested, says Owen, the medical school administrator. Leaning on faith-based leaders to stress the importance of testing, along with setting up makeshift testing sites at community centers like churches, could bring large-scale public health efforts to the doors of people who might otherwise be excluded. A South Dallas church, for example, hosted a two-day mobile testing event last week, sponsored by the state and National Guard. "How do you do voter registration? You do it at the local high school. You maybe have someone in front of the grocery store in the neighborhood. You have somebody at the church," Owen says. "If I were the mayor, I'd say, 'Great, let's have the arena. But by the way, we're going to have a small testing center at the big churches.'" NPR gathered addresses of permanent testing sites from county, city and state websites, health care providers and news reports. NPR verified these sites by contacting health care providers and city officials by phone or email. City and county officials were offered the opportunity to review the findings and point to additional testing sites. Mobile and temporary testing sites are not included in this dataset. Sites that only perform antibody testing are not included. NPR geocoded testing site locations on an online geocoding platform to determine what census tract they were within. A reporter verified each location with a geocoding "accuracy score" of below 0.9. For each city, the analysis included only census tracts within the city's official boundaries, which do not include suburbs. The Census Bureau provided median household income and demographic data, which were used along with data from the Social Vulnerability Index (SVI). The main demographic measure referenced in this story was the percent of the population who identify as 'white alone.' For income, percent white and SVI, NPR calculated the number of sites and distance from a site for tracts above and below the city's overall median for that measure. Medians referenced are medians of census tracts, not population medians, and may therefore differ slightly from population medians. The dataset used in this analysis is available on Google Sheets.

             Rep. Tony Cardenas, D-Calif., cleans his desk during a House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health hearing earlier this month. Updated at 8:45 p.m. ET More than 20 Republican members of Congress and constituents are suing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other officials in federal court to block proxy voting, arguing the practice is unconstitutional, according to House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. Earlier this month the House approved new rules that allowed remote voting and hearings for the first time in the chamber's history. Under the changes a member can vote on behalf of up to 10 colleagues who are unable to travel to the Capitol during the coronavirus pandemic.  In the lawsuit filed Tuesday, the House members argue that the change sets a dangerous precedent and dilutes lawmakers' votes. The chamber is scheduled to vote by proxy Wednesday for the first time since the rules went into effect. As of late Tuesday, more than 55 members filed notification letters with the House Clerk of their plan to vote by proxy. In a statement Tuesday evening, McCarthy called the proxy voting decision "reckless and partisan," and said that GOP members had to respond. "Rapid and robust legal relief is necessary," he said. "The alternative --- a small number of members dictating the businesses of the whole House while the people's voice is diluted --- is unacceptable and would only make it more difficult for Congress to respond in the national interest. We must assemble." McCarthy is joined in the lawsuit by Reps. Steve Scalise, Jim Jordan, Liz Cheney, Tom Cole and 16 other members, as well as four constituents.  Pelosi said in her own statement that the House's position on remote voting by proxy during a pandemic "is fully consistent with the Constitution is supported by expert legal analyses. Further, the Supreme Court made clear over a century ago that the Constitution empowers each chamber of Congress to set its own procedural rules." The move to proxy voting is the most significant change to the way the House votes since it installed its system to allow electronic voting on the House floor in 1973.  For weeks, lawmakers debated the plan as the pandemic worsened and forced the House to extend its recess in the midst of an outbreak on Capitol Hill and as public health risks were assessed. House Democrats installed the new rules on a largely party line vote of 217 to 189. Republican argued that the move bucks the chamber's institutional history and sets a dangerous precedent. On Wednesday, the House Rules Committee is slated to hold the chamber's first remote hearing under the new rules. Each panel must hold a practice hearing, followed by two virtual sessions. Once those steps are completed, a panel can hold a markup by video conference as well.  The House Ways and Means Committee is also slated to hold its first remote hearing later Wednesday.  At this time, the panels can use Cisco Webex to hold the virtual hearings.  For much of the past two months, the chamber's regular business largely came to a halt, and has since only held a handful of votes related to coronavirus legislation. The chamber's meeting of what is now 431 members and additional support staff have proved particularly problematic amid the coronavirus pandemic. 
                Candidate Donald Trump makes a dramatic entrance on the first night of the 2016 Republican National Convention in Cleveland. His campaign hopes to replicate the scale of that event to demonstrate a recovery from the coronavirus pandemic.

             Candidate Donald Trump makes a dramatic entrance on the first night of the 2016 Republican National Convention in Cleveland. His campaign hopes to replicate the scale of that event to demonstrate a recovery from the coronavirus pandemic. President Trump wants an arena full of tens of thousands of excited Republicans in Charlotte this summer for the party's national convention. But the coronavirus is causing a lot of uncertainty, and North Carolina Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper hasn't been able to make assurances that such a gathering will be possible in August.  So, Trump picked a fight with Cooper in a series of tweets over the holiday weekend, demanding that he commit to allowing "full attendance" in Charlotte's Spectrum Center, a 17,000-seat arena where the convention is set to be held, and Trump followed it up on Tuesday afternoon with a deadline.  "We have to know, yeah, I would say within a week that certainly we have to know," Trump said in answer to a question from a reporter. "Now if he can't do it. If he feels that he's not going to do it all he has to do is tell us and then we have to pick another location and I will tell you a lot of locations want it." Trump now has Republican governors in other states lining up as alternative convention hosts, three months before the big event.  North Carolina is operating in phase two of its reopening plan, with any groups advised to be limited under 10 people while inside. It's not clear what phase the state will be in come Aug. 24, when the Republican National Convention is scheduled to begin.  Cooper has said North Carolina is guided by public health and nothing else and is waiting for the RNC to provide a plan laying out how it would safely hold its convention.  "I'm not surprised by anything that I see on Twitter," Cooper said on Tuesday about the president's comments. "I will say that it's OK for political conventions to be political, but pandemic response cannot be."  
                The Spectrum Center in Uptown Charlotte, N.C., was selected as the site of the 2020 Republican National Convention. But it remains unclear if public health officials would allow a large gathering there this summer.

             The Spectrum Center in Uptown Charlotte, N.C., was selected as the site of the 2020 Republican National Convention. But it remains unclear if public health officials would allow a large gathering there this summer. Before the pandemic, the Republican Party planned for a convention that would draw 50,000 party activists, elected officials and press to the Charlotte area. And as recently as last Friday, GOP Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said they were still planning for a big gathering, but would be waiting for late June or early July to see what the public health situation looked like at that point.  "We've hired a safety expert," she told the news site The 19th. "We're now working to make sure that we are putting contingencies together that we can, to put the safety of our convention goers first and foremost, but a lot of it is going to frankly come down to guidance from the governor and the mayor."  Then came the tweets from Trump, and McDaniel's tone changed. "We want to have it in North Carolina, the president loves North Carolina. It's just the governor, and he's got to work with us" McDaniel said on Fox and Friends. "This governor is up for reelection, he hasn't given us the assurances we need. We need to be able to move forward in a concrete way," she added.  Trump's threat to move the convention, combined with a suggestion from Vice President Pence in an appearance on Fox News that they would look to states that were further along in their reopening, like Texas, Florida or Georgia, set off a flurry of tweets and statements.  Gov. Brian Kemp, R-Ga., tweeted Tuesday, tagging the president's account, "With world-class facilities, restaurants, hotels, and workforce, Georgia would be honored to safely host the Republican National Convention."  With world-class facilities, restaurants, hotels, and workforce, Georgia would be honored to safely host the Republican National Convention. We hope you will consider the Peach State, @realdonaldtrump! Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican Trump ally, told reporters his state would love to have the convention in Florida.  "We've let the folks at the White House know that we want to work with them, and we think that would be a good thing to do," DeSantis said. "So he knows that, and I know key people in his administration and in his campaign know that." The governor listed four major Florida cities he said could easily handle the convention.  But one of those cities, at least, isn't jumping at the chance. Miami Beach Mayor Dan Gelber, a Democrat, says his city is following the guidelines put out by the CDC and a big in-person convention is hard to imagine at the moment.  "I don't know how you commit today to doing something in two months where you don't know what the situation is going to be," Gelber told NPR. "You don't know whether or not you're gonna need to have proper social distancing with masks and all the other accouterments that we've been told we have to follow."  Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, also a Democrat, said in a statement the city is following CDC guidelines for a phased reopening. "That plan does not contemplate hosting a large gathering event in August," the statement said. "In fact, several long-standing City-supported and sponsored events have already been canceled in order to comply with CDC guidelines." Meanwhile, Jacksonville, Fla., Mayor Lenny Curry, a Republican, sent out a multi-tweet pitch for his city, pointing to the UFC fight it recently hosted. 2. We would be honored to host the Republican National Convention in that same world class facility. Thankfully, @GovRonDeSantis and my administration have created a regulatory framework that operates in way that is attractive to significant events like these. For President Trump, who is constantly thinking like a TV producer, a convention is the ultimate showcase. In 2016, he walked on stage dramatically back-lit for effect with Queen's "We Are The Champions" blaring.  This year, his campaign sees holding a big, in-person event as particularly symbolic. "This is an opportunity for America to see that we are coming back from this coronavirus pandemic, we are open again, and we can get back to work, get back to our lives, celebrate freedom, and do so in a way that also respects public health," said Marc Lotter, director of strategic communications for the Trump campaign. Moving a convention isn't unprecedented, but it's been a long time. The last such change in plans came in 1972, when Republicans switched from San Diego to Miami Beach to avoid a controversy. But conventions have gotten vastly more complicated since then.  Planning for Charlotte has been going on for many months, according to Bill Harris, who has led or been involved with Republican convention planning going back to the 1980s. He's retired now, but told NPR he'd expect the plans are already in place for lodging, transportation and security for the massive event. Moving it would be a challenge.  "You could do it, but the closer you get to the event itself, I mean, the harder it gets to do," he said.  Watching on TV, a convention can just look like a big rally, but it is so much more than that. It's a significant logistical undertaking, bringing together thousands of delegates to conduct official party business, in addition to packaging a campaign message for the presidential candidate over several nights. Harris says decisions need to be made very soon, because the convention is set to kick off in less than three months. Of course, as most Americans know all too well right now, long-term planning is nearly impossible in the face of an unpredictable and, at least in modern times, unprecedented pandemic.

             From left: Comedians Natasha Chandel, Abdullah Afzal and Mariam Sobh. They each performed a set during the Socially Distant Eid Comedy Night Special, a virtual event hosted by the Concordia Forum. Performing on a Facebook livestream, Salma Hindy began her stand-up routine by giving a shout-out to everyone in the audience who was following the guidelines to keep the coronavirus at bay, such as washing hands regularly, covering one's face and keeping a respectful distance from others. Though, as a Muslim, she found these habits a tad familiar. "You call it coronavirus, I call it sharia law!" said Hindy, referring to the set of principles Muslims abide by. The Canadian Muslim comedian was one of 40 performers taking part in The Socially Distant Eid Comedy Night, an event hosted by the Concordia Forum, a networking organization for Muslim influencers and changemakers. The goal was to give Muslims around the world some comic relief as they do the unprecedented: celebrate Ramadan and Eid in isolation at home, with fewer family members and friends than usual because of the coronavirus pandemic. A holy month typically observed by attending daily prayers at the mosque and dinner parties to break the dawn-to-dusk fast, Ramadan was indeed a different sight to behold this year, as was Eid al-Fitr, the holiday that marks the end of Ramadan. The stand-up comedians come from different occupations and backgrounds, including award-winning performers based in South Africa and the U.K. Their show was livestreamed on May 24, Eid day for many countries. The event is available to watch on the Concordia Forum's Facebook page until Wednesday at 5 p.m. ET. Muddassar Ahmed, organizer of the event and chair of the Concordia Forum, put together the comedy special during the week leading up to the holiday.  "For the hour or two that people tune in I hope it lifts people's spirits and helps them take their mind off things," says Ahmed. Each comedian did a 3-minute set, poking fun at themselves and making jokes about Muslim stereotypes. Hindy's act revolved around dealing with the coronavirus as a Muslim daughter of immigrants. She mentioned the new degree a lot of parents seem to have gained during the pandemic — a PhD from WhatsApp University. "In WhatsApp University, absolutely no fact-checking is allowed," said Hindy, referring to the habit of some Muslim parents to forward myths and unproven coronavirus cures on WhatsApp, a social messaging app especially popular among immigrants as well as in many countries around the world. Yaaseen Barnes, a South African stand-up comedian and one of several hosts for the evening, found some pros in celebrating Eid under quarantine. He joked that he no longer had to deal with the issue of praying next to someone who occasionally releases smelly burps of the food they just ate at iftar, the meal to break the daily fast. "This is why [Zoom] is great, because you don't need to be in the burp," said Barnes, who is known as the "king of one-liners" by the stand-up community in South Africa. Barnes was delighted to take part in the event and described it as a combination of what he loves: making others laugh and helping people. He hoped he could create a sense of community for those celebrating without family. "Maybe we can give you something to laugh about and make everyone feel a little bit at home," said Barnes. And it wasn't the only virtual event on the holy month calendar. Imam Suhaib Webb, a resident scholar at the Islamic Center at New York University, says that throughout Ramadan, the internet was chock-full of more spiritual-oriented events and gatherings than anyone could attend — a way of keeping the communal spirit alive. ICNYU held virtual events for both iftar and suhoor, the meal before the fast, as well as online lectures about the blessings of Ramadan. Webb believes that, despite the lack of in-person interaction, the online events actually gave people more options to participate in the community aspect of Ramadan and Eid. "It's ironic because, though we're limited in our physical engagement due to the pandemic, we are unlimited in the [virtual] events and things we can participate in," says Webb, referring to the countries that restricted physical gatherings. The virtual comedy show indeed brought many people across nations together, with an estimated 5,000 people tuning in, according to Ahmed, throughout the two-hour event. The social media responses were overwhelming positive, with one writer calling the show "top-tier comedy." And even though I was covering this event as a reporter for NPR, I couldn't help but agree. I'm a Muslim American, and the jokes and online community generated by the comedy special — while no match for the traditional in-person events — gave us back a little bit of the Eid feeling we were missing this year.

             Sen. Kelly Loeffler, R-Ga., leaves after a virtual Senate Committee for Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions hearing on May 12. The Justice Department has closed investigations into stock sales made by three senators shortly before financial markets tanked because of the coronavirus pandemic, according to an individual familiar with the matter. Sens. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.; Kelly Loeffler, R-Ga.; and James Inhofe, R-Okla., were notified of the decision on Tuesday. The Justice Department's insider-trading investigation into another senator, North Carolina Republican Richard Burr, remains open, the individual said. The person asked not to be identified discussing the politically sensitive cases, which were first reported by The Wall Street Journal. The Justice Department declined to comment. All four lawmakers came under scrutiny after making stock trades worth hundreds of thousands of dollars in late January and early February — before markets collapsed as the public became fully aware of the scale of the threat from the coronavirus.  The senators had received briefings on the virus before they made the transactions, which fueled questions about whether they were trading on non-public information. All the senators involved have denied any wrongdoing.  Feinstein, Loeffler and Inhofe have said others, including family members or investment advisers, made the trades on their behalf. A spokesperson for Loeffler called the news a "clear exoneration" that "affirms what Senator Loeffler has said all along—she did nothing wrong." There was no immediate comment from Feinstein or Inhofe.  Senator Burr Burr's trades, which were worth up to $1.7 million, have drawn the most scrutiny, and he remains under investigation.  The FBI executed a search warrant for his cellphone earlier this month — a major step in the probe. It meant investigators were able to show a federal judge probable cause that a crime had been committed and that there was likely evidence of that crime on Burr's phone. The decision to seek a warrant was approved at the highest levels of the Justice Department given the sensitivities involved in an investigation into a sitting senator. Burr has denied any wrongdoing and says he is cooperating with the investigation.  Burr has said he based his trading decisions off public reports about the effects of the coronavirus inside China, where it originated, and not information to which he was privy because of his position. Still, he announced earlier this month he would step aside as chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee until the investigation concludes.

             Memorial Day weekend at Robert Moses State Park on Fire Island, N.Y. As the pandemic continues, Harvard's Dr. Ashish Jha says, mask wearing, social distancing and robust strategies of testing and contact tracing will be even more important. The bleak milestone the U.S. is about to hit — 100,000 deaths from COVID-19 — is far above the number of deaths seen from the pandemic in any other country. So far, the impact of the coronavirus has been felt unevenly, striking certain cities and regions and particular segments of society much harder than others. To get a sense of how that may change, and where in the course of the epidemic the U.S. is right now, NPR's Morning Edition host David Greene spoke Tuesday with Dr. Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute and professor of health policy at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Their conversation has been edited for length and clarity. As you look at this number looming now, what are you reflecting on? Well, a couple of things. First of all, it is a solemn moment to reflect on the idea that about 100,000 Americans have died — mostly just in the last two months. The speed with which this has happened is really devastating. Of course, we've had very little opportunity to mourn all those losses because most of us have been shut down. And I've been thinking about where we go into the future and fall and reminding myself and others that we're early in this outbreak. We're not anywhere near done. The U.S. ... has had more deaths than any country in the world. Do you think that the country is absorbing the significance of these numbers? I think for a majority of Americans, this doesn't quite feel real because the deaths have been concentrated in [a] few places. Obviously, New York has been hit very hard, and some other places like Seattle, Chicago — some of the big cities. And so people who don't live in those areas may not be absorbing it. But the nature of this pandemic is that it starts and kind of accelerates in big cities, but then it moves out into the suburbs and into the rural areas. So, by the time we're done with this, I think every American will have felt it much more up close and personal. That's what I worry about — that it shouldn't have to take that for people to really understand how tragic this is and how calamitous in many ways this is. Q: We're coming out of Memorial Day weekend, and we saw many regulations relaxed in many parts of the country. As you were watching that, what are you predicting in terms of what we could see by the end of summer? If you look at all of the models out there — and most models have been relatively accurate — a few of them have been too optimistic. But then, if you sort of look at the models of models — the ones that really sort of combine it all and put it together and make projections — the projections are that we're probably going to see 70,000 to 100,000 deaths between now and the end of the summer. While the pace will slow down, because we are doing some amount of social distancing and testing is ramping up — we're going to, unfortunately, see a lot more sickness and, unfortunately, a lot more deaths in the upcoming months. Q: There's been talk of a seasonal aspect to this. Whatever happens over the summer, do we face even more deaths as we head later in the year? Yes. I'm hoping that the models of the summer of an additional 70,000 to 100,000 deaths are too pessimistic. And they may be, because we may get a seasonal benefit because of the summer: People are outside more. But the flip side of the seasonal benefit of the summer is what will almost surely be a pretty tough fall and winter with a surge of cases — a wave that might be bigger than the wave we just went through. And we've got to prepare for that, because we can't be caught flat-footed the way we were this time around. Q: What can we do to prepare? We're seeing so many states relax restrictions right now. Is it a matter of potentially putting those restrictions back in place where they need to be? Or are there other things we could be doing? There are two things that I would say. First of all, people can't be locked down for the rest of this pandemic. I understand that people need to get out, and being outside is a good thing. But we have to maintain a certain amount of social distancing. I think mask wearing is really important. The only other tool we have in our toolbox is a really robust testing, tracing, isolation program. You know, if you think about how it is that South Korea and Germany have been able to do much, much better? They have had a really aggressive testing, tracing, isolation program. We know that works. It allows us to kind of have more of our lives back without the number of deaths that we've suffered. So I really think that still remains — and should remain — one of our priority areas. Q: The federal government's new strategic testing plan calls on states to take a lot of the responsibility for testing. ... Do you see that as the best approach? I think this is a real missed opportunity and very unfortunate in many ways, because while states have a critical role to play, testing capacity and testing supply chains are national and international. We don't want 50 states competing. We want a federal strategy that helps states. And I'm worried that we're just not getting that from the federal government.

             Keri Belcher, who has worked in the oil and gas industry, says she's considering switching careers — even if it means less time outdoors, which is what attracted her to geology in the first place. Geologist Keri Belcher had a moment of relief earlier this year. Her employer, a medium-sized oil and gas company, had a round of layoffs — and she made it through. She still had a job. Then came the coronavirus and the complete collapse in oil prices. This time around, she was laid off. "It was kind of unfortunate, too, because I just re-signed my apartment lease," the Houston resident said. Belcher applied for unemployment, and after seven weeks of waiting, still hadn't received a single check. She's applied for jobs, with no luck. She's looking for someone to take over the lease on that apartment. FACES OF THE CORONAVIRUS RECESSION Jobs lost. Businesses in peril. Meetings gone virtual. Faces Of The Coronavirus Recession offers snapshots of working lives upended by the pandemic. And like many other people stuck inside, she's taken up new hobbies — like drawing and baking bread. "I got a nice crunchy crust the other day," she says. "Very exciting." What comes next? She's not sure. Her career was just getting off the ground, and she's not expecting the oil and gas industry to go on a hiring spree any time soon. Besides, it's a boom-and-bust industry even in the best of times. "I'm just wondering to myself, do I really want to go through this five years from now or another 10 years from now?" she asks. "So — I don't know." Maybe a complete career switch is in order. Even if it means less time outdoors, which is what attracted her to geology in the first place. But what else could she do with her oil and gas experience and a master's degree in geology? Data analytics, perhaps? She's discovered she's not the only one asking that question. "I guess I'm just a little lost," she says. Read more stories in Faces Of The Coronavirus Recession.

             With physician offices not seeing patients with COVID-19 symptoms in April, Timothy Regan said he had little choice when Denver Health directed him first to its urgent care facility and then to its emergency room. "I felt bad, but I had been dealing with it for a while," he says. From late March into April, Timothy Regan had severe coughing fits several times a day that often left him out of breath. He had a periodic low-grade fever too. Wondering if he had COVID-19, Regan called a nurse hotline run by Denver Health, a large public health system in his city. A nurse listened to him describe his symptoms and told him to immediately go to the hospital system's urgent care facility. When he arrived at Denver Health — where the emergency room and urgent care facility sit side by side at its main location downtown — a nurse directed him to the ER after he noted chest pain as one of his symptoms. Regan was seen quickly and given a chest X-ray and electrocardiogram, known as an EKG, to check his lungs and heart. Both were normal. A doctor prescribed an inhaler to help his breathing and told him he might have bronchitis. The doctor advised that he had to presume he had COVID-19 and must quarantine at home for two weeks. At the time, on April 3, Denver Health reserved COVID-19 tests for sicker patients. Two hours after arriving at the hospital, Regan was back home. His longest wait was for his inhaler prescription to be filled. Share your medical billing story Do you have a medical bill you'd like us to investigate? You can tell us about it and submit it here. Regan wasn't concerned about just his own health. His wife, Elissa, who is expecting their second child in August, and their 1-year-old son, Finn, also felt sick with symptoms like those of COVID-19 in April. "Nothing terrible but enough to make me worry," he said. Regan, who is an estimator for a construction firm, worked from home throughout his sickness — including while quarantined. (Construction in Colorado and many states has been considered an essential business and has continued to operate.) Regan said he was worried about taking a day off and losing his job. "I was thinking I had to make all the money I could in case we all had to be hospitalized," he said. "All I could do was keep working in hopes that everything would be OK." Within a couple of weeks, the whole family indeed was OK. "We got lucky," Elissa said. Then the bill came. The patient: Timothy Regan, 40, an estimator for a construction company. The family has health insurance through Elissa's job at a nonprofit in Denver. Total bill: Denver Health billed Regan $3,278 for the ER visit. His insurer paid $1,042, leaving him with $2,236 to pay based on his $3,500 in-network deductible. The biggest part of the bill was the $2,921 general ER fee. Service provider: Denver Health, a large public health system Medical service: Regan was evaluated in the emergency room for COVID-19-like symptoms, including a severe cough, fever and chest pain. He was given several tests to check his heart and lungs, prescribed an inhaler and sent home. What gives: When patients use hospital emergency rooms — even for short visits with few tests — it's not unusual for them to get billed thousands of dollars no matter how minor the treatment received. Hospitals say the high fees come from having to staff the ER with specialists 24 hours a day and keep lifesaving equipment up to date. Denver Health coded Timothy's ER visit as a Level 4 — the second highest and second most expensive — on a 5-point scale. The other items on his bill were $225 for the EKG, $126 for the chest X-ray and $6 for his albuterol inhaler, a medication that provides quick relief for breathing problems. The Regans knew they had a high deductible, and they try to avoid unnecessarily using the ER. But with physician offices not seeing patients with COVID-19 symptoms in April, Timothy said he had little choice when Denver Health directed him first to its urgent care and then to its ER. "I felt bad, but I had been dealing with it for a while," he said. Elissa said they were trying hard to do everything by the book, including using a health provider in their plan's network. "We did not anticipate being hit with such a huge bill for the visit," Elissa said. "We had intentionally called the nurse's line trying to be responsible, but that did not work." In an effort to remove barriers to people getting tested and evaluated for COVID-19, UnitedHealthcare is one of many insurers that announced it will waive cost sharing for COVID-19 testing-related visits and treatment. But it is not clear how many people who had COVID-19 symptoms but who did not get tested when tests were in short supply have been billed as the Regans were. Resolution: A Denver Health spokesperson said Regan was not tested for COVID-19 because he was not admitted and did not have risk factors such as diabetes, heart disease or asthma. He was not billed as a COVID-19 patient because he was not tested for the virus. The medical center has since expanded its testing capacity, the spokesperson said. UnitedHealthcare officials reviewed Regan's case at the request of Kaiser Health News. Based on Regan's symptoms and the tests performed, Denver Health should have billed them using a COVID-19 billing code, an insurer spokesperson said. "We reprocessed Mr. Regan's original claims after reviewing the services that he received," a UnitedHealthcare spokesperson said. "All cost share for that visit has been waived." 
                Timothy and Elissa Regan say they try to avoid needlessly visiting the ER because of their high-deductible insurance plan. Denver Health billed $3,278 for Timothy's ER visit.

             Timothy and Elissa Regan say they try to avoid needlessly visiting the ER because of their high-deductible insurance plan. Denver Health billed $3,278 for Timothy's ER visit. The Regans said they were thrilled with UHC's decision. "That is wonderful news," Elissa said upon hearing from a KHN reporter that UHC would waive their costs. "We are very thankful. It is a huge relief." The takeaway: The Regans said they initially found no satisfaction in calling the hospital or the insurer to resolve their dispute — but it was the right thing to do. "He's definitely not alone," said Sabrina Corlette, a research professor at Georgetown University's Center on Health Insurance Reforms. "The takeaway here is both the provider as well as insurance company are still on a learning curve with respect to this virus and how to bill and pay for it." Corlette said Timothy should not have second-guessed his decision to use the Denver Health ER when directed there by a nurse. That, too, was the right call. Insurers' move to waive costs associated with COVID-19 testing and related treatment is vital to stem the outbreak — but it works only if patients can trust they won't get stuck with a large bill, she said. "It's a critical piece of the public health strategy to beat this disease," Corlette said. To help with billing, she said, patients could ask their provider to note on their medical chart when they seek care for a possible case of COVID-19. But it's not patients' responsibility to make sure providers use the right billing code, she said. Patients need to know they have rights to appeal costs to their insurer. They can also seek assistance from their employer's benefits department and state insurance department.

             Christian (left) and his wife Monze (right) were laid off from restaurant jobs in mid-March and not qualified to receive unemployment because they are undocumented immigrants. California's first-of-its-kind effort to get cash aid into the hands of undocumented workers affected by the coronavirus got off to a bumpy start over the past week.  Across the state, tens of thousands of immigrants calling to apply encountered busy signals, crashed phone lines and frustration.  "People are desperate right now," says Christopher Martinez, the chief program officer for Catholic Charities of the East Bay, "that's why they're reaching out. And they're very worried that these funds will run out quickly. But we're just asking people to keep trying." Catholic Charities is one of a dozen nonprofit and immigrant rights groups the state of California has partnered with to try to reach workers who are living here illegally. Many are doing work that qualifies as an essential work, but their status makes them ineligible for federal pandemic relief as well as most state and local relief.  "They were providing valuable services to our community and, because of the pandemic, essentially they're at zero income right now," says Martinez. "They were day care providers, house cleaners, providing painting or general contract work."   Applicants must meet certain criteria. For those who are approved, the program offers a direct cash payment of $500 per adult, $1,000 max per family.   Because of virus-related health concerns, as well as deportation fears, there are no in-person or online applications for the aid money. It's almost all processed electronically and through phone lines. Callers often have no ability to leave phone messages, so the lines so far have been consistently overloaded.  "I dial and dial and dial and I get a busy signal," says Jaime, an immigrant from El Salvador, who did not want his last name used because of his status. "I feel like the opportunity goes away every day, the funds are running lower every day, and no one picks up my call." The funds are being doled out on a first-come, first-served basis until the taxpayer-funded $75 million pot of money runs out. A group of foundations and private donors called Grantmakers Concerned with Immigrants and Refugees pledged an additional $50 million in direct financial aid to families of undocumented immigrants.   Jaime says his wife and two children, ages 8 and 5, are scared. He works construction in Southern California installing heating and air-conditioning units. He says he's paid per installation, but since March, work had been sporadic. Two weeks ago, it stopped.    His children are U.S. citizens and they qualify for food stamps and some other aid, but not for federal coronavirus relief funds because they are children of undocumented workers. Jaime says he has never before asked for government assistance.  "I've always provided with my own work," he says, proudly. But he worries about what will happen as the pandemic wears on. "I don't know what I'll do, but I know it will get much harder for me." The state of California is working with groups already known and trusted in these communities by people whose immigration status can make them fearful of authorities.  A consortium of Bay Area Catholic Charities is responsible for implementing the program in the broader region. It has averaged nearly 200,000 calls a day, so far. On several days, the call volume crashed lines. The group has just 100 people answering phones.  "It really speaks to how enormous the need is," Martinez says. "Even if we had 500 agents ready to answer calls, we simply wouldn't be able to get to everybody." Overloaded phone lines aren't the only obstacle. Some applicants don't have access to computers. Others weren't comfortable downloading apps on their phones.  "Part of the challenge of this process in distributing disaster relief funding is the fact that we do have to walk folks through a process to be able to utilize their phones to get us documents or data" and to use their mobile phones for e-signatures, says Diana Tellefson-Torres who is the executive director of the United Farm Workers Foundation, a grassroots organization that's processing and evaluating aid applications in the Central Valley. "That is adding more time to serve folks over the phone."  She and her staff often advise applicants with limited tech experience to enlist the help of their teenage children or someone else in the household who is more tech-savvy.  Despite the challenges, immigrants are getting help. For example, in the first week, Bay Area groups have processed more than 2,500 cash cards worth more than $1.2 million, says spokeswoman Mary Kuhn with Catholic Charities. California Department of Social Services spokesman Jason Montiel declined to answer questions about the program and its rocky rollout. In an emailed statement, Montiel said only that, "The 12 nonprofits are receiving a high number of inquiries and are working as quickly as possible to respond to people applying for assistance on a first come, first served basis. Nonprofits are working to set up additional phone lines for expanded capacity."  The scramble is part of a basic math problem: There's only enough aid money for 250,000 people. But there are an estimated 2 million workers in the state illegally, potentially leaving some 1.75 million people in need without aid.  "We have been hearing the needs and the trauma and the stress from our undocumented community since the pandemic rolled out, asking what would happen to them if they would get  sick," says Luz Gallegos, the community program director at TODEC Legal Center based in Perris, Calif., one of the nonprofits processing applications.  Gallegos concedes that $500 may not cover all expenses, but applicants tell her they'll use the money to buy food or medications, pay a phone bill or use it for transportation.   "It's been very emotional just to hear folks who have gone through the process and just be so thankful," Gallegos says.  California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced the program in April, saying he felt a deep sense of gratitude to undocumented immigrants who "are still in fear of deportation, but are still addressing the essential needs of tens of millions of Californians." California officials say undocumented immigrants paid more than $2.5 billion in state and local taxes last year.  The overwhelming demand this week has prompted some charities to call for a second round of state funding. That's unlikely given the state's enormous budget woes in the pandemic's wake.   The program has also accelerated efforts by nonprofits to boost their own fundraising for immigrants in need.   A conservative group had sued the state to try to stop taxpayer funds going to undocumented immigrants. The state Supreme Court dismissed the lawsuit.

             Health care workers protest hospital understaffing and insufficient personal protective equipment last week outside Providence St. Joseph Medical Center in Burbank, Calif. When President Trump took office in 2017, his team stopped work on new federal regulations that would have forced the health care industry to prepare for an airborne infectious disease pandemic such as COVID-19. That decision is documented in federal records reviewed by NPR. "If that rule had gone into effect, then every hospital, every nursing home would essentially have to have a plan where they made sure they had enough respirators and they were prepared for this sort of pandemic," said David Michaels, who was head of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration  until January 2017.  There are still no specific federal regulations protecting health care workers from deadly airborne pathogens such as influenza, tuberculosis or the coronavirus. This fact hit home during the last respiratory pandemic, the H1N1 outbreak in 2009. Thousands of Americans died and dozens of health care workers got sick. At least four nurses died.  Studies conducted after the H1N1 crisis found voluntary federal safety guidelines designed to limit the spread of airborne pathogens in medical facilities often weren't being followed. There were also shortages of personal protective equipment.  "H1N1 made it very clear OSHA did not have adequate standards for airborne transmission and contact transmission, and so we began writing a standard to do that," Michaels said. HIV/AIDS rule set the standard for protecting workers OSHA experts were confident new airborne infectious disease regulations would make hospitals and nursing homes safer when future pandemics hit. That's because similar rules had already been created for bloodborne pathogens such as Ebola and hepatitis.  Those rules, implemented during the HIV/AIDS epidemic, forced the health care industry to adopt safety plans and buy more equipment designed to protect staff and patients.  But making a new infectious disease regulation, affecting much of the American health care system, is time-consuming and contentious.  It requires lengthy consultation with scientists, doctors and other state and federal regulatory agencies as well as the nursing home and hospital industries that would be forced to implement the standard. Federal records reviewed by NPR show OSHA went step by step through that process for six years, and by early 2016 the new infectious disease rule was ready. The Obama White House formally added it to a list of regulations scheduled to be implemented in 2017.  Then came the presidential election. An emphasis on deregulation In the spring of 2017, the Trump team formally stripped OSHA's airborne infectious disease rule from the regulatory agenda. NPR could find no indication the new administration had specific policy concerns about the infectious disease rules.  Instead, the decision appeared to be part of a wider effort to cut regulations and bureaucratic oversight.  "Earlier this year we set a target of adding zero new regulatory costs onto the American economy," Trump said in December 2017. "As a result, the never-ending growth of red tape in America has come to a sudden, screeching and beautiful halt." The impact on the federal effort to protect health care workers from diseases such as COVID-19 was immediate.  "The infectious disease standard was put on the back burner. Work stopped," said Michaels, now a professor at George Washington University.

             A medical worker is assisted into personal protective equipment on May 8 before stepping into a patient's room in the COVID-19 intensive care unit at Harborview Medical Center in Seattle. A deadly escalation of the H1N1 crisis This spring, hospitals and nursing homes found themselves facing much of the same crisis they experienced during the H1N1 outbreak, with many facilities unprepared and unequipped. Only this time the scale was larger and deadlier.  The federal government reports that at least 43,000 front-line health care workers have gotten sick, many infected, while caring for COVID-19 patients in facilities where personal protective equipment was being rationed.  "Even just a few months ago, I couldn't have imagined that I would have been on a Zoom call reading out the names of registered nurses who have died on the front lines of a pandemic," said Bonnie Castillo, who heads the National Nurses United union.  "The memorial was not only about grief. It was also about anger." OSHA's infectious disease rule debated in Washington Castillo said Congress should immediately implement the infectious disease regulations shelved by the Trump administration as an emergency rule before a second wave of the coronavirus hits.   "Which obviously would mandate that employers have the highest level of PPE, not the lowest," she said. Democrats in the House of Representatives passed a bill in mid-May that would do so, but the Republican-controlled Senate has blocked the measure, and the White House still opposes the rules.  The Trump administration hasn't responded to NPR's repeated inquiries about the infectious disease rule. But in a briefing call with lawmakers this month, the current head of OSHA, Loren Sweatt, argued enough rules are already in place to protect workers.  "We have mandatory standards related to personal protective equipment and bloodborne pathogens and sanitation standards," Sweatt said in a recording provided to NPR. "We have existing standards that can address this area." The hospital industry also opposes the new safety rules. Nancy Foster with the American Hospital Association said voluntary guidelines for airborne pandemics are adequate.   "You're right; they're not regulations, but they are the guidance that we want to follow," Foster said. "They set forth the expectation for infection control, so in a sense they're just like regulations." But the infectious disease standard would have required the health care industry to do far more. It sets out specific standards for planning and training. It would also have forced facilities to stockpile personal protective equipment to handle "surges" of sick patients such as the ones seen with COVID-19.  NPR also found the lack of fixed regulations allowed the Trump administration to relax worker safety guidelines. Federal agencies did so repeatedly this spring as COVID-19 spread and shortages of personal protective equipment worsened.  As a consequence, hospitals could say they were meeting federal guidelines while requiring doctors and nurses to reuse masks and protective gowns after exposure to sick patients.

             Cathy Cody is owner/operator of No Ifs Ands Or Butts About It Janitorial Services & More, LLC in Albany, Ga. On a Tuesday morning in Albany, Ga., Cathy Cody is walking through the empty hallways of a home left vacant by COVID-19. "Right now, I'm standing in a home we started on, packing up their loved one's belongings because that's all they have left," Cody says during a Facebook Live video. She's stacked U-Haul boxes on the carpeting, filled with shoes, clothes, perfume bottles and purses — every last item she'll haul into storage. It's a somber glimpse into the final days before the virus took a person's life. "You can see how the person was trying to, I guess, maintain," Cody says in an interview with NPR. "But they succumbed to the coronavirus." Boxing these possessions is part of her job now. Cody runs a cleaning business in Albany called No Ifs Ands Or Butts About It Janitorial Services & More, LLC, and since the pandemic began, a handful of clients have called on her after losing family members to COVID-19. Cody found a way to help, and she calls the service Boxed With Love. She hopes she can help take a little weight off families suffering through this devastating pandemic. She suits up in white Tyvek coveralls, goggles, gloves and a face mask. As she enters the homes, she and her team use a fogger machine to spray a mist of disinfectant before beginning the deep clean. "The families we have been assisting are people I know," Cody says. "People that we went to church with, people that we've hugged and told we love. It's heartbreaking." Albany is the biggest city in Dougherty County, a three hour drive south from Atlanta. The close-knit, predominantly African American community of almost 90,000 has seen one of the nation's highest rates of COVID-19. According to the Georgia Department of Public Health, over 1,730 of the county's residents have tested positive for the coronavirus and at least 140 people have died. State health officials point to a pair of funerals in Albany held in late February and early March that sparked the outbreak. Michael Fowler of the Dougherty County Coroner's Office told Time magazine, "It just went like wildfire. It was just like a bomb went off here." The unimaginable and sudden loss caused by this virus is an eerily familiar pain for Cody, whose son was murdered on June 11, 2017. Anthony Wright, 21, was shot and killed outside an apartment complex when he tried to stop an attack on his older sister. Cody remembers standing outside his closet. "The only thing I had left was his clothing, his shoes, his cap and gown. He had this Levi's jacket, it was green, and his scent was still in the coat," she says. "We buried him on his 22nd birthday." In the days and weeks following his death, she says rummaging through her son's closet was the hardest part. "I remember grabbing hold to his clothing and I remember just screaming and crying to the top of my lungs, 'God, if you don't help me, I don't know what to do.' And I remember waking up the next day, in the living room, on the floor, on the pile of clothes that I had pulled out of the closet," she says. "Because that was it. That's all I had." The sharp memory of trauma drives her mission behind Boxed With Love, a service she dedicates to her son. "She eased a lot of the burden off me," says Teri Franklin of Albany. "She's a godsend, honestly." Franklin lost both of her parents to COVID-19. Her mother died on March 25, and then, just over three weeks later, her father died on April 18. "I was very close with my mom and dad, we talked every day," Franklin says. "I would've never thought that I would be burying my parents two weeks in-between each other. Married for 46 years." Marjorie Franklin, a retired seamstress, was 66. Nathaniel Franklin, who celebrated his retirement last June, was 65. Both of her parents died in hospitals. Teri Franklin says the moment she returned to her parents' house, she was surrounded by their memories. "When I walked back in the house, I could smell my mom," she says. "I could smell my mom." She called Cody, who showed up at the Franklin's house with a car full of empty boxes. "You can really see it in these houses. The pictures, the people, their beautiful families," Cody says. "I got to see how [Marjorie] was a family woman. And she loved God and she was a dresser, she loved clothes." "Ms. Cathy had packed up belts, hats, scarves," Franklin says of her parents' belongings. "She took everything out of the drawers, which were my dad's ties; my mom's sewing room and sewing machines; my mom still had shoes that had never been out of the box. [Cathy] packed everything up and put it in storage." Albany is one of many communities across the U.S. pushed to the edge by the coronavirus outbreak. As the state of Georgia continues to reopen, there's lingering uncertainty in Dougherty County about more lives at risk, and whether COVID-19 could make a comeback. Cathy Cody just wants families to know she's still here. "Even in pandemics," she says, "There is hope, there is help, and my God, there sure is God."

             Stephanie Quayle. Congregating in person for concerts is out of the question this spring and for the foreseeable future, so music fans have gotten used to watching performers livestream from home. What's less obvious is that segments of the Nashville music community that work out of view have been equally resourceful in finding virtual stopgaps during lockdown.  In the industry culture of Music City, fully booked and productive work days can have the appearance of neighborly socializing, so it only makes sense that many music-makers would look to shift their standard, three-hour co-writing appointments and studio sessions to videoconferencing in comfy clothes. Among those working this way are Stephanie Quayle, a plucky, expressive country-pop singer and songwriter whose Montana roots make her partial to ranching and rodeoing imagery, and Alex Kline, the conservatory-trained composer and multi-instrumentalist producing Quayle's music. They'd planned to reserve a studio and hire players to record two new songs in April --that, of course, was not to be. By mid-March, Quayle was sheltering with her husband on their working farm in North Carolina and Kline was self-quarantining in her West Nashville bungalow. Together, they pondered how to carry on with the project amidst a pandemic. During a joint phone interview, Kline recalled her reasoning: "Well, I've got more time than I usually do, and I know a lot of musicians that are dying to work right now. All the ones that I use have their own home studio set-ups. So we can still get this done." "It was never, 'Oh, I guess we'll just have to wait.' " Quayle affirmed appreciatively. "It was, 'Let's see what we can do.' I love that sort of mentality." On a Monday afternoon in late April, Quayle and Kline were joined on a Zoom meeting by Christine Hillman, the A&R rep from Quayle's independent label, engineer Aaron Chmielewski and guitarist Adam Shoenfeld, all of them but Quayle in Tennessee. Rather than the standard studio strategy of having an entire group of studio pros lay down their parts at once, this session would single out electric guitar. Before the five got down to business, there was a bit of introductory banter and commiseration about the strange circumstances under which they were convening. "Are you drinking beer down there, Stephanie?" Alex wanted to know. "Kombucha," Quayle corrected, half-grinning, sun streaming through the window behind her, "but it'll soon be something stronger." Realizing that the others probably remembered him as clean-shaven, Shoenfeld lightheartedly acknowledged his quarantine beard. At one point, he spun the camera around to offer a panoramic view of his home studio, with its gold record plaques, gear arsenal and flickering fake candles. "Just so you know, that's how we're rolling," he quipped. Zoom functions reasonably well for business meetings and simulated happy-hour hangs. But with its tinny sound quality and stuttering delays, it's not exactly designed for a professional recording session, where it's imperative for the producer to be able to make out the nuances of the guitarist's performance. The solution, worked out in advance, was that everyone would log on to a separate program, called Audio Movers, that streams audio without getting glitchy. Even so, they were in for a somewhat halting process. Without engineer Chmielewski physically present, Shoenfeld was juggling: He'd reach toward his screen to unmute himself on Zoom, consult with the producer and engineer, turn the app's audio back off again, check the chart he'd made to guide him through a song, cue up the track and, finally, start playing. "I wish I had an engineer," Shoenfeld commented with wistful wryness. "Reach through and press the buttons, would you please?" Stoically monitoring volume levels and tone from his own work space, Chmielewski admitted feeling phantom urges to manipulate the controls: "Every time Adam hits 'stop' and 'play,' I want to do it too." They were working on a broody country-rock tune called "Lone Ranger," whose propulsive rhythm parts were already mostly assembled, some of them played by Kline, and Quayle's scratch vocal, which she'd then replace at a later date.The first thing Shoenfeld added was baritone guitar, whose western-sounding gravitas he knew Quayle favored, strategically positioning his arpeggiated figures and resonant chording to leave room for other textures. He switched guitars for a sinewy rhythm part, then switched again for metal-style lead lines. During a discussion between takes, Kline sang Shoenfeld a lean, pensive counterpoint figure she'd come up with. "Try that for me, if you don't mind," she requested. Shoenfeld mirrored it, asking, "That kind of deal?" He toyed with varying the phrasing, then resumed recording. When he was done, Kline approved: "That's got more flavor to it." Eventually, he executed a swooping, circling lick, punctuated with brisk note-bending. He hadn't seen Quayle register her appreciation of his shredding by playfully crinkling her nose and making devil horns with her hand, so Kline, who'd been texting with Hillman and Quayle while Shoenfeld played, filled him in: "She sent melting faces in the chat." "Okay, good direction, then?" he deduced. He tried again, searching for a smoother ending to his solo, before seeking further direction. "I like a lot of stuff you did on the last one too, when you did a little bit of fancy footwork on the way out," Kline encouraged. "I don't think it was quite the right exit, but yeah, just keep going." Throughout the session, the interactions seemed warm, but more self-conscious and deliberately courteous than normal. Like so many of us who've had to adjust to relying on videoconferencing, it was like they were compensating for the presence of webcams in their faces and the absence of in-person body language. Quayle took notes, bobbed her head in time and, every so often, tiptoed into the conversation between takes: "It sounds awesome. Okay, I'll go back on mute." In our subsequent interview, Quayle laughingly described a conundrum she hadn't anticipated: "What do I do with my hands on camera? I kind of had that moment while Adam's playing his heart out, like, 'Man, I've really gotta make sure that my face doesn't say anything I don't want it to say unintentionally.' " Kline, who gave less away while she listened, welcomed the opportunity to focus on the contributions of one player at a time. "Usually you have five or six players in a room, and it sounds really great — but you're trying to listen to six things go down at once," she explained. "They leave and you're like, 'Okay, now let me see what this really sounds like.' But this way you really get to intently listen to each part go down, which might come out a little bit more thoughtful than usual." During Quayle's virtual songwriting appointment the following week, the attention was also focused differently than it might have been if she and her three co-writers — Tiffany Goss, David Mescon and Bruce Wallace — were all in the same place. Quayle was still in North Carolina; Goss, already friendly with Quayle, sat at her own kitchen table in Nashville, a stainless steel refrigerator behind her; and Wallace and Mescon, who Goss knew and Quayle was meeting for the first time, were set up in separate rooms in Mescon's house. Regular collaborators, Wallace and Mescon were adept at a streamlined, pop-schooled technique — creating a rhythmic instrumental track while simultaneously shaping a melody and lyrics that fit it — that's become as common in Nashville over the last decade as the older way of doing things; recording a bare-bones guitar-and vocal demo of a newly completed song that would be fleshed out, at a separate time, by a full band. The two had prepared a rough idea in advance. "So we started messing with this little track," Wallace told his co-writers. "It's a little feel-good thing. I was just thinking about stuff, like 'We can't be together. We're social distancing.' A covert way of saying all that, making it more of a lost-love song or something. Call it 'Closer To Me'?" Mescon cued up a mellow, mid-tempo bit of music with a brittle beat and a fingerpicked acoustic guitar figure. All four agreed that this was a direction worth pursuing, and Quayle supplied more personalized inspiration. Work travel often kept her and her husband apart, but she was learning more and more about him while they holed up together. "I want it to be for you, Stephanie, but a universal, kind of light, love song?" Goss ventured. "Yeah," Quayle affirmed. "I think that we all assume we know the other person. 'Just when you think you know someone... ' And I'm saying this in a positive light. Like, 'I never thought we would be closer.' " Wallace jumped in with a few poetic lines: "Just when you think you know someone, you find out something else. Sometimes I think I know you better than I know myself." "Are you writing this down?" Quayle inquired enthusiastically. Goss held up a jumbo 2020 calendar, repurposed as a notebook, that she'd been scribbling on with a Sharpie. Quayle offered to capture the rapidly developing verses in a shared Google Doc. Mescon sent them all the latest version of the track, while he continued tweaking its feel and structure and layering on Telecaster and synthesizer. Now that the music was on her phone, Quayle could try singing along with it, testing out a sultry, elongated chorus melody. Later, Wallace came up with punchier phrasing for the vocal hook, and they dropped "closer" from the lyrics in favor of language about reliving the pleasing aspects of a relationship, like a song on loop. When Wallace checked to make sure he'd spelled "repeat" correctly, Goss and Quayle reassured him with their own accounts of spelling difficulties, recalling which words knocked them out of elementary school spelling bees. They also compared notes on their love of dogs. Goss lamented the fact that none of Quayle's farm animals had wandered on camera. "Honestly, I love my animals, but they're so distracting," Quayle chuckled. As the minutes ticked by, there were momentary lulls in conversation while everyone privately pondered how to complete the chorus. "We would have had this song finished 30 minutes ago if we were all in the same place," Goss mused. At the end of three hours, the song was complete enough for Mescon and Wallace to record a demo to document the work they'd done together, even though there might be significant revisions to come, and for Quayle, who Mescon invited to replace Wallace's voice with her own singing, to be validated in her optimism.  She insisted, "We have to do it again in person, though."

Websites that collate the names and photos of the dead. Video projections of those we have lost, shining onto building facades. In the absence of collective public gatherings, people are coming up with new ways to memorialize those who have died from COVID-19. Perhaps the simplest, most essential gesture is to say their names. In a recent 24-hour virtual vigil streamed live on Facebook, volunteers read out thousands of names, in an excruciating litany of loss. Naming the dead has become a familiar ritual in other national tragedies, a recitation usually voiced in large, cathartic public gatherings. This time, the names were read by people sitting alone, in kitchens and bedrooms, looking into a webcam. A tree of loss

             Anne Guynn has draped garlands of more than 3,600 paper hearts on a walnut tree in her family orchard, Ballard Walnut Grove, in Ballard, Calif. Each heart represents one California resident who has died from COVID-19. On a walnut farm in Ballard, Calif., Anne Guynn has created her own personal memorial. Each week, she goes out into her family's orchard, climbs a ladder into one of the walnut trees and hangs garlands of colorful paper hearts she has cut out and strung: one heart for each of the nearly 4,000 Californians who have died from COVID-19. "It looks like a weeping willow a little bit with all of these dangling hearts, and that's appropriate to me," Guynn says. "I'm really very committed to doing this, and I know we probably have a year or more; who knows how long we're going?" For those not directly touched by the virus, Guynn says, "it's easy to feel like it's not really happening, or to disconnect from it. This is a way to say, 'No, it's happening.' And each heart is not just one person, but a whole family connected to that one person who is gone." 
                The bench underneath the tree encourages passersby to sit and reflect. "Each heart is not just one person, but a whole family connected to that one person who is gone," Guynn says.

Guynn and her family have set up a bench under the festooned walnut tree so that people driving by can stop, sit and reflect. "The wind has blown a lot of the hearts off, so they're scattered throughout the orchard, and I'll find little colored hearts everywhere," she says. "We'll be harvesting for years to come, and we'll see hearts come through our harvesting plant, which will be a reminder of what we've all been through."

             In this time of stay-at-home orders and social distancing, our traditions of collective mourning have been upended. We are left to grieve and process loss largely on our own. Projected onto the brick wall of a Subway sandwich shop across the street appeared the words "Covid Memorial." Below them scrolled a slideshow of faces of COVID-19 victims, along with messages their loved ones had posted on social media — messages mourning the loss of their Uncle Rudy, or Auntie Joyce, or cousin Jorel, whose smiling faces flashed into the night, and vanished. Those walking by, like neighborhood residents Sean Powers and Jina Kang, looked up and slowed down to take in the sight.  "There's a whole lot of tragedy that gets blended in the digital platform," Powers said, "and to see this going in your physical space is just a great reminder of the tragedy that we're living in." "I'm seeing COVID-related news all day, which is very depressing," Kang said. "But in a way, seeing this feels like there's a community of support in this neighborhood." That was the hope of the Covid Memorial's creator, Duncan Meisel, who launched the project out of his bedroom in Austin, Texas. It began as a digital archive of remembrances, and then expanded to include public video projections. "There's something powerful about sharing those stories in public, off the Internet, that lends them a little more concreteness than just another post," Meisel says. "Y'know, we're drowning in posts right now." We're drowning in numbers, too, he points out, constantly bombarded with coronavirus statistics, charts, graphs and exhortations to "flatten the curve." Meisel hopes projects like his will reinforce our human connections, and remind us to take the steps needed to keep people safe. "I think it's harder to protect each other when we don't have a shared sense of what we've lost," he says.

In this time of stay-at-home orders and social distancing, our traditions of collective mourning have been upended. We are left to grieve and process loss largely on our own. "In any other major national crisis, we would have a chance to mourn together," Meisel says. "Whether it's been a mass shooting or a terrorist attack, people can get together, they can lay flowers, they can light candles." But now, he says, "we can't be together, and families who are losing people, they can't be together either, with their loved ones. I think that it really creates a deeper sense of trauma and loss, and people are searching for ways to make sense of what is an extremely traumatic event." When Normina Nicotra of Jersey City, N.J., heard about Meisel's project, she submitted a tribute to her mother, Amihilda Menina: a registered nurse for more than 50 years who died of COVID-19 at age 76. "I want so much for people to remember that she's not just a number," Nicotra says, "that she was actually important to so many people."

Nicotra worries that with so much attention focused on the latest coronavirus data, people may lose sight of the individual human toll. "It's just becoming a number for a lot of people," she says, "especially as people are sitting at home getting restless, and are so anxious for the economy to open back up again." Now, as the U.S. death toll approaches 100,000, Nicotra can't stop thinking: What if we had responded sooner? What if the country had sheltered in place right away? "I think about all those unnecessary deaths, and all the families that didn't get to say goodbye to their loved ones, and I think it's a failure," Nicotra says. "I think it's a hundred thousand completely preventable deaths."

             Workers prepare takeout orders May 1 in Houston. For more than two out of three unemployed workers, jobless benefits exceed their old pay, researchers say. That discrepancy can raise awkward questions for workers, bosses and policymakers. Preschool teacher Lainy Morse has been out of work for more than two months.  But the Portland, Ore., child care center where she worked is considering a reopening. Morse says she is dreading the idea, as much as she loves the infants and toddlers for which she cared.  "They always have snotty faces. It's just one cold after another," she says. "It feels just like an epicenter for spreading disease. And it feels really scary to go back to that."  
                Lainy Morse shows students Wesley Schmidt and Celeste Abraldes a bearded dragon in a photo taken when school was open. Morse says that with unemployment benefits, she and her fellow teachers are making more now than they did on the job.

             Lainy Morse shows students Wesley Schmidt and Celeste Abraldes a bearded dragon in a photo taken when school was open. Morse says that with unemployment benefits, she and her fellow teachers are making more now than they did on the job. In addition to risking infection with COVID-19, going back to work would also mean a cut in pay for Morse. Thanks to the extra $600 a week in unemployment benefits the federal government has been offering during the pandemic, Morse and her fellow teachers are making more now than they did on the job. "It's terrible to say, but we're all doing better now," she says. "It's hard to think about going back to work in this pandemic and getting paid less than we are right now when we're safe and at home in quarantine."  It's a dilemma that millions of unemployed Americans may face as businesses around the country start to reopen. And it's a question lawmakers will be wrestling with as they debate whether to extend the supplemental unemployment benefits past July. The Cracker Barrel restaurant where Avery Adams worked has just resumed limited indoor dining again after weeks of takeout-only service. But the Gravel Switch, Ky., resident is in no hurry to go back.   "I don't feel like it's over yet," Adams says, pointing to a jump in coronavirus deaths in Kentucky at the beginning of last week. "I would wait to see, as things reopen, if the caseload increases again."  The restaurant has been patient about recalling workers, and Adams has decided to stay home for now. Mostly he's concerned for the safety of the four older relatives with whom he lives. But the extra $600 he's receiving in unemployment benefits does factor into his decision. "I would say it has to, to some extent," Adams says. "It still really needs to be more about my family members, but it's been very generous having the CARES Act."  Some business owners complain that generous unemployment benefits are making it harder for them to find workers.  Rachel Davis runs a consignment shop in Warrensburg, Mo. Since reopening this month, she's been buying hand sanitizer by the gallon.  "Disinfectant is my new fragrance," she jokes. She's limiting traffic in the store to three customers at a time. And everyone who comes in must wear a mask.  "Customers have thanked us for that," Davis says. "And my sales are actually up since we reopened." Davis also gave her part-time employees a modest pay raise. But the $10 to $11 an hour they make is significantly less than they were collecting on unemployment. One of Davis' four workers has not come back.   "I know I shouldn't take it personally," Davis says. "She's doing what she feels [is] in her best interest. But as an employer, it actually kind of hurts."  Economists at the University of Chicago estimate that more than two-thirds of the workers on unemployment insurance are making more in jobless benefits than they did at work — in some cases two to three times as much. It's a stark reminder of just how low the pay is in many hard-hit industries such as restaurants and retail.  When millions of low-wage workers are suddenly forced to stop working to protect public health, there are good reasons for the federal government to step in with some relief.  "Getting people money today so that you can buy groceries and not go hungry, getting people money so they can pay their rent, the basic necessities of life, kind of makes sense," economist Joseph Vavra says. He notes that some workers lost health benefits as well as income. And the government's goal at first was to keep people at home.    Still, Vavra and his University of Chicago colleagues say the flat, $600-a-week benefit does create questions of fairness, especially when other low-income workers are still on the job doing essential work. "If you're a janitor and you work at a hospital, you're facing increased risk at your job and likely have not received a pay raise," economist Peter Ganong says. "But if you're a janitor and you work at a school that's shut down, then you actually get a 50% pay raise from claiming unemployment benefits." Likewise, retail workers on furlough are collecting 42% more on average from unemployment than the grocery workers who are busy stocking shelves.  Arguments about fairness and whether the extra unemployment benefits discourage a return to work are likely to grow louder in Congress. House Democrats passed a bill that would extend the additional benefits through January. Senate Republicans are resistant. Ganong and Vavra stress that with double-digit unemployment, maintaining some form of enhanced benefits will be vital. But they suggest an alternative formula so that benefits more closely match — but don't exceed — workers' old paychecks.  The flat, $600-a-week figure was adopted in March as an expedient way to get money out the door quickly. By July, Ganong and Vavra argue, there should be time to craft a more nuanced approach. In many cases, workers who turn down a job offer from their old employer may lose their eligibility to collect unemployment insurance.   That's a chance Sonya Chartier and her husband are willing to take. They both opted not to return to work at a Wisconsin furniture store where customers are not required to wear masks. Chartier says she worries about infecting her mother-in-law, who lives with the couple. "We're lucky and we can decide to stay home," she says. "I know so many people can't make that decision, and it's really hard. But we don't feel like it's safe to go out yet."  Chartier has started to look for new jobs — maybe one she can do from home or while otherwise avoiding risk. Her No. 1 question for would-be employers: What are you doing to protect your workers?Scientists have learned a great deal about how the novel coronavirus spreads. But one of the mysteries they're still trying to untangle is where the virus, known as SARS-CoV-2, came from in the first place. Scientific evidence points overwhelmingly to wildlife — and to bats as the most likely origin point. Bats are critically important for pollinating flowers and dispersing seeds. They catch bugs, the same ones that bite us and eat some of our crops. But bats also harbor some of the toughest known zoonotic diseases — those caused by germs that spread between animals and people. The rabies virus, the Marburg virus, the Hendra and Nipah viruses all find a natural reservoir in bats, meaning those viruses can live in bats without harming them. The Ebola outbreak in West Africa was traced to a bat colony. The SARS virus originates in bats, along with other coronaviruses. And now, SARS-CoV-2 is linked to bats too. The virus has a 96% genetic similarity to coronavirus samples previously found in bats.   Globally, zoonotic diseases have been on the rise for decades. The CDC estimates that six out of ten infectious diseases in people come from animals. Increased human interactions with animals through land development that destroys habitat, agricultural practices and livestock and wildlife trade have created a perfect storm for emerging diseases to appear throughout the world, pathogens both previously known and completely novel. There is not enough genetic evidence to know how precisely this particular coronavirus transmitted from animals (likely bats) to humans, and whether an intermediate animal was involved in the chain of transmission. Further genetic testing and evidence is needed to fully know where this coronavirus came from. The work of virus hunting — of tracking an outbreak to its origin point — can take years. The 2003 outbreak of SARS, for instance, took a decade of detective work, sampling the feces, urine, or blood of thousands of horseshoe bats across China until a match was found.

             On Tuesday, April 28 demonstrators outside Westville Correctional Facility protested conditions in the facility. Scottie Edwards died of COVID-19 just weeks before he would have gotten out of the Westville Correctional Facility in Indiana. Edwards, 73, began showing symptoms of the disease in early April, according to the accounts of three inmates who lived with him in a dormitory. He was short of breath, had chest pain, and could barely talk. He was also dizzy, sweaty and throwing up. Edwards was serving a 40-year sentence for attempting to kill someone in 2001. He would have been released to home detention on May 1, but died on April 13. The next day the Indiana Department of Correction sent out a statement that indicated Edwards' symptoms came on suddenly: "The offender, a male over the age of 70, who did not have indications of illness, reported experiencing chest pains and trouble breathing on Monday."  Edwards' fellow inmates dispute the statement and say he had been seeking medical attention at the prison for days before he died.  Since the start of the pandemic, prisoners and their families have contradicted state officials about the conditions inside Indiana prisons. Many inmates report they've had no way to protect themselves from close contact with other inmates and staff members. They believe contracting the disease is inevitable. Indeed, 85% percent of the prisoners tested at Westville have been positive for the virus. Many of them were housed in the same dorm as Edwards.  As of May 22, at least 18 Indiana prisoners have died from confirmed or presumed coronavirus infections, and 650 inmates have tested positive for the virus. And while the state has maintained that it isolates men and women with symptoms, inmates say even severely ill prisoners have been left in their dorms until it is too late. Their accounts call into question efforts to contain the virus, along with the care inmates receive once they have it.  "[Edwards] had been sick for approximately about a week and a half," says one inmate named Josh. Josh allowed a family member to record a call about Edwards, and he asked to be identified by his first name only, because he fears retaliation from prison staff.  His fellow prisoners say Edwards couldn't even make it to see medical staff on his own — they pushed him in a wheelchair. Each time, he was sent back to his quarters.  "Those bastards said I'm fine, I just need to drink water and rest," Josh recounted Edwards saying. "I'm clearly not fine — I can't breathe." Another prisoner wrote in an electronic message to a reporter that Edwards' room "smelled like sickness and death." On the day he died, Josh says Edwards looked pale before he stumbled on his way  to the bathroom. A pair of fellow inmates caught him and helped him sit down. "He sounded like he was winded, like he had just ran a marathon," Josh wrote via the prison system's electronic communications software. "He was just saying 'I can't breathe, I can't breathe.'" He says an officer called the prison medical staff, who tended to Edwards in the bathroom for about 45 minutes.  "They finally took him out on oxygen," Josh says. "Next thing we know, five hours later, he died."  The Westville inmates emphasize that Edwards didn't wait until that Monday to report his symptoms — he had complained to staff for days. "There is a major problem here with this place and it's outta control," wrote Josh.  Dr. Kristen Dauss, chief medical officer for the Indiana Department of Correction, declined to explain the different accounts of his death. "We do not talk about specific cases and patient clinical status," she says.  Across the nation, at least 415 prisoners had died of the infection as of the week of May 20, and more than 29,000 had tested positive, according to the Marshall Project.  The American Civil Liberties Union and other advocacy groups have called for the early release of some prisoners, especially the old and sick. Protesters have demonstrated outside Westville and other Indiana prisons to call attention to the conditions inside. Governors in the nearby states of Ohio and Kentucky have ordered some prisoners released, but Indiana Gov. Eric Holcomb has refused. He says it's up to local judges to decide, on a case-by-case basis.  In the meantime, Dauss says Indiana prisons are taking steps to control the spread of the coronavirus. "We move quickly and, in fact, immediately to separate those who are sick from those who are not sick," says Dauss.  But according to accounts from numerous inmates, that kind of quick isolation of sick prisoners hasn't always happened, at least through much of April.  Three different prisoners described another COVID-19 death in a different Indiana prison, the Plainfield Correctional Facility, on April 19. Lonnell Chaney, they said, had been asking for medical help for days.  "He didn't even know where he was," one inmate wrote to a reporter. Medical staff had checked on Chaney, who mumbled in response, but left him in the quarters. A prisoner tried to convince officers that the man's condition was serious — Chaney couldn't catch his breath — but the officers brushed it off.  The prisoners say Chaney, who was 61, died in his bed in the crowded dorm. "You must be almost dead to get outside help," wrote the Plainfield inmate.  Six Plainfield prisoners have died during the coronavirus pandemic. The Department of Correction has not released a statement about any of those men. Of 145 Plainfield prisoners tested for the virus, 119 were positive. Forty five staffers tested positive, as well. Indiana reports two deaths of prison staffers, as of May 22.  At the Westville prison, Josh says another man in his dorm complained about similar symptoms, and correctional officers wrote the man up for being disruptive.  "Everybody here is terrified," Josh says.  As the virus spreads, prisoners' families are told very little. They say prisons refuse to disclose basic information that would put them at ease, including whether an inmate is alive. In Scottie Edwards' case and others, families didn't know their loved ones were sick until after they had died—even though a department policy calls for notification when "death may be imminent."  Crystal Gillispie talked to her father, Lonnell Chaney, for the last time on April 13. Their call lasted five minutes, but felt shorter. He told her to send pictures of his grandkids. And even though the coronavirus had started to spread in his dorm at the Plainfield Correctional Facility, he was more concerned about his family.  "He was like, 'Just make sure you're wearing your gloves and masks,'" Gillispie remembers. "I was like, 'Okay, Daddy. You do the same.' He was so worried about us, and he ended up catching it." 
                Lonnell Chaney, an inmate at the Plainfield Correctional Facility made pleas with correctional officers to be taken to the medical unit when he contracted COVID-19. He later passed in his dorm from the disease, only having received a check up from medical personnel.

             The next time she heard news of her father, it was from her aunt, his sister: the prison had called her to say Chaney was dead.  Edwards' sister, Gloria Sam, says her brother was new to Westville prison, because he'd recently requested transfer to a facility with a law library. He ended up at Westville just before the pandemic started.  "He said 'I am afraid of this virus because we're here close together and if it comes out it'll spread like wildfire,'" she says. Sam hadn't heard from Edwards in more than a week when her phone rang on April 14. She remembers that even though her caller ID said it was from the State of Indiana, it didn't occur to her that it was about her brother.  "They said, 'Well, we have some bad news.' I thought they were gonna say he was sick," she says. They told her he had died.  If possible, Sam says, she would have wanted to say goodbye.  "It's one of the most hurtful things I've experienced in my life," she says.  This story comes from NPR's partnership with Side Effects Public Media, WFYI, and Kaiser Health News. Austin Beutner looked haggard, his face a curtain of worry lines. The superintendent of the second-largest school district in the nation sat at a desk last week delivering a video address to Los Angeles families. But he began with a stark message clearly meant for another audience: Lawmakers in Sacramento and Washington, D.C. "Cuts to funding at schools will forever impact the lives of children," Beutner said less than a week after California's governor called for emergency cuts in education spending. The harm children face from these cuts, Beutner warned, "is just as real a threat to them as is the coronavirus." Similar alarms are sounding in districts across the country. With the nation's attention still fixed on the COVID-19 health crisis, school leaders are warning of a financial meltdown that could devastate many districts and set back an entire generation of students. "I think we're about to see a school funding crisis unlike anything we have ever seen in modern history," warns Rebecca Sibilia, the CEO of EdBuild, a school finance advocacy organization. "We are looking at devastation that we could not have imagined ... a year ago." "Really shocking declines" Schools receive nearly half of their funding from state coffers. But with businesses shuttered in response to the pandemic and the unemployment rate already nearing 15% — well above its 10% peak during the Great Recession — state income and sales tax revenues are crashing. For April, the first full month of the coronavirus lockdowns, states are now reporting "really shocking declines" in tax revenues, says Michael Leachman at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Some states have lost "as much as 25% or a third of their revenues compared to the previous year in the same month," Leachman says. And unlike the federal government, most state governments are required to balance their budgets. The result: Many governors and state lawmakers are now racing to implement deep cuts, including to school funding. In early May, for example, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine unveiled $300 million in K-12 budget cuts — and that's just through June 30, when the current fiscal year ends. In Cleveland schools, according to Cleveland.com, that amounts to about $100 less per student with the possibility of more cuts in the new fiscal year. A few days earlier, Georgia's governor asked state education leaders to prepare for a 14% cut in funding starting in July. And in Michigan, a top Republican in the state Senate warned superintendents they could see their school funding slashed by as much as 25%. In many states, these cuts will hit vulnerable, low-income communities the hardest. That's because of how America funds education. On average, the bulk of a school's resources comes from a roughly even split between state and local funding, the latter largely from local property taxes. But differences in property wealth between districts have created decades-old disparities that many states have tried to alleviate with additional state money. As a result, "when state funding starts to drop," says Michael Griffith at the Learning Policy Institute, "what we see is a separation between the haves and have-nots." Worse than the Great Recession At first, experts say, school cuts will mirror the losses of the Great Recession. Districts will trim spending on buildings and transportation, supplies and equipment. Then will come staff cuts, beginning with librarians, nurses and counselors. The U.S. lost roughly 120,000 teachers between 2008 and 2010, Griffith says. More than a decade later, "we still don't have the number of public school teachers today that we had in 2008." The current pandemic-driven downturn promises to be even harder on schools. "From the numbers we're looking at right now, this coming year could be maybe twice as bad, or more, than the worst year we had during the Great Recession," Griffith says. Staff cuts, for example, have already skyrocketed. "We know that in April, school districts nationally furloughed or laid off nearly half a million workers," says Leachman at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. "That is an astonishing number. It's many more than lost their jobs through the entirety of the Great Recession. It's all happened in one month." Leachman says many of those affected have been bus drivers and school staff who were laid off as schools closed their doors for the remainder of the academic year. A lot of them obviously hope to return. "But, given the collapse in state revenues, it's likely that unless the federal government steps in ... many of these workers will never get their jobs back." Griffith estimates that if states slash education spending by 15%, schools could be forced to shed more than 300,000 teaching positions — almost 10% of the national K-12 teacher force. Other school budget experts are singing a similar refrain, as are district leaders such as Austin Beutner, who warned in his video address that schools would need the same emergency infusion of resources that hospitals and many businesses have already gotten. "We're looking at the same challenge in public education, and we need the same full-throated response," Beutner said. Thus far, Congress has offered just a whisper. Little bipartisan appetite for more spending The $2 trillion coronavirus relief bill, known as the CARES Act, provided K-12 schools with more than $13 billion in emergency funding, an average boost of about $270 per student. But spending the money has been complicated by controversial guidance from the U.S. Department of Education. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos is advising public schools to spend far more relief money than they'd planned to on services for students at private schools. Louisiana, for example, reports that under a traditional reading of the CARES Act, its private school students would receive services worth $8.6 million. Under the department's broader interpretation, though, that share would jump to $31.5 million — a 267% increase. The department's guidance, issued on April 30, confused many school leaders, prompting a letter from the Council of Chief State School Officers telling DeVos that if the guidance is not revised it "could significantly harm the vulnerable students who were intended to benefit the most" from the CARES Act. In a response signed by DeVos herself, the education secretary writes, "the Department disagrees with your interpretation of the law." DeVos goes on to say: "All students and teachers have had their learning disrupted. A growing list of non-public schools have announced they will not be able to re-open, and these school closures are concentrated in low-income and middle-class communities. I would encourage educators everywhere to be as concerned about those students and teachers as they are with those in public schools." Even without that guidance and the confusion it has caused, advocates say, the relief funds in the CARES Act won't be nearly enough. In a letter to congressional leaders earlier this month, dozens of organizations representing teachers, principals and parents requested at least $175 billion more for K-12 schools. "While we don't yet know what the full impact of the novel coronavirus that has spread across the nation will be," the letter says, "we do know that both the economic hardship and the grief and trauma that ensue from COVID-19 will be unprecedented for today's school-age children." In other words, schools won't just need help making up for dramatic gaps in state spending. They'll need extra money to pay for the extra things they're being asked to do: feed children and families in hard-hit communities, help millions of students make up for learning time they've lost while home, and make sure schools are safe when children do finally return to class. So far, though, Congress has shown little bipartisan appetite for more school spending. In mid-May, House Democrats passed the HEROES Act, which would provide K-12 schools with an additional $60 billion, but House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., dismissed the move, saying, "this is a political messaging bill that has no chance of becoming law."May 1st is historically the deadline for college-bound students to decide which college they'll be attending. This year, with so much uncertainty about what college will actually look like in the fall, about 400 institutions have pushed back this deadline to June. Andrew Limbong of NPR's Arts desk interviews Elissa Nadworny, an NPR Education reporter, about some of the hefty decisions college-bound students are weighing this spring. This conversation has been edited for length and clarity. What resources are available for students who need more financial assistance than they were offered? It's possible that the financial aid  you were offered by your college of choice isn't enough. Perhaps your or your family's financial situation has changed in the last few months. Good news: You are able to appeal you financial aid. The appeals process happens with each individual institution (as opposed to when you originally filled out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid or FAFSA). There's a really helpful free tool to do this called SwiftStudent. It'll help you navigate that process with sample letters and make sure you're collecting the right documents so that you're not wasting your time going back and forth with the financial aid office. You're not alone — financial aid officers are already seeing lots of appeals. They're ready! What sort of questions should students be asking as they consider their options? The hardest question but the most important question is the financial one.  You have to sit down with the people who are important in your life and who are part of that financial decision and ask, is this affordable? If it's not affordable, what are my other options? Are there cheaper options closer to home like community college? Is there a way that I can go to the university and request more money? Tara Miller is a college and career counselor at Austin High School in Texas and she's been advising her students and families to focus on what they can control right now, not what they can't. When it comes to deciding where to go, she says, "the best thing to do is listen to how the colleges are communicating." Are they open to conversations? Are they being flexible and honest? "The way they are reaching out to you now is really going to be telling how they will treat students when campuses or even their online learning spaces open up."  Are students reconsidering attending colleges that are far from their hometowns?  Lots of students are rethinking their colleges plans. Many are considering staying closer to home at least for the immediate future. If there's an emergency or another outbreak in the coming year, many students would prefer to be closer to home. Also, if school is going to be online anyway, why not take general education requirements at a local community college? Tuition is cheaper and the experience will look similar. Community colleges are definitely bracing for more enrollment. What might campus life look like in the fall? Nobody really knows yet! A lot of different ideas are being floated. The California State University system announced they are planning to be virtual in the fall. Others have said they'll be in-person, but with shorter three-week block schedules, freshman-only campuses or with dorm rooms converted to be single occupancy. Stanford even floated the idea of hosting lectures outside in big tents. No idea is off the table.  Are more students considering taking a gap year? Yes. But let's clarify the term "gap year." Often folks refer to a gap year as a time when a student officially defers acceptance to an institution and then takes a year to do a very specific thing — a job, an internship or travel. They have a clear start date for when they'll return to school. That often gets conflated with just delaying enrollment.  We know that it gets a lot harder to enroll in college the longer you wait. Students who delay and don't enroll in college after high school are less likely to graduate and less likely to get a Bachelor's degree.  That's because life happens and and it can be really hard to tear yourself away from that in a year and go back to college. Are students thinking differently about what they plan to study once they get to college? Yes. But that might be a good thing. Kamla Charles, a career counselor at Valencia College in Orlando, told me that college majors, don't matter as much as students think they do, especially when it comes to getting a job after graduation. "When you major in something, you feel like this major specifically fits just this area," she says." The major that you're in is providing you with a foundation. But really, your experiences and the opportunities that you take advantage of shape your career pathway." Colleges are also re-thinking the programs they offer — especially community colleges. Many higher ed leaders are thinking deeply about what majors and courses they can offer that are very specific to this moment. We often see the most adaptability and flexibility at our nation's community colleges. Those are the folks that are seeing the economy. They're seeing the jobs that folks need to go into and they're trying to meet those needs.  Anything you'd recommend for college-bound students to do?  For folks not coming from high school, lean on the admissions staff or financial aid staff at the college you are interested in. For high school seniors: Don't forget to take advantage of your school's counselors. Your high school building may very well be closed, but your counselors and school mentors are all still working. It's hard to make these decisions in a vacuum. Reach out to the people who have been guiding you through this process from day one.  Have a random life tip you want to share?

             People enjoy the spring weather in mid-April at a restaurant in Stockholm during the coronavirus pandemic. Sweden's controversial approach to fighting the coronavirus pandemic has so far failed to produce the expected results, and there are calls within the country for the government to change its strategy. "We have a very vivid political debate," Karin Olofsdotter, Sweden's ambassador to the United States, told NPR. "I don't think people are protesting on the streets but ... there's a very big debate, if this [strategy] is the right thing to do or not, on Facebook and everywhere." Unlike its Nordic neighbors, Sweden decided against instituting a strict lockdown. The government has enforced social distancing rules but decided to keep most bars, restaurants, schools and retail shops open. The country's approach relies on public cooperation to slow the spread and not overwhelm the hospital system. Health officials also hoped that keeping the country open would mean its younger, not-at-risk population would develop immunity against the virus, potentially leading to herd immunity. Anders Tegnell, chief epidemiologist at Sweden's Public Health Agency, said in an interview with CNBC in late April that sampling and modeling data indicated that about 20% of Stockholm's population is already immune to the virus. Olofsdotter told NPR last month that the country's capital could reach herd immunity by the end of this month. Herd immunity occurs when enough people of a population are immune to an infectious disease, either because they've been infected and recovered or they've been vaccinated against it. Some researchers have put the threshold for coronavirus herd immunity at 60%. Unfortunately, Stockholm will not reach this milestone in May. "No that will not happen," Tegnell said Monday in an email to NPR. "Current investigations show different numbers, but [Stockholm's immunity rate] is likely lower [than 30%]. As you might be aware, there is a problem with measuring immunity for this virus." Sweden's Public Health Agency last week released the initial findings of an ongoing antibodies study that showed that 7.3% of people in Stockholm had developed antibodies against COVID-19 by late April. Tegnell later described the study's figure as a "bit lower than we'd thought," adding that the findings represented a snapshot of the situation some weeks ago and he believed that by now "a little more than 20%" of Stockholm's population should have contracted the virus. It's the same figure he mentioned in the CNBC interview more than a month ago. The study's results have provided further fuel for the critics of the Swedish approach. With 39.57 deaths per 100,000, Sweden's mortality rate is not only higher than that of the U.S. (30.02 deaths per 100,000) but also exponentially higher than those of its neighbors Norway (4.42 per 100,000) and Finland (5.58 per 100,000), which both enacted strict lockdown measures, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. A protest Sunday against the government's anti-lockdown strategy at Stockholm's Sergels Torg attracted a few dozen people. One of the protest signs read, "In memory of everyone who Sweden couldn't save with its strategy." The Swedish Embassy in Washington, D.C., said in a statement to NPR that the country's government as well as its public health agency believe it's still "far too early to draw any clear conclusions or comparisons connected to the coronavirus pandemic," but "we are open with that the strategy has failed to protect the elderly living in care homes." Nearly half of the country's more than 4,000 COVID-19 deaths have occurred in such care facilities. A majority of Swedes, 63%, according to one recent poll, support the measures Tegnell's agency has recommended. For some anti-lockdown protesters in the U.S., "Be like Sweden" has become a rallying cry at protests. But given the political, social and cultural differences between the two countries, simply adopting the Swedish model might not work. "Every country and region is different, and every country and region needs do what they think is best for their place," said Olofsdotter, the Swedish ambassador. "In Sweden, there's a fairly big trust between the population and the government and its agencies and vice versa. Of course, if we can be an inspiration to others, and they find measures that we have used useful in either a state or region, that's good, because we are all in this together." Even without a nationwide lockdown, Sweden's economy has taken a hit as people continue to follow the government's guidelines and stay at home. Google records indicated that trips to retail and recreational destinations in Stockholm are down 23%, while passenger numbers on public transit declined 29% between March 28 and May 9. Sweden's central bank, the Riksbank, provided two potential scenarios for the country's economic outlook in 2020. "Despite the comprehensive measures both in Sweden and abroad, the economic consequences of the pandemic will be considerable," the Riksbank said in a statement in April. "The consequences for the economy will vary depending on how long the spread of infection continues and on how long the restrictions implemented to slow it down are in place."  Both scenarios predict a rise in the unemployment rate and a contraction of the country's gross domestic product. The central bank expects unemployment to rise from 6.8% to 10.1% and GDP to shrink by up to 9.7% this year as result of the pandemic. Earlier this month, Tegnell admitted he is not sure Sweden's strategy was the right call. "I'm not convinced at all — we are constantly thinking about this," he told Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet.
                A recent study found that black doctors were more effective than non-black doctors at convincing black men to use preventative health services.

             A recent study found that black doctors were more effective than non-black doctors at convincing black men to use preventative health services. A visit to a new doctor can be a stressful experience. You know the feeling. Sitting in a cold exam room, naked save for a flimsy gown, waiting for a stranger to poke and prod you. When the doctor finally enters, most of us are looking for signs that we can trust this person, that they are going to help rather than harm us.   So what is it that makes us trust doctors enough to allow them to stick needles in our skin or put us on a diet?  That's what Owen Garrick wanted to know. He's a doctor and researcher in Oakland, California, and has been trying to improve health outcomes for black men.  Black men have the lowest life expectancy of any major demographic group.   Owen says they are dying of preventable or chronic diseases like prostate cancer.  "It's not just prostate cancer; it is cardiovascular disease, it is stroke, it is diabetes."  Owen and his colleagues wondered what it would take to get black men to go to the doctor for preventative care. They had a hunch that race might be a factor. So they ran a field study to try to answer one simple question: Will black men take more preventative care services if they are randomly assigned to a black doctor? They recruited men from barbershops and flea markets around Oakland. About 600 agreed to go to a clinic for a checkup.   The study found that black men assigned to a black doctor did accept more preventative services. And not by a little — by a lot.  The black doctors were about 50 percent more successful than non-black doctors at getting their patients to agree to invasive tests for diabetes and the flu shot. When it came to cholesterol screening, they were 72 percent more effective.   The real-life implications could be huge. If people in the real world responded as they did in Owen's study, the gap between blacks and whites in cardiovascular disease outcomes might shrink by nearly 20 percent. "That could be 20 percent of people living to see their grandkids graduate from college and high school," Owen says. "That's how I think about it." This week on Hidden Brain, we travel from medical clinics to school classrooms for a look at how shared identity creates understanding and trust.

             Boris Deutch painted this 1941 Works Progress Administration mural in the Terminal Annex building in Los Angeles, Calif. The Great Depression challenged Americans not just with horrifically high unemployment, but ideological divides not utterly unlike the ones we face today. Today, poll after poll show the country deeply split on major issues. Racism, Islamophobia and anti-Semitism are on the rise. Back then, the labor movement was burgeoning; so was membership in the Ku Klux Klan. Rampant anti-Semitism informed powerful public figures such as Henry Ford and Charles Lindbergh, and millions of people listened as Father Charles Coughlin railed against immigrants and in favor of fascism in his weekly radio broadcasts. Meanwhile, black people were excluded from segregated soup kitchens as African American unemployment hovered around 50 percent.  When the Roosevelt administration rolled out tens of millions of dollars during the New Deal to fund artists, musicians, writers and actors, its mission was more than just job creation. It wanted to create a version of American culture that everyone could rally behind. Music, art classes, posters, plays and photography funded by the federal government were supposed to unite a nation in turmoil.  Working for the Farm Security Administration, photographers Dorothea Lange and Walker Evans took empathetic photos of rural white sharecroppers. Gordon Parks documented the resilient faces of Washington, D.C.'s black working class.  Composer Aaron Copland was commissioned by the Works Progress Administration to write Quiet City for the Group Theatre in 1939. Painter Jackson Pollock was stealing food from pushcarts before he was hired by the WPA's famed murals division. And writer Ralph Ellison used language from the oral histories he recorded for the WPA in Harlem in his later groundbreaking novel The Invisible Man.

Only seven percent of its budget went to federal arts and history projects, but the WPA paid artists a living wage, says Ann Prentice Wagner, who co-curated the 2009 Smithsonian exhibition 1934: A New Deal For Artists. Musicians, writers and other artists were hired at various wage levels, according to their abilities. "People who were master artists might make as much as forty-five dollars a week," Wagner says. Adjusting for inflation, that's equivalent to $855 in 2020. "This was at a time when laborers like longshoreman might be making 10 cents an hour or maybe even a dollar or two a day."

             At a time when many Americans felt they had little in common, the WPA assured them of a vital, shared cultural identity through theater, art and music, says Lauren Sklaroff, a history professor at the University of South Carolina. "Many Americans had not ever seen a live play, listened to a symphony that was live, had never visited an art museum," she says. "So the idea behind the federal arts project was to bring art to the masses so that America would have a common lexicon to draw from, in terms what culture meant." That culture might mean broadcasting African American gospel choirs  nationally on the radio through WPA auspices, or hiring a young Mark Rothko to paint. Richard Wright contributed to the WPA's guide to New York City. John Cheever hated working as an editor for the Federal Writers' Project, but the job helped establish his writing career. Director Orson Welles staged a celebrated version of Macbeth for the Federal Theatre Project with an all-black cast that ended up touring the country. (You can see parts of it here.) "The Roosevelt administration had a cabinet of African Americans advising them on racial issues, and so the same was mirrored in these arts projects," Sklaroff says. While often problematic, she stresses, these programs were also progressive for their era. Teams of documentarians, black and white, recorded oral histories from formerly enslaved Americans. While the results are uneven at best, the records are now an important collection in the Library of Congress and form the basis of much contemporary study on slavery. Among the out-of-work teachers, ministers and secretaries hired by the Federal Writers' Project to record songs and stories in various communities was a young anthropologist. Zora Neale Hurston had recently written a novel — Their Eyes Were Watching God — and recorded the songs of workers in Florida turpentine camps. Her boss, Stetson Kennedy, would later achieve national fame for infiltrating the Ku Klux Klan and exposing their secrets. "The generation that was saved by that funding turned out to be the greatest and most acclaimed in the history of American art," asserts Ann Prentice Wagner. Indeed, it's difficult to quantify the ongoing benefits of the WPA's arts programs. Its murals still decorate city halls, post offices and public schools (not without controversy) and hundreds of the community arts centers it established are still in existence across the country. Critics denounced these projects as propaganda, and according to arts leaders interviewed for this story, it's wishful thinking to imagine the WPA arts programs could be revived anytime soon. To Wagner, though , their relevance has never been clearer. "How do we know what we've got this time around?" she wonders.  "How do we know what creative minds could be working on right now unless we give them a chance?" It's highly unlikely that the current government would fund murals of front-line workers, grocery store clerks, meat packers or Amazon warehouse laborers on the walls of civic institutions. Nor is public art needed as badly as PPEs, or a vaccine for COVID-19. Still, Wagner points out that paying people to find and tell stories promoting shared American values might help with another sickness the country suffers from right now.

             Two astronauts will launch to the International Space Station aboard a new capsule built by the company SpaceX. This week, NASA and the commercial company SpaceX are set to launch two astronauts to the International Space Station (ISS) in a new capsule. This is the first launch by NASA of astronauts from U.S. soil in nearly a decade, but it's happening in the middle of a pandemic.  Here are some of the ways that the coronavirus will, and won't, change the plans for the space agency's latest launch. Astronauts have been quarantining since before it was cool. 
                Astronaut Chris Cassidy of NASA, left, and cosmonauts Anatoly Ivanishin and Ivan Vagner, lived under strict quarantine ahead of an April flight to the space station.

             For decades, astronauts have avoided illness before flying by entering into quarantine ahead of their missions. Even a minor illness on Earth has the potential to cause big problems in space, says Serena Auñón-Chancellor, a NASA astronaut and associate professor of internal medicine at Louisiana State University Health in Baton Rouge. "Those common cold symptoms, you don't want to bring to the space station, they're not fun to deal with up there." Auñón-Chancellor herself was quarantined for 18 days in Kazakhstan before her 2018 mission to the station. "Some people we would see from behind glass," she recalls. The quarantine procedures are actually a little easier to implement in the middle of the pandemic. Astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley have spent two weeks in quarantine ahead of their launch, according to Rob Mulcahy, a NASA flight surgeon in charge of the pre-launch quarantine program. But this time around, stay-at-home rules have actually allowed the astronauts to spend their first week in their own houses. "Because the families are able to quarantine with them, they're able to stay at home," Mulcahy says.But bigger changes are being required of those working on the launch from Earth.There have been two reported cases of coronavirus infection in employees at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC), where the launch will take place. Neither is believed to be linked to work at the center.Nevertheless, officials at KSC say that they are taking appropriate steps and providing masks and hand sanitizer to workers as needed. SpaceX too is taking steps to keep its workforce safe — including using masks and social distancing in certain areas. And at mission control in Houston, Texas, Mulcahy says they've activated a back-up control room, so that different shifts don't have to operate the same equipment in case of contamination.Once they're up, the astronauts will be winning social distancing. At 250 miles above the surface of the planet, the space station is the ultimate stay-at-home locale. "Once you get to ISS and you don't bring any viruses with you, you're pretty darn safe from that time point," Auñón-Chancellor says.  Hurley and Behnken will join Chris Cassidy, and cosmonauts Anatoly Ivanishin and Ivan Vagner, who traveled to the station in early April.But the space station is not as sterile as one might think. After years of astronauts travelling aloft, and carrying microbes with them, the station is now home to numerous different kinds of (mostly) benign bacteria and fungi. Space fans will have to watch from home.

             Crowds watch as the Space Shuttle Discovery lifts off from Kennedy Space Center in 2005. NASA is asking people to stay away from this week's launch due to the pandemic. Normally, rocket nuts and well-wishers would crowd Florida's Space Coast to see the return of astronaut launches from the Kennedy Space Center. But NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine is discouraging crowds from attending this launch.  "We're asking people not to travel to Kennedy, but to watch online," Bridenstine said in a news conference earlier this month.Fortunately, the entire event will be streamed live on NASA TV.

             Left: Jana De Brauwere, a contact tracer in California. Right: Rachel Saykpah, a nurse in Liberia who has overseen contact tracers in Africa since 2014. What advice is there for the army of new contact tracers out to find anyone who has been near a newly diagnosed coronavirus patient? We asked two contact tracers for their best insights. One is a veteran: registered nurse Rachel Saykpah of Liberia, who after two exposures to patients during the Ebola outbreak was inspired to begin working with the Liberia National Red Cross Society in 2014. She oversaw around 70 tracers and eventually became a quality assurance officer with Last Mile Health, a Liberian nonprofit that deploys health workers in remote areas. The other contact tracer we spoke to is Jana De Brauwere, who manages the business, science and technology department at the San Francisco Public Library. She's one of thousands of city workers and volunteers activated in a partnership between the California Department of Public Health and the University of California, San Francisco to stop the virus's spread through contact tracing and case investigation. Based on their respective experiences tracing Ebola in Liberia and COVID-19 in California, here are six key takeaways Saykpah and De Brauwere have on contact tracing during a disease outbreak. 1. Be prepared to be judged by the neighbors.  Saykpah can speak not just as a contact tracer but as someone who was "traced" after her contact with patients. In 2013, workers from Liberia's Ministry of Health would come to her door to take her temperature and monitor her for any signs or symptoms she might develop. "Everyone in your community, when they see someone coming to your door, they want to know what they are coming for," she says. "And when you are a health worker and they see people coming to your door and testing you, it can be traumatizing." Being outed as someone who potentially contracted the virus or has been in contact with a sick person can contribute to the stigma that arises during an outbreak, says Saykpah. In her case, the workers coming to her door did not wear personal protective equipment, which she presumes could've been because of a lack of enough protective gear but also might have been intentional — to de-escalate any stigma since the interview was conducted outside her house in plain sight of neighbors. 2. People may be scared to disclose personal information. Any time a potential contact is traced, they're asked to provide demographic information about themselves, including name, address and date of birth. De Brauwere says some people she has spoken with in California express fear that their immigration status may be used against them if they comply with the interview — some even hang up once they're asked such basic identity questions. "This just happened to me actually, during my last shift," she says. A patient who'd received a message from a contact tracer called back and confessed, "I didn't want to pick up because I thought [U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement] was calling me." 3. Get to know community leaders.  The most efficient way to earn people's trust? Go straight to the leaders they already believe in. Saykpah says when she started training contact tracers in Liberia in 2014, they made sure to meet with community representatives who encouraged others to have faith in the contact tracers. "So then these people go out and talk to [their community members] and say, 'These are our health workers. They have come to save our lives. If you think you came in contact with this [patient], give your information so they can be able to save you,' " she says. "With that process, everyone who was in contact with an identified case was willing to provide all of this information." 4. Getting feedback from mentors — and experienced health workers — is key. Although Saykpah is a registered nurse, she says there were no specific requirements or qualifications that volunteers needed to meet to become contact tracers in Liberia. "We got community volunteers who are government trained doing health education in the community to come on board and do the contact tracing," she explains. "They began tracing at the county level with health practitioners to guide them." Similarly, De Brauwere has no medical background — but she says she received about 20 hours of training from the California Department of Public Health. "There's a lot of support for the tracers — a lot of quality control making sure we are sticking to the script, asking the questions correctly and providing the current resources the best we can," she says. 5. Speak their language — literally. Not everyone who receives a call from the California tracers speaks English, which means there's a need for tracers who can conduct interviews in different languages — especially in immigrant communities where many essential workers face higher risks of contracting the virus. "What I'm finding out on my shifts is that most of the contacts are actually Spanish speakers, so the English speakers would use interpreters for Spanish or other languages," says De Brauwere, who speaks Spanish. Although the tracers De Brauwere works with currently have scripts in both languages, she says sometimes the people she calls speak only Vietnamese or Thai and need someone they can understand in order to be thoroughly traced as a contact. 6. Connect with other tracers — they've been in your shoes! New COVID-19 contact tracers might get overwhelmed jumping straight into this work, especially if they don't have a medical background — but veteran tracers like Saykpah have already successfully used contact tracing to break the chain of transmission before. And they have tons of expertise they're happy to share. In a time of global crisis, this cross-cultural conversation can go a long way in finding solutions and slowing the virus's spread. "Whenever there is some gap in information that you don't have or you are facing a challenge somewhere, engage with people who have already been involved in this work," Saykpah says. "Check in with us. We can share knowledge and work together."Credit:  NPR Widespread testing for the coronavirus is key to safely reopening the country, but the U.S. has struggled for months to get to the level of testing many experts say we need — even as states and cities begin to loosen restrictions. Part of the problem is that a test for the coronavirus is not a single device. Testing entails several different steps and requires supplies and pieces of equipment sourced from different places. These supplies have to make it from factories to testing sites where patients' samples can be collected and to the lab where tests are processed. Along the way, there can be shortages of various components, each one potentially creating a bottleneck. The most common kind of test to check for an active coronavirus infection takes a sample from the back of your nose or throat. There are dozens of varieties of that test, but they all require one key element: the swab. Even though health experts and governors were warning of swab shortages as early as February, the federal government took until late April to increase domestic production. That means that now, months into this crisis, we still need more of them. In this video, we zero in on the swab, detailing what the federal government and private industry did and didn't do, and we break down why testing is so complicated in the first place.

             President Trump holds a mask as he speaks during a tour of the Ford Rawsonville Plant in Ypsilanti, Mich., on Thursday. On this Memorial Day weekend, beaches have reopened and people are venturing outside. And images and videos have circulated of some crowded beaches, pools and boardwalks in Maryland, Florida, Missouri, Texas and California. And many people didn't heed warnings and weren't wearing masks. It's perhaps not surprising when you consider President Trump — who as president sets the tone for so much of the country, especially for his supporters — has refused to be seen wearing a mask publicly. "I had one on before," Trump said last week at a Ford Motor Co. plant in Michigan. "I wore one in this back area. I didn't want to give the press the pleasure of seeing it."  The "pleasure" of seeing it? It's odd that, as the country approaches 100,000 deaths from the coronavirus, the president would feel wearing a mask was somehow something the press might mock him for, especially when his own administration's guidelines say to wear one when out in public and within 6 feet of someone. It's important to remember that Trump is the one who changed the narrative on wearing masks in the first place. It wasn't that long ago that his administration was recommending that healthy people not wear masks, so supplies weren't scarce for health care workers and first responders who needed them. Then it was Trump who told people that wearing face coverings and scarves could make a big difference. So this idea emerging that being seen wearing a mask somehow is a virtue signal for which party you belong to — and some thinking it infringes on their civil liberties or makes them look weak — is just not helpful to stopping the spread of the virus.  Many Republican leaders are saying so, too. "If someone is wearing a mask, they're not doing it to represent what political party they're in or what candidates they support," North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, a Republican, said in an emotional statement Friday. His voice started to break and he started to tear up, as he continued, "They might be doing it because they've got a 5-year-old child who's been going through cancer treatments. They might have vulnerable adults in their life, who currently have COVID and they're fighting." In a tearful speech, Gov. @DougBurgum (R-ND) asks residents to skip the “ideological and political” debate on face masks. pic.twitter.com/BkTEDWxuYg Similarly, Republican Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine said Sunday on NBC's Meet the Press: "This is not about politics. This is not about whether you are liberal or conservative, left or right, Republican or Democrat." Dr. Stephen Hahn, head of the Food and Drug Administration, tweeted a warning Sunday that "the coronavirus is not yet contained" and he reminded Americans that "social distancing, hand washing and wearing masks protect us all." With the country starting to open up this holiday weekend, I again remind everyone that the coronavirus is not yet contained.  It is up to every individual to protect themselves and their community.  Social distancing, hand washing and wearing masks protect us all. Also on Meet The Press, the president's national security adviser, Robert O'Brien, shifted the focus from health to the economy, making the argument to wear a mask this way: "Mask usage is going to help us get this economy reopened." Maybe that's an argument that will stick with the president, and one — if he's convinced — he can translate to his conservative base, which has grown increasingly more concerned with reopening businesses than the health impact of COVID-19.  But that's a big if. 1. 100,000 coronavirus deaths: It's a staggering number, but the country is approaching 100,000 deaths attributed to COVID-19. It's something that was seemingly unfathomable two to three months ago. "You have 15 people, and the 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero," Trump said on Feb. 26. A month later, in late March, he downplayed the deadliness of coronavirus again, saying 36,000 on average die from the flu every year: "So you say to yourself, 'What is this all about?' " At that point, just over 700 Americans had died from COVID-19.  States are reopening, and experts are concerned about potential spikes, especially if people flout social distancing restrictions the way some did this weekend.   Loading...

Joe Biden fallout: This week will be notable for whether Biden's remark Friday that "you ain't black" if you don't vote for him over Trump has legs beyond just yet another gaffe from the former vice president. It's exactly the kind of thing veteran Democratic strategists worried about with Biden as the nominee. Trump, of course, has his own history of inflaming racial tensions and divides and, at the end of the day, either Trump or Biden will be elected president, and black voters will have to decide who best represents them. Biden was already under pressure to pick a black woman for his running mate. How this controversy goes may make that more likely. [Starting Tuesday, check out our special series on voting amid a pandemic.] 3. Trump goes to Baltimore, but its mayor doesn't want him there: Trump on Monday will participate in a Memorial Day ceremony at Baltimore's Fort McHenry. But the city's mayor said he doesn't think Trump should come. "We don't need to be spending our resources for the president who's coming here under our orders to stay at home. I think he's violating the law," Mayor Jack Young said last week.  Trump didn't win any friends in Baltimore last year, when he referred to the late Rep. Elijah Cummings' district in Baltimore as "a disgusting, rat and rodent infested mess." 4. Speaking of going places others aren't supposed to...: Trump and Vice President Pence are scheduled to go to a NASA/SpaceX launch in Florida on Wednesday. But on May 1, NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine urged Americans to stay away due to coronavirus concerns. "We're asking people not to travel to Kennedy [Space Center], but to watch online or watch on your television at home," he said.  It wouldn't be the first time the president has flouted his own administration's public guidance and declined to set an example. Trump is eager to show a country getting back to normal so he can tout improvement ahead of his reelection bid. 5. House vote on FISA bill: The House is expected to vote on renewal of key surveillance legislation Wednesday or Thursday, after the Senate passed it easily earlier this month.  There have been disagreements over just how much privacy the bill provides, with some saying it doesn't do enough and the Justice Department objecting to some changes that were made, saying they "would unacceptably degrade our ability to conduct surveillance of terrorists, spies and other national security threats." It's also not clear what the president thinks of the legislation. This may also be the first time the House votes by proxy, after approving those historic changes recently. "The vice president shouldn't have said it, but I really think the gall and the nerve of President Trump to try to use this in his campaign, he who has since day one done everything in his power, supported by his enablers, to divide this country, particularly along racial lines." — Rep. Val Demings, D-Fla., on CNN Sunday responds to Biden's "you ain't black" comments. Demings is being vetted as Biden's potential running mate.

             Denise and Richard Victor of Bloomfield Hills, Mich., have been missing their grandkids, whom they haven't seen since February. Before the pandemic, they had regular visits with grandsons (from left) Daren Cosola, Stirling Victor, Davis Victor and Lucas Cosola. Back in pre-pandemic times, Richard and Denise Victor would get to see their four grandchildren almost every day. One set of kids lives around the block from them in Bloomfield Hills, Mich.; the others are half an hour away, all close enough for frequent visits and sleepovers. "With the younger ones, we have a routine of stories when they spend the night," Richard Victor says. But when the coronavirus hit, the couple were at their vacation home in Florida, and suddenly it wasn't safe to leave. They've been sheltering there for three months, missing their grandkids and struggling with an absence that FaceTime just can't fill. "It's very, very difficult," says Victor, a 70-year-old lawyer and founder of the nonprofit Grandparents Rights Organization. "You have to try your best, because we don't know when this will be over with." Of all the hardships imposed by the coronavirus pandemic, among the most poignant is the reshaping of relationships between children and the grandparents who love them. Across the U.S., where more than 70 million people are grandparents, the effort to prevent infection in older people, who are most at risk of serious COVID-19 illness, has meant self-imposed exile for many. On the other hand, some grandparents have taken over daily child care duties to help adult children who must work. "All the grandparents in the country are aching," says Madonna Harrington Meyer, a sociology professor at Syracuse University in New York. "Some are aching because they can't see their grandchildren — and some are aching because they can't get away from them." Both situations are the result of a fast-moving pandemic that forced families to decide quickly whether to isolate with grandparents "inside the bubble or out," Harrington Meyer says. Three months later, many are still grappling with those decisions — and worrying about an uncertain future. "I think we all have the exact same set of issues," says Harrington Meyer, author of the 2014 book Grandmothers at Work: Juggling Families and Jobs. "What will August bring? All of us need to be prepared for this to be fluctuating." Even as some regions begin easing restrictions, the risks posed by gathering in person haven't changed for grandparents separated from their grandchildren, says Dr. Krutika Kuppalli, an affiliated clinical assistant professor of medicine in the infectious diseases division at Stanford University. Rates of serious illness and death caused by COVID-19 remain much higher in older people than among the young, and children can easily spread the disease. "It's hard to know if a child has been exposed or whether they have an asymptomatic infection," Kuppalli says. "I would definitely recommend staying away or definitely continuing to wear masks and perform good hand hygiene." At the same time, maintaining a connection with grandkids is important for the well-being of everyone, says Dr. Preeti Malani, chief health officer and professor of medicine at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. "There's an incredible health benefit to them to interact with their grandparents," she says. The bond is special. In Highland Beach, Fla., Victor says he and wife, Denise, who's in her 60s, have relied heavily on Zoom, FaceTime and videos to stay connected to their grandchildren. Still, it has been difficult. Since February, the two older boys, ages 10 and 13, have gotten taller and better at basketball. The baby has gone from crawling to walking. And their precocious 4-year-old grandson has paid close attention to the passing time. "He let me know I'd been gone long enough that he's not 4 1/2 anymore. He's 4 3/4," Victor says. "We miss them all so much." Some grandparents have calculated that the need to care for their families outweighs the fear of infection. Fran Layton, 73, a lawyer who lives in Berkeley, Calif., rushed to pick up her 2-year-old grandson in San Francisco in late March when his newborn sister arrived earlier than planned. "My son called and said, 'Mom, they're going to induce. Can you get here?' I did not hesitate," Layton recalls. She kept the toddler for a couple of days at that time. A month later, with her region under stay-at-home restrictions, she started caring for him at her home a few days each week so his parents could juggle work and the new baby. "He would take his naps in a stroller in the afternoon," Layton says. "I walked the Berkeley Hills while he napped. It got me my exercise." Recently, though, Layton's son and daughter-in-law decided to return to using their son's nanny. Layton agreed with that decision but also knew that this would widen the circle of infection risk for her. For now, she is choosing to stay away and doesn't know when she'll be together again with her grandson — or her new granddaughter. "I was a mess when he left," she says. "It's sadness that we all feel forced apart — with children and grandchildren." Some grandparents continue to see their grandchildren in person, finding ways to stay apart while still being together. "The outdoors is safer than the indoors, in general," says Malani, the University of Michigan professor. "To me, a walk in a park, without a play structure, without other kids around, is OK." About 4% of grandparents live with their grandchildren, so staying away isn't an option. As of mid-May, Beth Kashner had joined that group. Her daughter's family, including an 11-year-old granddaughter and 10-year-old grandson, relocated from Brooklyn to Kashner's large Seattle home "while normal life is on hold," or at least for the summer. "They even brought their two cats," says Kashner, 73. "I'm really happy that everyone will be part of the same safe community." Kashner already lived less than a mile from her four other grandchildren, who range in age from 3 to 10. For weeks, she saw them only from afar. Now, the whole family is gathering. It may be risky, but they're taking pains to stay as safe as possible, she says. "We did just go to the park wearing masks and trying to keep our distance," she says. For those who must be physically close to their grandchildren, there are ways to reduce the risk. Frequent hand-washing and sanitizing of high-touch surfaces are essential. Avoid prolonged contact with those outside the household. Masks and gloves can help. And it's not just the little ones. Adult grandchildren must consider carefully how to visit their grandparents too. Malani recently took her family to visit her 97-year-old grandmother, Haridevi Malani. "It was a bit of a dilemma," she says. "But I had a need to go visit her." Until a treatment or vaccine for the coronavirus is available, every interaction will be fraught with questions, she says. Going forward, families will need to weigh risks and benefits. "We're not going to have a situation where we can mitigate the risk to nothing," Malani says. "It's about how much risk you're willing to take." Kaiser Health News is a nonprofit, editorially independent program of the Kaiser Family Foundation. KHN is not affiliated with Kaiser Permanente.

             Farmers harvest opium sap from a poppy field in the Nangarhar province of Afghanistan on May 10. The country is the world's biggest heroin supplier, but a U.N. report found a shortage of field workers there because of the coronavirus. The coronavirus pandemic has disrupted the illegal drug trade in ways not seen since World War II, affecting nearly every country and many different kinds of drugs, according to a report compiled by the United Nations. "It's a completely different scale," said lead researcher Angela Me, who works with the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime, in Vienna. She said small-scale disruptions are common in the illegal drug trade but the chaos seen in recent months is nearly unprecedented. "Here everything has been disrupted," she added. In many ways, turmoil in the black market for narcotics and other drugs appears to mirror the pandemic's impact on legal industries struggling with labor and transportation. It's harvest season right now in the poppy fields of Afghanistan, the world's biggest heroin supplier, but the U.N. report found a sudden shortage of field workers. "The harvest involves more than a hundred thousand people," Me said, noting Afghanistan sealed its border with Pakistan in March because of the virus. "Much of this labor force comes from other countries and it's kind of a labor migration in a very short period of time." Border restrictions and stay-at-home orders around the world have also made it harder for producers to acquire the so-called "precursor chemicals" needed to manufacture drugs like heroin and methamphetamines. "The drug we're seeing the most disrupted is methamphetamine," said Uttam Dhillon, acting administrator of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. DEA field offices across the country are seeing the supply shortages and rising prices. Cartels in Mexico are also struggling with transportation of drug profits. "There's a perceived increase in police presence associated with the stay-at-home orders," Dhillon told NPR. "You couple that with the border shutdowns, it makes it more difficult to move drugs north and money south." According to the DEA, one drug that remains widely available in much of the U.S. is fentanyl, a synthetic opioid. That's alarming because the U.N. report points out that during past disruptions of the drug trade, people shifted from heroin to fentanyl, resulting in more overdoses. 
                Tablets believed to be laced with fentanyl are displayed at the Drug Enforcement Administration Northeast Regional Laboratory on Oct. 8, 2019, in New York. According to the DEA, one drug that remains widely available in much of the U.S. is fentanyl, a synthetic opioid.

             Tablets believed to be laced with fentanyl are displayed at the Drug Enforcement Administration Northeast Regional Laboratory on Oct. 8, 2019, in New York. According to the DEA, one drug that remains widely available in much of the U.S. is fentanyl, a synthetic opioid. Indeed, this kind of upheaval in the illegal drug trade has happened before. David Courtwright, a historian who studies drug trafficking and substance abuse disorder, says many heroin users started taking riskier drugs during World War II. "The government started buying up the opium supply even before the United States entered the war, in anticipation of military medical needs," Courtwright said. "When the war broke out, of course smuggling routes were disrupted. It became really hard to get hold of drugs." Amid today's pandemic, drug traffickers are already adapting. The U.N. found more local women working in Afghanistan's poppy fields, for example, replacing workers who couldn't travel. Cartels appear to be shifting from air and land transport to shipments by sea to bring product from Mexico into the U.S. But in some parts of the world, U.N. researchers found drug markets are reeling as trafficking routes shut down. Coca leaf prices in Peru dropped by nearly half because of "decreasing demand by traffickers who have had difficulties in transporting the drug," the report said. Italy and the United Kingdom also saw street-level drug markets dry up, meaning higher prices. The DEA's Dhillon said he hopes some of this disruption can be sustained after the threat of COVID-19 passes. "The challenge for DEA and all of law enforcement is to learn from what was in place at the time during the pandemic and see if we can enhance that so that in the future we can keep these drugs from coming in," he said. That might include continuing heightened restrictions at ports of entry, Dhillon added. Meanwhile, experts say when drugs are harder to find and more expensive, more people do seek treatment. But finding help can be challenging right now, when quarantine rules have restricted access to many clinics and hospitals that are often the first point of contact for those struggling with addiction.From NPR's Embedded: The workers who produce pork, chicken, and beef in plants around the country have been deemed "essential" by the government and their employers.

             Floyd Van Alstyne, 100, and his wife, Marjorie Van Alstyne, 92, live on a farm in East Barnard. Vermont is a state of vast beauty, yet for all its idyllic Green Mountain landscapes, living there takes a certain amount of grit. The state's bitter winters can last as long as six months, only to be followed by "mud season" – the character-building preamble to spring that turns the ground to sludge and makes dirt roads impassable. In the best of times, a healthy portion of the year in rural Vermont requires a type of isolation and self-sufficiency unknown in many parts of the country. But the coronavirus has tested Vermonters like never before. The virus can be particularly dangerous for the elderly, and Vermont's population is the third oldest by median age in the nation. In March, Governor Phil Scott issued state-of-emergency orders designed to keep people in their homes. Thinking it an essential moment to document, photographer Tara Wray, a Vermont transplant from Kansas by way of New York City, traveled through her community to take portraits — through windows and from a safe distance — of her older neighbors. She also spoke with them about how they're coping in the age of social distancing. Here is what they shared.

Camp is also caregiver to his wife, Kay, 82, a licensed funeral director who suffered a brain injury seven years ago. Camp is a fourth generation Vermonter and active at the Thompson Senior Center in the town of Woodstock, where he calls fellow seniors to check up on them during the COVID-19 pandemic, among other duties. "People are much more talkative lately," he says, attributing it to the loneliness that comes with living in lockdown.

At 96 years old, Sarah Foss can still be seen behind the wheel of her Ford, which she drives all throughout Vermont's Upper Valley — a region along the Connecticut River that runs the state's border with New Hampshire. Foss regularly does volunteer work to help other seniors and members of the community, including grocery shopping and errands for people who can't drive. She recently helped serve meals to more than 90 people at LISTEN Community Services, a non-profit in White River Junction that supports individuals and families in need. Foss has lived in Vermont for 60 years and says that despite the easing of certain restrictions, her life won't be any different until there's a vaccine. "The disease is all around," she says. "You can't see it, hear it, smell it. So I'll maintain lockdown."

             Retired nurse Anne Herz says the lockdown has helped her complete her spring cleaning earlier than usual. "I do miss seeing my family," she says. A retired nurse, Anne Herz, 84, of Woodstock says that social distancing has made her much more aware of how fortunate she is to live in Vermont and to appreciate the kindness of her neighbors. The lockdown helped her get her spring cleaning done earlier than usual, and has allowed her more time to enjoy the coming of spring. "I do miss seeing my family, but we have been able to meet (six feet apart) in the yard for a picnic or two," she says. "I don't think anything could have prepared us for this pandemic. It is just so different than anything most of us have had to experience. Realizing that there are so many people suffering and dying is hard to bear, but we will get through this together."

"Stay-at-home makes sense, as does social distancing," he says. "I don't think anybody can be quite prepared for a situation like we're in right now, but coping with it is certainly possible. I do see this situation lasting a long time ... so I'm sure that it will get old. Which means that we have to deal with the attendant problems now, psychological or otherwise."

"I don't like the pop, pop noises," Amor explains, swinging the beads in her hair. "I can't hear my tablet when I watch something."

"Sometimes she cries, sometimes she covers her ears." Her grandmother has even watched Amor hide inside a narrow gap between the couch and recliner.

             In communities across the United States this spring, families are dealing with more than just the threat of the coronavirus outside their homes. In the midst of violence that does not stop even during a pandemic, children like Amor continually search for safety, peace and a quiet place. "Safer at Home" slogans don't guarantee safety for them. More than two dozen parents and caregivers we spoke with attested that the kids hide underneath beds, in basements and dry bathtubs, waiting for gunfire to stop while their parents pray that a bullet never finds them. In St. Louis, which has the nation's highest murder rate among cities with at least 100,000 people, the reasons are especially stark. More than 20 children in the St. Louis area were killed by gunfire last year, and this year at least 10 children have died already. While some of the children's deaths were caused by accidental shootings inside a home, regular gunfire outside is a hurtful reminder that adults have to find ways to keep children safe. And while parents hope their kids grow into healthy adults, evidence shows that children who grow up around violence or witness it frequently are more likely to have health problems later in life. Although the mental health of children around the world has been taxed these past few months, for some children the stress has been going on far longer. Regularly hearing shootings is one example of what's called an "adverse childhood experience." Americans who have adverse childhood experiences that remain unaddressed are more likely to suffer heart disease, cancer, chronic respiratory diseases and stroke, according to a 2019 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report. St. Louis mental health counselor Lekesha Davis says children and their parents can become desensitized to the violence around them — where even one's home doesn't feel safe. And, research shows, black parents and children in the U.S., especially, often cannot get the mental health treatment they may need because of bias or lack of cultural understanding from providers. "Can you imagine as a child, you are sleeping, you know, no care in the world as you sleep and being jarred out of your sleep to get under the bed and hide?" Davis asks. "We have to look at this, not just, you know, emotionally, but what does that do to our body?" she adds. "Our brain is impacted by this fight-or-flight response. That's supposed to happen in rare instances, but when you're having them happen every single day, you're having these chemicals released in the brain on a daily basis. How does that affect you as you get older?" Still, future health problems are hard to think about when you're trying to survive. 
                The program's assistant director, Tawanda Brand, works with students at the Little Explorers Learning Center in St. Louis on Jan. 29. After closing temporarily because of the coronavirus, the center re-opened in May for the children of essential workers. All staff members now wear masks.

             At this day care center, 'Dora' means drop The children at Little Explorers Learning Center are getting reacquainted with their daily routine now that the day care facility has reopened for families of essential workers as the COVID pandemic stay-at-home orders loosen. And there's a lot to remember. Teachers at the center remind the children of their hand-washing, meal time and academic routines. They also make sure the kids remember what to do when gunfire erupts nearby. Assistant director Tawanda Brand runs a gunfire safety drill once a month. First, she tells the children to get ready. Then, she shouts: "Dora the Explorer!" 
                Justice Buress, 4, demonstrates how she drops to the floor when she hears her teacher call out "Dora the Explorer" during monthly drills at Little Explorers Learning Center.

             "Dora" is a code word, Brand explains, signaling the kids to drop to the floor — the safest place — in case gunfire erupts nearby. During a drill one morning before the pandemic, most of the children got down. Others walked around, sending Brand on a chase as she tried to corral the group of 3- to 5-year-olds. The drill may sound playful, but sometimes the danger is real. The Little Explorers protocol isn't like the "active shooter" drills that took place in schools around the country on the rare chance someone would come inside to shoot — as at Columbine, Parkland or Sandy Hook. The day care program performs these drills because nearby shootings are an ongoing threat. Day care director Tess Trice says a bullet pierced the window in November while the children were inside. Then, the very next day, bullets flew again. "We heard gunshots, we got on the floor," Trice says. "Eventually, when we got up and looked out the window, we saw a body out there." 
                Tess Trice owns and runs the Little Explorers Learning Center. A bullet pierced the day care center's window in November while the children were inside, she says, then bullets flew again the next day. Trice was photographed on Jan. 29, before the Center temporarily closed; it re-opened in early May for the children of essential workers, and all staff members now wear masks.

             Trice called parents that day to see if they wanted to pick up their children early. Nicollette Mayo was one of the parents who received a call from the teachers. She knows the neighborhood faces challenges, but can't see her 4-year-old daughter, Justice, and infant son, Marquis, going anywhere else. "I trust them," Mayo says. "And I know that, God forbid, if there is an incident that I'm going to be contacted immediately. They're gonna do what they need to do to keep my children safe." Trice considered bulletproof glass for the day care center but could not afford it. A local company estimated it would cost $8,000 to $10,000 per window. So she relies on the "Dora" drills and newly installed cameras. 'You live better if you sit on the floor' In a city with such an alarming homicide rate, such drills aren't happening only at the few day care facilities that have reopened. They also happen at home. Long before the coronavirus pandemic pushed the world to isolate at home, the Hicks family had their own version of sheltering in place. But it was from gun violence. When they hear gunshots outside their home in East St. Louis, Ill., everyone hides in the dark. 
                Anajah Hicks, 13, demonstrates the position she's been taught to take when she hears gunshots. Her mom and grandmother make sure the teen and her siblings practice getting on the floor quickly to stay safe.

             Anajah Hicks, 13, demonstrates the position she's been taught to take when she hears gunshots. Her mom and grandmother make sure the teen and her siblings practice getting on the floor quickly to stay safe. The goal is to keep the family out of sight, because bearing witness to a shooting could put them at a different kind of risk, mom Kianna Hicks says. So when trouble erupts, they do their best to remain unseen and unheard. "We turn the TV down," says 13-year-old Anajah Hicks, the oldest of four. "We turn the lights off, and we hurry up and get down on the ground." A few times each month, the family practices what to do when they hear gunshots. Hicks tells the kids to get ready. Then, their grandmother Gloria Hicks claps her hands to simulate the sound of gunfire. "I need them to know exactly what to do, because in too many instances, where we've been sitting around, and gunshots, you know, people start shooting, and they'll just be up walking around or trying to run," Kianna Hicks says. "I'll tell 'em, 'Naw, that's not what you do. You hear gunshots, you hear gunshots. No matter where you at, you stop — you get on the ground and you wait until it's over with and then you move around.' " And this summer, Hicks wants to make sure the kids are ready. At least twice a week in past years when the weather warmed up, the family got on the floor in response to real gunfire. Violence spikes in summer months, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. And she knows they could be spending more time in the house if football camp for her boys is canceled because of coronavirus fears. Other families in tough neighborhoods sit on the floor more often, even amid moments of relative quiet. The first time Gloria Hicks saw a family sitting on the floor, she was visiting her godson in Chicago decades ago. It was hot that summer, Hicks recalls, so families kept their apartment doors open to stay cool. "They were sitting on the floor watching TV and I wondered, Why is it like that?" Hicks recalls. "Then I learned that you live better if you sit on the floor than on the couch, because you don't know when the bullets gon' fly." 'I immediately dropped to the floor' Although 16-year-old Mariah knows what to do when bullets fly, she says, she still has a difficult time processing the sound of violence. The honor student was babysitting her little cousins at her St. Louis home last winter when she heard gunshots. "It couldn't have been no further than, like, my doorstep," says Mariah, whose mother asked that the teen's last name not be printed so the discussion of the trauma doesn't follow her into adulthood. "I immediately dropped to the floor, and then in a split second the second thing that ran through my head is like, 'Oh, my God, the kids.'" When Mariah walked into the next room, she saw her two younger cousins on the floor doing exactly what their mother had taught them to do when gunfire erupts. Get down and don't move. "I was so worried," Mariah recalls. "They're 6 and 3. Imagine that." The three kids walked away physically OK that day. But later that night, Mariah says, she pulled out strands of her hair, a behavior associated with stress. "Pulling my hair got really bad," she says. "I had to oil my hair again, because when I oil it, it makes it hard to pull out." 
                Mariah and her mom, Eisha Taylor, at their home in St. Louis in early February. The teen was babysitting her young cousins last winter when they heard gunshots on the street. "I was so worried," Mariah recalls. "They're 6 and 3. Imagine that."

             Davis, the mental health counselor who has worked for 20 years with children experiencing trauma, encourages parents to comfort their kids after a traumatic event and for the kids to fully explore and discuss their emotions, even months after the fact. She says getting on the floor explains only how families are maintaining their physical safety. "But no one's addressing the emotional and the mental toll that this takes on individuals," says Davis, vice president of the Hopewell Center, one of the few mental health agencies for kids in the city of St. Louis. "We get children that were playing in their backyard and they witnessed someone being shot right in front of them," Davis says. "These are the daily experiences of our children. And that's not normal." This story comes to NPR as part of a partnership with Kaiser Health News. Carolina Hidalgo contributed to this report as a journalist at St. Louis Public Radio.

This produce, and more, will be distributed in favelas, poor urban neighborhoods where residents live in crowded homes and lack basic sanitation. In Brazil's favelas, poor urban neighborhoods where residents live in crowded homes and lack basic sanitation, the toll of the coronavirus is expected to be brutal. The informal jobs that sustain 39 million Brazilians, such as selling street food or working temporary construction gigs, are also victims of the stay-at-home order, which started in mid-March. For some in these sprawling settlements, hunger is a threat as real as COVID-19.

             The favela Brasilândia is the city district with the most deaths in São Paulo. Sao Paulo city (Sao Paulo is also the name of the state) is reporting roughly more than 3,000 confirmed COVID-19 deaths and another 3,000 suspected fatalities. The favela Brasilândia is the city district with the most deaths, 156 confirmed or suspected, at last count. "As COVID-19 is wreaking havoc on our food systems, we are seeing a rollback in progress, not only in Brazil, but across the world," says Agnes Kalibata, special envoy, U.N. Food Systems Summit. "The already undernourished will become even more so as healthy food becomes more expensive."

Unsold produce often goes to waste; Duckur wants to bring the surplus to those who need it. Small producers like Duckur mostly rely on the community-supported agriculture (CSA) model, selling directly to consumers on a small scale. The pandemic has meant the loss of some business — sales to public schools and restaurants, for instance — but their customer base is solid. Unsold produce goes to waste, however, as a matter of course.

Since launching Pertim, Duckur and Altenfelder have helped three other groups form. The four groups say they have distributed more than 400 boxes of food in four favelas. Pertim buys food from the growers to fill the boxes sent to the favelas. "The same basket that goes for payers, goes out as donations," says Duckur. Each box contains fruits, eggs, vegetables, coffee and other organic products — even cloth face masks made locally.

Pertim is supported by cash donations and by selling what Duckur calls "Robin Hood" baskets to those who can afford them. The idea is that the cost of buying two such baskets will also provide funds that enable the farmers to give away one free box of food to the favelas. Brasilandia, with 280,000 people, is the fourth-most populous district in the outskirts of Sao Paulo. There, Pertim is aided by Dimas Reis, a favela resident who is cofounder of a collective working to improve the lives of residents and by a health agent (kind of like a social worker) who finds families who need the boxes.

"It's great to make that link from the farm to the city and reestablish people's connection to food," Reis says. The logistics of collecting, preparing and distributing the baskets is complex and time-consuming, and Pertim is improving procedures as they go. The food has to be picked up from the producers in a roughly 25-mile range, and cleaned. Then it's trucked to the favela, where volunteers sort the goods into individual boxes.

             The first batch of handwritten cards and letters, awaiting USPS pickup in the mailbox. A week into California's stay-at-home order, when our now-familiar mix of anxious, lonely and restless feelings were still brand new, I craved connection. But not the kind available from a screen. Inside my wallet I found 10 stamps leftover from the holidays, and I put out a tweet: "Today I am going to write letters to send through the post ... [Direct message] me your snail mail address if you want a random letter. But heads up I only have 10 stamps & they are of Santa." On the first day, I wrote to strangers in Arizona, California, Missouri, New York, Texas and Washington. The next day, I wrote to an 11-year-old who was born in Plano, Texas, where I grew up. I wrote to a USPS letter carrier from Minnesota who requested a letter for himself. The 10 stamps ran out quickly, so I restocked. By the time I was finished sending an analog paper letter to anyone who requested one, I'd written 50 letters to addresses in every state except for Alaska and the Dakotas.  When they requested letters, people mentioned little bits about themselves: That they live in my old stomping grounds (Austin and St. Louis). They mentioned their kids or their pets. They mentioned listening to NPR when I broadcasted from Seoul. They mostly asked if it was too late to request a letter. A handful of requests came from longtime friends. It tickled me that folks who can call me easily wanted this kind of expression of love, all the same. They — and the others — were clearly as eager to connect as I was, amid stay-at-home orders brought on by this disorienting global pandemic. 
                People wrote back, with kind and lengthy cards and letters.

             People wrote back, with kind and lengthy cards and letters. These days, we're stripped to our most primal longings to survive. And survival for humans means connection and communion wherever we can find it. It might be especially crucial for my generation. A quarter of millennials said in a YouGov survey last year that they have no acquaintances; 27% reported having no close friends and 30% said they had no best friends. And that was before the crisis hit.  I am "very online," so it's obviously much easier reach far more than one person at a time with a tweet or an Instagram post. I could have simply sent personalized emails to everyone who asked. But the process of sitting down to compose a letter by hand, addressing an envelope and stamping it is infused with extra intention. It felt like a way to show an old-fashioned kind of caring, the kind that could pierce through the distance and approximate a hug. I wanted to be explicit in signaling the letters came from a real human, and nothing automatic, so finding ways to personalize each one was key. When I ran out of my personal stationery, I found my four-year-old daughter Isa's doodles in a notebook and wrote my letters on those pages. Our lives are upended, uncontrollable and contained by the walls of our homes. So when I wrote, I asked folks what their experience of this cocooning felt like. Were they scared and uncertain, like me? How did they fill their days? Find joy? I asked many people what they learned about themselves during this difficult period. 
                When stationery ran out, pages with my daughter's doodles sufficed.

             When stationery ran out, pages with my daughter's doodles sufficed. I didn't share quotes or poems, as I sometimes do when I send cards or letters to friends. Instead, I wrote about the rhythms and happenings of my days. I wrote about Isa singing full-throated the entire time she was on the back of a tandem bike with her dad. I wrote about how happy my neighbors are to see each other, and how we delight in shouted conversations from across the street. I wrote about how lonely I feel, even though I'm quarantined in a house with my family, which includes the seemingly nonstop volume of my three small children. And I let them know how writing these letters filled up my emotional tank, even though we didn't know one another.  I never expected replies. The satisfaction for me was in writing to people and knowing they'd receive something weird and rare. But the replies ended up being the best part. When the recipients got them in the mail, some of them didn't wait to write back by hand. They sent me direct messages on social media with photos of themselves and the letters now in their possession. Oscar in Santa Ana, Calif., said, "Handwritten anything is so special these days." Robert Howard in Austin quipped, "I got your note today in the mail and my wife was like, 'Someone named Elise wrote you from California ' and I was like, 'Oh [expletive], do I have a secret lover I don't know about?'" He went on to tell me how he and his wife were three days out from the arrival of their baby, and that they were on their way to pick up Texas BBQ-Asian fusion takeout.

             Robert Howard in Austin, with the letter I sent him. In the following weeks, Howard sent a letter by mail with a photo of the new baby and a personalized koozie with his phone number on it. He said he read a book once in which the author asked, "What if we really loved our neighbor as ourselves?" The author put his phone number in the back of the book. Howard was inspired and emulated the move with his number on the koozie to "make myself available to people and the world feel smaller." In addition to the tweeted and texted photos, I received dozens of handwritten replies. They came from Eldersburg, Md. And Kirkland, Wash. Tucson. Flushing, N.Y. Kearney, Mo. Fort Collins, Colo.  People wrote me about leaning into their hobbies and how they're spending their time — starting gardens, going on daily walks and sewing masks to donate to hospitals. Some of the replies were typed and printed out, with a Post-it note appended: "I ended up having so much to say, I typed it."  One couple from Arizona sent me, along with their letter, two national park brochures of the parks they live near, to help with my homeschooling of my children. A high school freshman wrote me back, sharing her love of playing guitar, singing and acting, but admitting no one at school even knows because "high school is hard. There's so much pressure to have a high social status."   A lot of letters included wishes for what comes out of this crisis. The one consistent hope was that the slower pace, deeper intention and attention we're paying to each other can continue in the next phase of our living history.

             Lizzie Chen in Austin sent her response on the most adorable stationery and included cards for other members of my family. So many of the feelings my pen pals shared with me mirrored my own. I wrote to them originally to process my fears and anxieties during this time. In the end, the respondents helped me remember the clarifying thing about this pandemic — that we're all part of one community of humans. For the duration of this crucible, and beyond, we should celebrate that which makes us most human: perspective, surprise and connection. Letters to strangers — and from strangers — can satisfy all three.It has been around two months of quarantine for many of us. The urge to get out and enjoy the summer is real. But what's safe? We asked a panel of infectious disease and public health experts to rate the risk of summer activities, from backyard gatherings to a day at the pool to sharing a vacation house with another household. One big warning: Your personal risk depends on your age and health, the prevalence of the virus in your area and the precautions you take during any of these activities. Also, many areas continue to restrict the activities described here, so check your local laws. And there's no such thing as a zero-risk outing right now. As states begin allowing businesses and public areas to reopen, decisions about what's safe will be up to individuals. It can help to think through the risks the way the experts do. "We can think of transmission risk with a simple phrase: time, space, people, place," explains Dr. William Miller, an epidemiologist at Ohio State University. Here's his rule of thumb: The more time you spend and the closer in space you are to any infected people, the higher your risk. Interacting with more people raises your risk, and indoor places are riskier than outdoors. Dr. Emily Landon, a hospital epidemiologist and infectious diseases specialist at University of Chicago Medicine, has her own shorthand: "Always choose outdoors over indoor, always choose masking over not masking and always choose more space for fewer people over a smaller space." Our experts shared their thoughts via phone and email interviews. Jump to an activity: backyard gathering; restaurant; worship service; beach or pool; outdoor party; public restroom; a friend using your bathroom; vacationing with another family; hotel; haircut; shopping mall; nightclub; camping; outdoor sports Meeting in a spacious outdoor area with only a small group isn't too risky. But our experts say that safety here depends on whom you invite and what their behaviors have been. "If you have a gathering with one other household that [has] followed social distancing, this would be a low-risk activity," says Dr. Judith Guzman-Cottrill, a pediatric infectious disease expert at Oregon Health & Science University. What alters risk? To lower risk, avoid sharing food, drinks or utensils — make it a BYO-everything party. Dr. Andrew Janowski, a pediatric infectious diseases expert at Washington University in St. Louis, notes that the food itself isn't the risk but touching shared dishes or utensils could be. Watch out for drinking, says Dr. Abraar Karan, a physician and public health researcher at Harvard Medical School, as it can make people sloppy about social distancing. It also increases the odds that people will want to use your bathroom. "Once you move into the house with others, the risk profile goes up," he says. Some experts suggest wearing a face covering, but Landon points out that you can't realistically stay masked while eating and drinking. She suggests an alternative to a meal would be a backyard lawn tournament: That way, "the kids can play together but still with their masks on." It could be fun for the grown-ups too. Indoor dining "is still amongst the riskier things you can do," Landon warns. The trouble is, says Miller, "people tend to linger in restaurants. So even if spacing is OK, the duration of exposure is longer." Also, he says, talking "appears to lead to some release of the virus." Karan notes that one outbreak in Guangzhou, China, took place in a restaurant with no windows and poor ventilation, and the air conditioning appears to have blown droplets between tables. What alters risk? Janowski says the risk level depends on how well the restaurant has adapted for the pandemic. Eateries should reduce and space out seating, require servers to wear masks and offer easy access to hand-washing stations. They should also provide single-use options for condiments so you don't have to touch shared ones, says Janowski. And they should close all self-serve areas like soda fountains or buffet tables. If you do go to a restaurant, look for outdoor seating. Landon says she would go with only members of her household, because "I don't want to have to take my mask off in the close proximity of a bunch of other people." Worship services involve people from different households coming together indoors for an extended time. "All of the ingredients are there for the potential for a lot of people becoming infected in the short amount of time," says Kimberly Powers, an epidemiologist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. She points to outbreaks linked to churches: In one, 35 out of 92 people who attended a service at a rural Arkansas church developed COVID-19. Singing — whether from the pews or the choir — is high risk, several experts noted, citing a study of a choir practice in Washington state where over half of attendees became infected. What alters risk: If people are appropriately socially distanced, wear masks and avoid singing, it may reduce the risk, Karan says. Also, avoid any shared worship items like hymnals, Janowski adds. Risk goes down if places of worship adapt, Guzman-Cottrill says. "My parish began having in-person services last week," she says. The church had advance sign-ups to limit attendance to 25 people. Attendees were required to be healthy, wear face coverings and sit at least 6 feet apart. As long as you can stay socially distanced, this could be a pretty safe activity, our experts say. The water itself is not a risk. "The sheer volume of water will dilute out the virus, making the water a highly unlikely source of infection," says Janowski. What alters risk? The key question is, how close are you to others? "Can you ensure that you can stay 6 feet [or more] from anyone outside of your designated family?" asks Rebecca Katz, director of the Center for Global Health Science and Security at Georgetown University Medical Center. Watch out for crowds at entry points and bathrooms. Maintain social distance both on land and in the water. Landon says her biggest worry about pools and beaches is kids. At pools, "they make friends with everyone," she says. "If you want to be able to see grandma for Sunday lunch, because that's what's really important to your family, then you don't want your kids running around with other people's kids." She says a beach is better than a pool in terms of space. Go early in the morning or late afternoon, when crowds are lower, and look for beaches that mark off spots for people to set up their areas. Family-oriented celebrations are usually a summer tradition, but they come with a lot of risk right now. Many weddings have been postponed, with good reason. "Outdoors reduces the risk, but as people are celebrating and drinking, it seems like they may not social distance as readily," says Karan, the Harvard physician. "These types of events end up being large crowds where people are having extended face-to-face conversations." The larger the guest list, the greater the potential that one of them is infected, says Powers, the UNC epidemiologist. What alters risk? The danger varies greatly depending on the size of the gathering and how closely people gather. If you are considering hosting a celebration, make it a small one with mostly local guests. "Bringing people from other communities" is high risk, says Landon, of the University of Chicago. "If people have to travel by car, by plane, from other places, you're really asking for it." And really think twice about inviting your relatives, particularly older family members or those with underlying conditions. People may feel pressure to attend, even though it's hazardous to their health — and even more so if you emphasize that you're going to try to make it safe, says Landon. One of the largest clusters of deaths from the virus in Chicago occurred after a funeral in which one of the attendees spread it to many of his family members. Restrooms have been designed to prevent disease transmission, says Landon: "There are all sorts of things that you can catch from other people's poop, and you almost never do, because they're set up with all hard surfaces that can be cleaned." The risk depends on the number of local COVID-19 cases and how clean the bathroom is, says Janowski of Washington University, noting that a bathroom involves multiple high-touch surfaces. There isn't yet sufficient data to know if there's risk from toilet flushes aerosolizing the virus. Landon says that other viruses, such as norovirus, can be aerosolized by flushing, but norovirus doesn't often spread that way as long as bathrooms are cleaned. The CDC says it's "unclear whether the virus found in feces may be capable of causing COVID-19." What alters risk: Miller says the main risk comes from restrooms that are small, busy and poorly ventilated — like "those restrooms in a gas station off the highway where the restroom is outside." Choose a bathroom that looks clean and is well stocked with supplies such as paper towels, soap and toilet paper. Avoid bunching up in a line to use the toilet or staying there long, if you're within 6 feet of others. Wash your hands after you go, and use hand sanitizer on them if you need to touch any surfaces after that. Landon doesn't think it's a big risk: "What happens in the bathroom is going to be sucked out of the bathroom ventilation, and you can clean all the hard surfaces really easily." Miller agrees: "You can run the fan, leave the door open after (so air flows) and clean the bathroom later. And if you use the bathroom after they do, just wash your hands." What alters risk? It's possible that your friend is infected but asymptomatic, says Janowski. "It would be reasonable to decontaminate the bathroom after a friend uses it, including cleaning the high-touch surfaces of the door, toilet and sink." Experts said that if both families have been quarantining and limiting their exposure to others, this is pretty safe. "If one family is very active or parents have higher-exposure jobs, then the risk increases," Miller says. Landon thinks this arrangement could be a good idea, especially if the house is "in the woods where you're not going to have a lot of contact with other people," she says. What alters risk? Landon suggests talking with the other family beforehand to make sure you share the same expectations for the precautions everyone will take in the two weeks before arrival and while you're there. Ensure that no one has signs of illness — if they do, they need to stay home. Miller recommends cleaning the major surfaces in the house on arrival. "And the more that people can reduce exposure in the days leading up to the trip, the better," he adds. The consensus is that staying at a hotel is relatively low risk, especially once you're in your room. It's best to limit your time in common areas such as the lobby, gym, restaurant and elevator, where the risk of exposure is higher. What alters risk? Bring disinfecting wipes to wipe down the TV remote control and other common surfaces. You might also want to remove the bedspread since it may not be cleaned after every guest, suggests Miller. Ask about the hotel's cleaning policies, as many have new COVID-19 protocols. "Beware of the elevators! Use the knuckle of your little or ring finger to press the buttons," says Miller. Other suggestions: Order room service rather than eating at the restaurant, avoid the exercise room and wear a face covering in public spaces. A haircut involves "close contact and breathing that is extended for several minutes," Karan notes. "This is the primary mode of transmission that we know happens. And cloth masks certainly are not perfect for this." Janowski says this is one of the highest-risk scenarios on this list, because there's no way to keep 6 feet from someone cutting your hair. "All it takes is [having] one asymptomatic but infected worker, and suddenly many customers are at high risk of infection," he says. What alters risk? Landon believes the risk is not terribly high if both you and your haircutter wear masks and if COVID-19 is not very prevalent in your area. Look for a salon or barbershop that has (and enforces) policies to protect its employees, like wearing protective gear and sanitizing hands, she says: "By protecting their employees, they're protecting you too." And make sure that your barber or stylist is all business, says Karan: "Stopping to chat at close distance like this is something we all love doing with our barbers normally. This is not the time for it." How risky this is depends on what kind of mall it is, how crowded it is and how much time you spend there, our panel agreed. "Crowds with high density lead to substantial increase in risk," says Miller. "The major mitigating factor is that people don't mingle in a single place for long." What alters risk? Outdoor malls are preferable to indoor ones. And empty malls are better than crowded ones. Avoid the food court and go with purpose, not leisure, says Landon: "As much as you may like retail therapy, you should browse online before you go. Know what you're going to pick up or try on. Wear your mask. Go in, look at it. Make your decision and get out." Be alert while you're there to avoid close contact. "Maintain your space," says Miller. "Try to go at off-peak hours." Bring hand sanitizer, says Guzman-Cottrill, and use it frequently, especially if you touch any shared surfaces like handrails or elevator buttons. There is consensus among the experts that going to a nightclub is a very high-risk activity. Crowds, ultra-close contact, singing, sweating and inhibition-loosening alcohol are a potent cocktail of risk factors. When drinking, people become less compliant with rules, Miller says, and they may breathe heavier from the dancing — "which means more virus is being shed," he says. If there's an infected person in the mix, the virus can spread easily. "This is a very high-risk situation for an outbreak, as we saw in South Korea just recently," says Karan, referring to an outbreak tied to several nightclubs and bars. "Don't go to bars or clubs right now." What alters risk? Nothing makes this a good idea right now. If you want to dance, have a dance party at home with the people in your intimate circle. If it's a small outdoor gathering, dancing under the stars — 6 feet apart — would be much less risky too. "As far as summer activities go, this is least risky from a virus perspective," says Katz, of Georgetown. You're outdoors and isolated. Miller agrees — but he says that if you're going with a group, be sure you can trust your fellow campers. Have they been social distancing and following the guidelines? If not, they could be asymptomatic spreaders of the virus. What alters risk? Of course, risks can creep in, depending on the particulars. "Are you camping in an isolated outdoor location with your family?" Katz asks — this is the lower-risk scenario. It's more dangerous if you're at a crowded campground with a shared restroom and communal picnic areas, she says. "Sleeping in tents together with others [not from your household] can certainly be a setup for transmission," adds Karan. Bottom line: The activity itself is low risk, but the people whom you'll be in close contact with during the trip could increase the hazard. Unless you're playing group sports, exercising outdoors is a good way to burn off steam while staying socially distant. Our experts agree that sports such as golf and tennis are safer than contact sports such as basketball and football. "I would personally avoid contact sports until we have a better sense of transmission risk here," Karan says. And running? "If you're not on a crowded path where people are brushing past each other, then I think that's a great form of exercise right now," says Powers. What alters risk? The more people involved in the activity, the higher the risk. It's possible to spread the virus when you're in close proximity to others — even if you're asymptomatic — so it's best to wear a mask if you can't stay socially distanced. The risk depends on the sport. A game like basketball is tricky, Landon says. "You're touching the ball and you're going to be breathing in each other's faces," so she suggests playing only with people in your household. Tennis carries a much lower risk: "You're far apart on either side. That's definite social distancing," she says.

             Town worker Steve Crowley washes and disinfects the public restroom at Mayflower Beach, in Dennis, Mass., last week. As stay-at-home restrictions are lifting, many people are concerned about using public restrooms. Toilet paper has been an issue since the start of the pandemic,  but now toilets themselves are the concern. As stay-at-home restrictions are lifting, many are feeling a long pent-up urge to go out, but what's stopping some is concern about their urge to go while they're out.  As in, use the bathroom. Loath to risk the germs in a public restroom, if they can even find one that's open, many are limiting their outings while others are getting creative. Shu Sanatani, a pediatric cardiologist in Vancouver, Canada, never used to think twice before going for his usual two- to three-hour run. Now, every time he heads out, he becomes kind of obsessed. "It's the anticipation of, 'What if I have to go to the bathroom?' " he said, mocking his usual panic. "Do I have to go to the bathroom? Uh oh, now I'm thinking about going to the bathroom, and now I feel like I have to go to the bathroom." Recently, his worst fears came to be. He really did have to go. His route took him by countless businesses that were closed, before he finally found a car mechanic's shop that was open. But the staff wouldn't let him in. "The panic grows as the third and fourth options exhaust themselves," he said. He was considering just going outside, then thought better of it. "I can't imagine it would be popular if someone saw me leaving my presumed viral sheddings somewhere in their petunias," he said with a laugh. So he changed his route and finally found a hospital that did let him in. It was a relief to him. But for many people, the prospect of using a public restroom is hardly comforting. Among those who cringe at the idea is Cheryl Bowlan, 69, who is moving from California to Portland, Ore., and will be driving the 12 hours with her husband. With all the planning and packing, she only recently realized she would have to use the public rest stops along the freeway. It left her just a little panicked. "I woke up early one morning and all of a sudden, ding, it occurred to me. Ick! Nasty!!" she recalled. "There are hundreds of people going through there every day, and I didn't want to do that." Experts say such fears are well-founded. "It's miserable. Disgustingly miserable," said Dr. Greg Poland, professor of medicine and infectious diseases at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. Just the fact that bathrooms tend to be highly trafficked and too cramped for social distancing makes them risky, he said. But on top of that, poor hand washing leaves doorknobs, faucets and other surfaces contaminated. And flushing the toilet can create a plume of vaporized germs up to 6 feet high, he said. While it's not yet proven the coronavirus can spread that way, it is known that other viruses can. "It really is a nightmare," said Poland. With all that going on, he said, "you have a bioweapons factory in [there.]" Some businesses are trying to adapt by installing touch-free doors, faucets and hand dryers, for example. Or they're switching to touch-free paper towel dispensers to avoid the possibility of hand dryers blowing coronavirus through the air — another potential, though not yet proven, risk. Businesses are also cleaning and disinfecting more frequently and requiring face masks to enter. Some are even hiring bathroom monitors to control crowds and enforce distancing. Steven Soifer, president of the American Restroom Association, which advocates for clean and safe public bathrooms, said many businesses are also installing dividers between urinals or closing down every other one. "There's a new term out there," he said. "It's called 'social piss-tancing.' " Soifer hopes the heightened awareness brought by COVID-19 will prompt what he sees as a long overdue overhaul of public restrooms. "We're advocating for more revolutionary toilet design with the single stall, fully enclosed water closets with toilet seats covers" that are typical in Europe, he said. "That would address many of the issues." But that would take more money than many businesses would want to invest, and more time than many people can wait, including Cheryl Bowlan. "It suddenly popped into my mind that I'll just do it in the car," she said. Bowlan is one of a growing number of women who have bought a portable urinal called the Feminal. It's an ergonomically correct canister with a screw cap, designed by urology nurse Linda Asta. Once a niche product for outdoorsy types or bedridden patients, it's now a mass-market, high-demand item. "All of a sudden sales have actually quadrupled in a month and a half," Asta said. There are also a slew of other urinals and portable potties for men and women on the market too, as well as feminine funnels, including the Go Girl and the Shewee. Adyn Sonju, a partner at The Tinkle Belle, said her product allows women to "go wherever the men go" and has what she described as a built-in squeegee feature that eliminates the need for toilet paper. "It's freeing to be able to go anywhere and know that you can just go when you need to go," Sonju said. "You just carry it with you like a portable restroom." The SaniGirl is a disposable option whose year-over-year sales sales are on track to triple this spring, according to founder Susan Thompson. She thinks the product will not only "change women's lives as they venture back out and start to get their lives back," but also may well change bathroom behavior forever, given the public's newly heightened awareness of germs and the "shock" of the pandemic. She adds that some customers even use it in public restrooms so they don't have to sit or touch as many surfaces. The portable products do carry their own risks if you don't hold them in place just right, so most manufacturers recommend practicing at home. You don't want your first try to be on the road or after a few drinks during a night out. But after a few (hopefully) dry runs at home, they say going on-the-go will be the safer way to go.

But hair continues to grow, even during stay-at-home orders. It's been months since most Americans have had a professional haircut. Salons have been shut down under stay-at-home orders to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus. In Los Angeles, the result has been a robust clandestine haircut scene. Carmelle began cutting hair out of her living room after the salon where she worked closed in mid-March. Her manager incorrectly informed her that she was not eligible for unemployment. She applied for jobs at grocery stores and delivery services but got nowhere. So, with no money coming in, she turned her house in Compton, Calif., into a salon and placed an ad on Craigslist. "I wasn't expecting a high volume at all," she said. "And when my phone had over 100 texts in one day, I was like, 'Oh my goodness, what am I gonna do?' [There are] a lot of people out there that [need] haircuts!"  Carmelle asked that her last name not be used for fear of losing her cosmetologist license. What she's doing is not allowed: Salons are still closed under California's stay-at-home order. Stylists who cut hair anyway could be penalized by the state Board of Barbering and Cosmetology. But Carmelle said she's doing nothing wrong. "Before you judge, put yourself in my situation first. My hands are tied," she said. The fear of disciplinary action is anxiety-provoking. Another LA-area stylist said she's completely drained after making a single home visit. She asked that her name not be used because she also fears losing her license. "It's like I need a nap," she said. "I did one person and I'm like, exhausted, when my average day was 12 people." People who get clandestine haircuts are anxious, too, but about something else. "The shaming," said Whitney Coss, an Angeleno who recently had her longtime stylist come to her home to cut and dye her hair on her back deck. "I've been shamed by strangers and friends for posting stuff online where I'm not just sitting at home." She decided to get her hair cut because she said she needed a little self-care right now. "I was like you know what? I need this. I need to feel good, I need to have a haircut, I need to do something that feels normal," she said. Unshorn government leaders  Public officials who look too groomed on camera also risk being shamed. At a recent meeting of the Orange County, Calif., Board of Supervisors, salon owner Melissa Sprout accused officials of getting haircuts on the sly while forcing salons to stay closed.  "As a hairstylist, I can see that many of you have had services done in the last six weeks. If politicians are using our services illegally, surely they find us essential," Sprout told the board. "I have not had my hair cut since well before this started," Supervisor Don Wagner shot back, "and if you want to get a close-up look, talk to me afterward." Reporters recently asked California Gov. Gavin Newsom about his hair at a press conference.  "I think it's pretty obvious to you I have not had a haircut," Newsom said. "I'm a little embarrassed having this conversation as publicly as I am having." Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti told reporters his wife is cutting his hair at home, with electric shears he bought on Amazon.  What Garcetti is doing may be safer than going to a salon, according to Seth Gordon Benzell, a postdoctoral associate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who recently wrote a paper examining the risk of reopening various kinds of businesses.  "What's really dangerous is people sitting around in crowded, small barber shops," Benzell said. But before you consider a home haircut, Benzell wants people to consider the trade-offs. It is worth it? he asked.  "You should ask yourself, "Do I really want to be spending my limited social contact budget on this? Or is there something more important I want to spend my very few human interactions that I'm allowing myself on?" Those in desperate need of a trim can always pay a barber to guide them, via FaceTime, while they cut their own hair. Thanks to the coronavirus, one Los Angeles stylist is now offering that service.

             The Spectrum Center in downtown Charlotte, N.C., is the site of the Republican National Convention in 2020. Two new polls out this week indicate a majority of Americans fear a "second wave" of COVID-19 cases in the near future, which may be washing away the chances for traditional presidential nominating conventions this year. A recent NPR/PBS/Marist poll found 77% of Americans were very concerned or concerned about a second wave of coronavirus. The next day, the Associated Press and NORC for Public Affairs Research reported that 54% of Americans were "very or extremely concerned" that lifting restrictions will result in new infections (with nearly another 30% somewhat concerned).  Federal health officials, including renowned infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci, have warned a resurgence of the virus is likely in the months ahead, possibly coinciding with flu season in the fall. It might also come earlier if the reopening of business reverses the current downward trend in new COVID-19 cases.  So at this point it is hard for convention planners to know whether the last two weeks in August would bring relative calm or a rerun of the outbreaks from March and April. And that has people wondering in the convention host cities of Milwaukee and Charlotte: As much as they wanted to host these events, is the price too high in terms of local residents' exposure?

             Democrats selected Milwaukee to host their 2020 national convention. Milwaukee was to host the Democratic convention in mid-July but the party's national committee agreed to postpone until the week of Aug. 17. That is the week before the Republicans are slated to gather in Charlotte. "We don't know yet what the new normal will be at the end of August," notes Harvey Gantt, the prominent Charlotte architect who served two terms as its first African American mayor in the 1980s. If people are contracting and dying from COVID-19 it makes no sense to go forward. Harvey Gantt "I'm not expecting the mayor or the city council to rescind the decision to host, not sure that's even an option," Gantt said. "But if a hurricane blew through here the week before, I think you'd see some reconsideration, and if people are contracting and dying from COVID-19 it makes no sense to go forward."   The 2016 national nominating conventions in Cleveland and Philadelphia each drew an estimated 50,000 people — nearly a third of them media personnel. Day and night for a week, throngs pulsed through sports arena hallways, hotel lobbies, meeting rooms and bars. It was great for the local economies, bringing in $180 million to each host city, according to the U.S. Travel Association and supporting thousands of jobs — at least temporarily.

             Hillary Clinton embraces President Obama after his address to the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia in 2016. Those dollars and jobs could scarcely be more welcome in any American city than they would be this summer. But it's also hard to imagine a more effective way to spread the virus, endangering not only the conventioneers but also the thousands of workers employed to set up, serve food and drinks, and clean up.  For the workers, the choice would be between their health and their job. "If 50,000 people come here they are going to have a disparate impact on this community and we will be left to pick up the pieces," says Mark Jerrell, an African American man serving in his first term on North Carolina's Mecklenburg County Board of Commissioners. "So if you are talking about $10 million in county revenue from taxes, what about the $20 million in medical bills we get as a result?" Jerrell's district on the County Board is, by his description, "one third African Americans, one third Caucasian and one third Hispanic, Asian or other." He makes it clear he thinks the area's people of color would be vulnerable. "There's no question some of our people are at a higher level of risk because of their lack of health care and the nature of the work they do," Jerrell said. "We've already seen a disproportionate share of the cases of COVID here in [Mecklenburg] County are people of color." Gantt made a similar point with respect to the convention and the virus.  "Ultimately the people running the convention itself have to be concerned about keeping their own people safe and seeing what precautions they need to take so that their delegates want to attend," said Gantt.  But he added their responsibilities also extended to the thousands of Charlotteans who would be servicing the convention and related events.  "They have to take care of our people, too," he said. "The onus will be on them to see that the people working that convention are safe." Pointed questions were being asked weeks ago at town halls and in social media in Milwaukee, too.  "At first a lot of local folks were really excited to have the convention here, to show off our city, our small businesses and black-owned businesses," said Angela Lang, executive director of Black Leaders Organizing for Communities in Milwaukee. "We also saw it as a chance to talk about the challenges here, especially in terms of black folks." Lang's organization was even helping recruit volunteers to work on the convention when the COVID-19 crisis hit and perspectives changed.   "At the end of the day we have to be sure people are safe," she said. "And when you look around you see the people who still have to go to work. Not only health workers but grocery store workers, truck drivers. One thing really clear in this pandemic is the class aspect to who's at risk. And when you paint the picture a lot of these people are black and brown." What Democratic and GOP leaders are saying To date, the official responses of the two parties have been so divergent that the two symbols are inadvertently made symbols of the country's political divide.  The Democratic National Committee is voting (by mail) on a proposal to leave final decisions about the convention to a state and local team of health and elected officials. But Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers, a Democrat, has said he expects the convention to move toward an essentially virtual mode. And the presumed nominee of the convention, former Vice President Joe Biden, has said he is fine with that or with a hybrid of in-person and virtual.  Polling has shown Democrats in general are more supportive of stay-at-home orders of all kinds, and a New York Times canvass of Democratic delegates entitled to vote at the convention found most would prefer not to hazard a face-to-face confab this year. So, while Milwaukee has waited a long time for its first  national major party nominating convention, it may just have to wait longer. The sentiment has been quite different on the Republican side, where polls and YouTube videos show active resistance to stay-at-home orders. The president has often reiterated his support for a traditional convention, and as recently as last week, officials for the convention and for the Republican National Committee reiterated they were moving "full speed ahead."  That may be the GOP's final word, or it may be bravado or even a negotiating position. The New York Times reported online Thursday that President Trump might not be as adamant about the Charlotte convention as has been assumed, citing unnamed aides suggesting the president had spoken of scaling back — or even moving the convention to Florida.  More likely than that would be a graduated compromise, possibly with a fraction of the human footprint. "People keep talking about 50,000," said Gantt. "We don't know that it will be that many, it may wind up being two or three thousand. Or maybe 21,000 spaced out in a very large facility."  That was very much like the solution proposed for the Democrats by Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who envisioned a ballpark with delegates six feet apart.  Moving out of Charlotte would seem the least likely scenario at this point. But it would surely flip the script on some in Charlotte who have noted the city has a contract with the Republicans that allows few exit ramps, if any. That contract was cited when, in 2019, some members of the City Council wanted to have a do-over vote on hosting the RNC. (The first was in 2018, and the tally was 6-5 in favor.) The do-over discussion followed a fiery rally Trump had held halfway across the state in Greenville, N.C., criticizing Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., and other women of color just elected to Congress. The crowd was seen national TV chanting "send her back."  One Charlotte city councilman, Braxton Winston, referred at that time to Trump as "an avatar of white supremacy." But the full council adjourned without reconsidering the vote it had taken the previous year.  Shared characteristics  Widely separated by geography and history, the two cities nonetheless share notable characteristics. The growing city of Charlotte is nearing 900,000 people and the surrounding Mecklenburg County adds another 200,000. The city of Milwaukee has fewer than 600,000 and its suburbs within Milwaukee County add another 350,000 (and still more in the counties beyond). In both cases, the core city has become increasingly African American and Hispanic as white residents over the past few generations decamped to the suburbs. Charlotte proper was 35% African American and 14% Hispanic in the latest census estimate. The comparable numbers in Milwaukee today are 40% and 17%.  Both cities have long histories of racially segregated neighborhoods, civil rights struggles and battles over the schools. In 2016, both cities saw violent street confrontations after the shooting deaths of young black men by police officers.  In Charlotte, six young men of color had been fatally shot, all but one by a white officer, in a six month period. But both cities have also seen their political leadership undergo a transformation. Since Gantt in the 1980s, Charlotte has become accustomed to having black mayors, including Anthony Foxx, who was later the U.S. secretary of transportation under President Obama. Vi Lyles, the current mayor, is the first black woman to hold the office. The Charlotte City Council has a black majority, as does the Mecklenburg County Board of Commissioners.  Milwaukee's population is actually more non-Anglo by percentage than Charlotte, although it has not yet elected a black mayor. State Sen. Lena Taylor, an African American woman, ran a strong second in the most recent mayoral race, losing to 16-year incumbent Tom Barrett (who was first elected over an African American alderman who was serving as acting mayor at the time).  In April of this year, state Rep. David Crowley became the first African American elected as Milwaukee County executive (a post once held by Scott Walker, who would later serve two terms as governor). And while the city's Common Council is divided almost equally between white and black aldermen (with two Hispanics), it has had several black council presidents, including the current president, Cavalier "Chevy" Johnson. Race may have been at least a subtle subtext of the choice of Milwaukee and Wisconsin to host the convention in 2020. While many factors contributed to Hillary Clinton's loss in the state in 2016, one was a sharp drop in voting in Milwaukee's black community. Some estimates have shown African American voting rates in the state down by nearly a fifth. About 7 out of 10 African Americans in the state live in Milwaukee, where turnout in the city proper   dropped 11 percentage points from Obama's last campaign in 2012.   It should be noted that elsewhere in the state 18 less populous counties that had voted twice for Obama switched to Trump in 2016. But the falloff in the Democratic tally in Milwaukee was more than enough to account for Clinton's 22,000-vote loss statewide. It was the first time a Democratic presidential candidate had failed to carry Wisconsin since 1984.

             An empty terminal at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport. The normally bustling check-in at the United Airlines terminal was eerily quiet on April 24. The summer travel season is kicking off this year with more uncertainty than any time in recent memory. The coronavirus pandemic has led millions of people to cancel vacation and travel plans. Airlines have lost billions of dollars in revenue, flying nearly empty planes and canceling tens of thousands of flights. The U.S. Travel Association said more than half of the industry's 15.8 million workers have lost their jobs, and the group forecasts spending on travel this holiday weekend will be about a third of last year's levels — $4.2 billion versus $12.3 billion in 2019. "Our national economy is in a recession, but the travel industry is already in a depression," U.S. Travel Association President and CEO Roger Dow said in a news release. "Travel-related businesses have been hit disproportionately hard by the pandemic's fallout, and unfortunately our workforce is on the front lines of that struggle." The uncertainty is so great, that for the first time in 20 years, AAA is not providing a forecast of how many people will be traveling over the Memorial Day weekend, traditionally the start of the summer vacation season. The organization said that "the accuracy of the economic data used to create the forecast has been undermined by COVID-19." Last year, 43 million Americans traveled for Memorial Day weekend, the second-highest travel volume on record in the two decades AAA has tracked the data. But this weekend, travel volume will likely be a fraction of that. "With social distancing guidelines still in practice, this holiday weekend's travel volume is likely to set a record low," said Paula Twidale, senior vice president of AAA Travel. Despite the dismal spring, there are signs that travel demand is beginning to tick up. In analyzing data from multiple sources, NPR finds signs that more Americans are not just looking to book future trips, but they're also boarding planes and starting to fly again.   Loading...

The Transportation Security Administration reports 318,449 people were screened at its airport security checkpoints across the country Thursday; that's the highest number in two months. The last time the number of people screened topped 300,000 was March 23. It's still 88% fewer travelers screened at TSA checkpoints than the 2.67 million screened on the Thursday before Memorial Day last year, but it's more than triple the number going through airports a month ago, on April 22, when fewer than 99,000 people went through TSA checkpoints. The industry group Airlines for America says through much of April, the number of passengers flying each day dropped to lows not seen since the dawn of the commercial jetliner era of the 1950s. Airlines have parked more than half of their fleets as the number of planes in the air has plummeted from more than 26,000 domestic flights a day in mid-March to almost one-fifth that number in late April, according to the site Flightradar24. And though the airlines are still reeling, burning through cash at a rate of tens of millions of dollars a day, business is now picking up. On May 15, airlines flew nearly 7,000 flights, and the number continues to rise.  Loading...  Don't see the graphic above? Click here. Southwest Airlines reported this week that after a torrent of customers canceling travel plans in March and April, new bookings have outpaced cancellations in May. Delta Air Lines, United Airlines and American Airlines also reported increases in customers booking flights and fewer cancellations as they're beginning to add some flights for the summer months after drastically scaling back their schedules. Third-party travel booking sites are seeing more people searching for and booking flights, too. Search demand for domestic flights on the the travel app Hopper dropped more than 60% in March and remained low through April and the first part of May. But in recent weeks, the number of travelers adding watches for trips they'd take within the next 30 days quadrupled from the April low. "Right now, demand levels are still significantly lower than they were at the beginning of the year and even over the past 10 years," Hopper chief economist Hayley Berg said. "But there are strong, positive signals." She said search traffic and a survey of travelers indicate many Americans, "especially from younger demographics, including millennials, [say] that they are interested in traveling this summer." Hopper's recent survey finds nearly 75% of respondents in the U.S. said they do plan to travel this year, but not until they feel comfortable. The survey also finds more than 40% of Americans said they plan to travel by air this summer, with 25% planning to book their travel in the next month.

             A rare sight at one of the world's busiest airports: empty gates at Chicago's O'Hare in late April. "The demand is there, and I think that customers, especially those in the U.S., are looking for signals to decide when it is safe for them and when they do feel comfortable to start traveling again" Berg said, "and the hope is that will be this summer." Nonetheless, the airline and travel industries are bracing for what is expected to be a long and slow recovery from the pandemic, and there are fears a resurgence of the virus in the fall could add more pain and misery to industries already suffering huge financial and job losses.

             A Hertz car rental logo is seen in Landover Hills, Maryland, December 31, 2014. Car rental company Hertz filed for bankruptcy protection Friday, citing an "abrupt decline in revenue" during the coronavirus pandemic. Hertz is just the latest high-profile company to feel the financial pain of the COVID-19 crisis: Retailers J.C. Penney, J. Crew, and Neiman Marcus all filed for bankruptcy protection this month. Home-decor chain Pier 1 Imports announced it would be closing for good, with final closing sales beginning Memorial Day weekend. After many states began to declare stay at home orders in March, car rentals dried up, and Hertz reduced spending, implemented furloughs and laid off 20,000 employees. In April the company, which includes car-rental brands Dollar, Thrifty and Firefly, missed a payment on its debt, but reached a short-term deal with its creditors. The company was unable to secure a long-term agreement. The filing excludes Hertz's international operating regions in Europe, Australia and New Zealand, as well as its more than 10,000 franchised locations. The company said it would use more than $1 billion in cash on hand to support its ongoing operations as it proceeds with the bankruptcy process. The company will continue to honor reservations, promotional offers, vouchers and rewards points programs. "Today's action will protect the value of our business, allow us to continue our operations and serve our customers, and provide the time to put in place a new, stronger financial foundation to move successfully through this pandemic and to better position us for the future," said CEO Paul Stone in a statement. "Our loyal customers have made us one of the world's most iconic brands, and we look forward to serving them now and on their future journeys." In addition to its financial woes, Hertz has been under management upheaval. Stone was named CEO on May 18 — days before the bankruptcy filing — after Kathryn Marinello stepped down. He previously served as executive vice president and chief retail operations officer for North America.J.Crew started as a mail-order catalog selling an imaginary version of New England privilege — think boat shoes, pastel shorts and weathered polo shirts. It grew into a blockbuster fashion house selling outfits to first ladies and fashionistas. And then, last month, after going public and then private again, it went bankrupt.

             A woman wearing a face mask and goggles walks through LAX airport in Los Angeles on Friday. Each week we answer pressing coronavirus questions. We'd like to hear what you're curious about. Email us at goatsandsoda@npr.org with the subject line: "Weekly Coronavirus Questions." How big a risk is it to catch the virus through your eyes? Should people be wearing eye protection? Virologist and epidemiologist Dr. Joseph Fair recently became ill, and he believes he got COVID-19 through his eyes. Fair told NBC's Today from his hospital bed last week that he had been on a crowded flight two weeks earlier, and though he wore a mask and gloves and wiped down his seat, he didn't have any protection over his eyes. "You can still get this virus through your eyes, and epidemiologically, it's the best guess I have of probably how I got it," Fair said. He said his symptoms started three or four days later, though his four tests for the virus were negative. The notion that you can get the virus through your eyes isn't new, but it has been little discussed compared with the risk of infection through the nose and mouth.  The CDC says that while the nose and mouth are the main avenues by which someone catches the coronavirus, "it may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes." "Based upon what we know, I would say that the possibility of acquiring it on the surface of your eye is possible. It's certainly plausible," says Dr. Thomas Steinemann, a spokesperson for the American Academy of Ophthalmology and professor of ophthalmology at MetroHealth Medical Center in Cleveland.  "Any sort of open mucosa [mucous membrane] is a chance for a droplet to land there and get into your body," says Dr. Abraar Karan, a physician at Harvard Medical School. But while it's known that the virus can be transmitted through the eyes, "it's hard to quantify exactly what the risk is in terms [of] through the eye specifically." For most cases, it's impossible to determine with certainty the initial avenue of someone's infection – that is, whether a person was infected via their mouth, nose or eyes. And the evidence so far suggests that eyes are not a primary mode of transmission.  If a lot of people were being infected through their eyes, there would be more COVID-19 patients with conjunctivitis – inflammation of the eyes, also known as pink eye. If the virus invades and infiltrates your conjunctiva – the clear tissue covering the white part of your eye and the inside of your eyelids – likely "there's going to be inflammation or redness in your eyes," Steinemann says. Of course there are many other causes for conjunctivitis, though, so getting pink eye doesn't necessarily mean you have COVID-19. So far, studies have found that among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, only a small percentage of those who had the fluid in their eyes swabbed for the virus did in fact test positive for the virus in their eyes.  It should be noted, though, that eye swabbing is not standard practice for COVID-19 patients – in part because most people don't have much eye fluid, so swabbing it is uncomfortable.  And there's another reason why eyes are not a likely way to be infected with the coronavirus: The pathway from your eyes into your respiratory system is less direct than via your nose and mouth. If an infectious person coughs or sneezes in your face, and you breathe in through your mouth or nose, not only are you going to receive a sizable viral dose, "you're going to get a fairly direct hit into your airways," Steinemann says. But to infect you via your eyes, the virus would have to penetrate your eyes' mucous membrane, be washed by tears behind your cheeks into your nasal cavity, and then flow from the nose into your throat. "It's a more circuitous route," says Steinemann.  Our eyes have a number of defense mechanisms that help protect against infection, like eyelids that blink to cover the eye and tears that contain immunoglobulins that fight invaders.  "You blink really easily any time even a puff of air goes near your eye," says Dr. Emily Landon, hospital epidemiologist and infectious diseases specialist at University of Chicago Medicine. "So if somebody coughs or sneezes near you, you're really likely to close off your eyes. That's good. Whereas your mouth and nose don't do that."

The basic precautions against the coronavirus still hold when it comes to your eyes, says Steinemann: Wash your hands, practice social distancing – and "don't touch your face" also means don't rub your eyes. With some airlines now asking flight attendants to wear safety goggles – Qatar Airlines is the latest to announce this plan — the general public might wonder: Should others do the same? Karan says that in health care settings, eye coverings are immensely important. "We definitely don't go into [coronavirus patients'] rooms without eye coverings." He says other jobs that require people to work face-to-face, like a barber, might also choose to wear a full-face clear plastic shield.  Steinemann also says whether you need eye protection depends on your job. If you work in an office where you don't have to be in close proximity to people to others, you should be fine without eye protection.  On the other hand, he says, "if you are in close proximity to somebody screaming at you or talking to you or coughing in your face, or if you work in a hospital, suctioning people who are in an intensive care unit — those types of situations are extremely high risk, not only to your nose and your mouth, but also to your eyes. In a high-risk situation, I would definitely recommend the use of a full-face shield and goggles."  You don't need to be wearing a face shield on your walk around the neighborhood or your visit to the grocery store, he notes. For those situations, he recommends wearing a mask and practicing good hygiene and social distancing. And what about the case of the virologist on the packed airplane?  Steinemann says if he was on a crowded airplane and unable to keep distance from other passengers, "Yeah, I think I might wear a face shield and a goggle in that setting."  Landon says that she has face shields at her home but has not yet found an activity where it felt necessary for her family to wear them. "But I am going to ask my mom to wear one when she takes a plane home from Florida – if I let her take the plane home from Florida."

             This Bornean horseshoe bat and other bat species can harbor coronaviruses. The nonprofit group EcoHealth Alliance had U.S. government funding for an ongoing research project in China on bats and coronaviruses — until the money was cut on April 24. In an open letter to a top Trump Administration official, 77 Nobel prize-winning American scientists say they are "gravely concerned" about the recent abrupt cancellation of a federal grant to a U.S. non-profit that was researching coronaviruses in China. The laureates say that the move, announced on April 24, "sets a dangerous precedent by interfering in the conduct of science" and "deprives the nation and the world of highly regarded science that could help control one of the greatest health crises in modern history and those that may arise in the future." The research group in question, EcoHealth Alliance, specializes in hunting viruses worldwide. For years their scientists have been trapping bats in China in order to check their blood and saliva for new coronaviruses that could spark the next pandemic in humans. Last year the National Institutes of Health renewed funding for that project – granting EcoHealth Alliance $4 million to cover the next five years of research. Then, last month, various U.S. officials began working to raise suspicions that a local Chinese lab that EcoHealth Alliance had partnered with – the Wuhan Institute of Virology—had accidentally released the virus causing COVID-19. (The Institute is located in the Chinese city where the current pandemic began.)  Multiple virologists who are familiar with lab accidents as well as the way that coronavirus research is conducted have discounted the accident theory as nearly impossible. Yet a few days after a White House press conference at which President Trump promised action on the issue – and erroneously implied that the entirety of the grant had gone to the Wuhan Institute — NIH terminated the funding. EcoHealth Alliance's president Peter Daszak has told NPR that as a result, his group hasn't just lost the ability to look for new viruses in China. They — and the many international researchers with whom they share their data – have also lost access to the vast collection of distinct coronavirus samples already collected. These include around 50 from a category that caused the 2002 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, and, now, the COVID-19 pandemic.  In an email informing EcoHealth of the grant termination, an NIH official said the reason was that the project did not align with NIH goals and priorities. In their letter Friday, the 77 Nobel laureates dismiss this as "preposterous." The writers – who are from the fields of medicine, chemistry and physics and represent honorees from nearly every year since 1975 — note that EcoHealth's grant application had received "a very high priority score" during peer review. And they add, "now is precisely the time when we need to support this kind of research if we aim to control the pandemic and prevent subsequent ones." The letter is addressed to not only the head of the NIH but to the Trump-appointed cabinet member who oversees the agency — Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar. The laureates conclude with a call for a "thorough review of the actions that led to the decision to terminate the grant" and "appropriate steps to rectify the injustices that may have been committed in revoking it."Washington state acknowledged this week that it has lost hundreds of millions of dollars to a sophisticated unemployment fraud ring. Most of the money had come from the federal government in the form of pandemic aid. It does not appear to have been a case of hacking, or a data breach. Rather, scammers used names and Social Security numbers they already had, possibly from earlier data breaches, to pose as out-of-work Washingtonians, security experts said. In many cases — likely most cases — the real Washingtonians had not actually lost their jobs. "At this point, we have tens of thousands of individuals whose stolen information has been used to file fraudulent claims," said Suzi LeVine, commissioner of the state's Employment Security Department. Officials wouldn't share details about how they were fooled by so many fake applications, but outside investigators are pointing to weaknesses in the state's unemployment benefits system.

             One of the unemployment claim notification letters sent to Washington state employers, which were often closed during the pandemic. Tens of thousands of claims are believed to be fraudulent. One vulnerability appears to have been the reliance on the mail during a pandemic lockdown. When the Employment Security Department gets an unemployment claim through its website, it sends a letter to the claimant's employer to confirm the job loss. The letter gives the employer about a week to object to the claim or correct the record. If there's no response from the employer, the benefits may be paid out. Many of those letters languished in piles of mail delivered to offices closed under emergency social distancing rules. When employers found the letters in their accumulated mail and tried to notify the state of the potential fraud, they encountered long wait times on the phone. Eventually, enough employer responses made it through to alert the department that something was amiss. "It started out as a trickle, but it really became more of a flood early the week of [May] 11," LeVine said. "It was at that moment where, you know, 'Break glass and pull the alarm.' " By that point, millions in fraudulent benefits had already gone out the door. The state may also have made it harder for law enforcement to trace the stolen money, by paying benefits to prepaid debit cards. Investigators with the email security firm Agari said they've observed a major overseas cybercrime gang targeting Washington and other states for this kind of large-scale imposter unemployment fraud. They said the scammers' first step was to set up accounts with a prepaid system called Green Dot to receive the unemployment benefits. Prepaid cards allow states to send benefits quickly to unemployed people who may not have traditional bank accounts. But Agari CEO Patrick Peterson said the accounts also make things much easier for scammers, especially those operating from overseas. "You can apply online," he said. "And then, of course, once you get the funds, it's purely electronic. There's no bank branch. There's not even a camera on an ATM. You can simply move the money around electronically." Washington's Employment Security Department would not confirm whether fraudulent claims had been paid to such cards, and Green Dot didn't respond to a request from NPR for comment. Late Thursday, the Justice Department released a statement saying that federal investigators were working to recover the stolen funds and that "a diligent financial institution, with which agents were working, was able to prevent $120 million from being distributed to criminals." The statement did not say what type of financial institution it was. In the meantime, the state said it is adding more security to its unemployment claims process. "We have and will continue to make changes to our system that will require some customers to verify or provide certain information," LeVine said Thursday. She wouldn't give details, saying she didn't want to give scammers insights into the system.  But she lamented that the changes could add a day or two to the claims process. "This makes me the most angry," she said. "That we need to delay payments to Washingtonians who need these benefits."

             The Inglewood Army recruiting station is tucked into a strip mall in a gritty part of Los Angeles. Its neighbors are a liquor store, fast food outlets and palm trees. Inside are the familiar posters: smiling soldiers with the slogans "Army Strong" and "Army Team." Sergeant First Class Nathan Anslow runs this station. He points to something new just inside the door. A stack of questionnaires — coronavirus screening forms. It's the first stop for potential recruits. "I go over the screening questions," he said. "Do they have any of the symptoms? Have they felt any of this? Have they  travelled? Are they currently sick or been around someone who's sick?" On the table are Clorox wipes and a bottle of hand sanitizer. Another table holds boxes of protective gear.  "So if they come to the office and don't have masks and gloves, I have some to provide for them," he said. Every recruiter here already is wearing a mask. Anslow sports a white one. Others have black masks,  an LA Dodgers mask. And, of course, a few camouflage masks to match their uniforms. This store front office normally would hold 11 recruiters. But in the age of distancing, Anslow has chopped down that number. Now just  three recruiters at a time are in the office, and only three recruits — who come in just to sign the final paperwork. And the all-important parents? "So if the parents want to sit down and go over things, I set up a separate appointment," Anslow said. "Because we don't want a bunch of people in here at the same time because it puts everybody at risk." Recruiters are somewhat stuck during this pandemic. They can't go out like they used to, trawling for recruits at schools and malls, or visiting their homes.  And few people can come in to the recruiting station.  That's why recruiters are going online. They're on Facebook and Twitter, Instagram and chat rooms. The Army was already moving in that direction. The age of the TV ad — remember "Be All That You Can Be"? —  is fading as most young people are staring at hand-held screens. "A lot of my future soldiers come from social media ... seeing my story and then reaching out to me," said Staff Sergeant Daniel Coello, one of the recruiters here. He's 27 and a Cuban immigrant who enlisted and then served in Iraq.  
                In this age of the coronavirus, wipes and hand sanitizer are front and center at the Inglewood recruiting station.

             The virus is on the minds of both recruits and parents, he said. Some recruits want to sign up because COVID-19 is all but ending any job prospects. Military recruiters have often said over the years the best thing for recruiting is a recession. And the parents? There is still the common concern about their child becoming a casualty on a far-off battlefield. Add to that the fear of being infected with the virus. "Mainly it's the parents and the family members that are concerned for them. Because they don't want them to leave home, so that they're not exposed," he said. Still, Sergeant Coello has been able to allay parents' concerns. His goal for the year is 36 recruits. He's already signed up 32. The annual goal for the office is 100. But it's a small slice of an Army hoping to attract some 69,000 new soldiers by the fall.  The Army is intent on making sure those future soldiers stay healthy. Before shipping out to basic training, recruits must quarantine for two weeks, wear masks and socially distance.  Even with those defensive measures, the coronavirus ambushed a local  recruit recently, just as he arrived at the training base. "That's when they tested and found out this individual was positive," said Command Sergeant Major Jason Provens. "Could that have been picked up in transport? Yes. Could that have been picked up  at the airport? Yes. Could that have been at the station? That's why we have to back up all the contact and assume the worst."  As a result of that positive test, a recruiting station in nearby Long Beach had to close and sanitize. And a recruiter is now quarantined for two weeks.  Army officials are quick to point out the recruit was tested and isolated before he could infect others at basic training. "You know the really good news is once we get to basic training we have a test," said Sergeant Major of the Army Michael Grinston, who's visiting this recruiting station with the top Army officer, General Jim McConville.  All recruits must be tested and quarantined for two weeks — even if the test is negative. Then the soldier is tested a second time before being allowed to train.  "We're going to know right off the bat and no matter where you are, we have our hospitals and every training location has its own tests," he said.  For his part, Gen. McConnville hopes all this will prevent another cluster of cases. That happened back in March when the South Carolina training base Fort Jackson was hit with COVID-19 and some 50 recruits fell ill. "We're pretty comfortable with the procedures we have in place," the general said. "But we respect the virus. We don't want to get over confident and think we have it all figured out. We don't." So the virus-free recruits will wear masks while they train and will also social distance. McConville points out the Army has always promoted that kind of distancing, or what it calls "tactical dispersal," because you don't want to bunch up and provide an enemy force with an easy target. And those recruits will also have a new piece of gear: a pocket-sized bottle of hand sanitizer. McConville holds one up. "They gave me that at Fort Jackson," he said. "It's Army-issued Purell. It's right there in the green bottle." The plastic bottle comes complete with indentations for an easy grip. "Only the Army," he said, "could figure out, you know, how to have, like, a hand hold." He stuffs his tactical Purell into his cargo pants and heads out through the masked recruiters.
                The increase in cases comes after companies such as Kroger ended extra "hero pay" for their workers.

             The increase in cases comes after companies such as Kroger ended extra "hero pay" for their workers. New data released by the United Food and Commercial Workers Union shows that among the grocery store workers it represents, 10,000 have been infected by or are known to have been exposed to coronavirus and 68 have died from it. At least 3,257 have been infected with the virus, the union estimated on Friday. UFCW represents workers in large grocery store chains like Kroger, Albertson's, and Supervalu. Union President Marc Perrone said in a news conference on Wednesday that the cases have increased by 200% in five weeks. This comes at a time when companies such as Kroger ended the extra 'hero pay' it had been giving its workers.  "The so-called 'hero,' and hazard pay should continue until this threat has actually passed," Perrone said. "If companies truly believe that this threat has passed, they should be willing to say that publicly on the record." The UFCW had numerous employees from Kroger, which is the largest grocery store chain in America, attend the press conference. Kroger recently announced a plan to give its employees "Thank You Pay" of $400 for qualified full-time workers and $200 for part-time employees. The special pay adds up $130 million company-wide. Kris Holtham, who works as a meat manager for Kroger in Lansing, Mich., and has been employed by the company for 35 years, says that getting customers to wear masks has become difficult. "Masks have become a political war," Holtham said. "The employees are downright scared and afraid to ask someone to put on a mask. ... I see hundreds of people a day without a mask. We are sitting ducks for the virus." Holtham recounted a story where she asked a customer to put on a mask for the sake of the workers and the customer responded with, "I don't give a damn about your health." Raquel Salorio has worked for the Southern California grocery chain Ralph's for 36 years and has a total of five people in her household working there. She decried the store's marketing of its employees being "heroes" as disingenuous.  Salorio recounted a particular day where the company asked its workers to dress up as superheroes. "We're not heroes," Salorio said. "People are suffering, people are dying, and they want us to dress up as superheroes. Our jobs matter, but our health matters more." NPR contacted representatives from Albertson's, Supervalu, and Kroger to comment on the figures presented by the UFCW. A spokesperson from Albertson's said that the company would not release employee coronavirus numbers but that the company "appreciate[s] the UFCW's work on behalf of its membership to help everyone stay safe during this difficult time." Kroger and Supervalu have not responded.

Earlier this week, an experimental coronavirus vaccine showed promise. But, for the moment, the full data from that research hasn't been released. Friday morning, Dr. Anthony Fauci told NPR he's seen the data and it looks "quite promising." According to Fauci, barring any setbacks, the US is on track to have a vaccine by early next year. Millions of Americans are turning to food banks to help feed their families during the pandemic. A new federal program pays farmers who've lost restaurant and school business to  donate the excess to community organizations. But even the people in charge of these organizations say direct cash assistance is a better way to feed Americans in need.A few months ago, before the lock downs, nearly 3,000 paratroopers of the 82nd Airborne Division left on a short-notice deployment to the Middle East.

             South Korean soldiers wearing protective masks sit at a temperature screening point at Incheon International Airport, South Korea, on March 9. South Korea's Center for Disease Control has reassuring news about people with COVID-19 who test positive for the coronavirus weeks after their symptoms have resolved. Health officials there studied 285 patients who tested negative for the virus after recovering, but weeks later tested positive again. The question — in this and similar situations — is whether a positive test in this circumstance means that these people can still spread the virus. To find out, the scientists followed up with nearly 800 of those people's personal contacts, such as family members. They found no evidence that they had contracted the virus from the people who had a fresh positive result. The scientists also tried to grow the virus in secretions from these patients. They could not. As a result of these findings, published online Tuesday, the South Korean CDC no longer recommends that people in this situation be isolated. Their contacts do not need to be quarantined, though health officials do plan to continue investigating cases of people who have tested positive again after having had a negative test. The study is shedding some light on the natural course of COVID-19. It's providing hints, but not definitive information, about how to handle patients who continue to test positive for the coronavirus long after their symptoms have resolved. The persistence of the virus in some people "seems to be a normal thing that happens," says Dr. Aaron Hess, an anesthesiologist at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health.  He and his colleagues encountered this conundrum as well. They were testing patients who had recovered from a bout of COVID-19 and had offered to donate blood plasma to use as part of an experimental treatment. The researchers tested a group of patients at least two weeks after they had recovered, just to make sure they weren't still producing virus. Eleven patients, representing 13% of their sample, still tested positive, "and this was a little surprising," he said. The test, known as PCR (for polymerase chain reaction), looks for genetic material from the virus. Both in the case of the Wisconsin study and that from South Korea, the level of genetic material from the virus in the sample was very low, Hess notes. That's consistent with the idea that it's simply biological residue, not signs of an active viral infection. "Having a positive PCR test after you've recovered in no way implies that you're infectious," Hess says. But it's still not clear when a positive result is worry-free. It's also not clear whether health officials in the United States will change their procedures based on the results from South Korea. "Unfortunately, what we don't have here in the U.S. is the kind of widespread testing and systematic contact tracing that might make you more confident in saying that you would be comfortable not re-isolating people who are positive," Hess says. Scientists are trying to gather enough data about this to have more definitive answers about when it's safe for a recovered patient to go back to work or to return to a nursing home, even if the PCR test shows signs of the coronavirus. "I think it's situations like this that are going to teach us a lot about all of the possibilities that surround the clinical infection of COVID-19," says Dr. Brian Conway, medical director of the Vancouver (Canada) Infectious Diseases Center. Conway has been studying a related mystery. He has a patient who apparently recovered, only to fall ill again — not just once, but twice. After her initial bout with COVID-19, she was well for 10 days "and then developed very significant symptoms for another week," Conway says. She recovered again, but 10 days later she got the same symptoms. Again, she recovered, "and then finally has been better over the past week or 10 days." The woman lives with four other people who were sick with COVID-19. "An interesting possibility that needs to be considered is that she passed the infection on to them. They became sick. She became well, then they passed the infection back to her," he says. Conway is trying to figure out whether she actually caught the disease three times or whether she's had one continuous but highly variable infection. He is planning to test blood samples from her taken during the course of the disease to see what he can learn. The case is apparently rare. There are only a few reported in the scientific literature, including one from Italy and a report from China. So most people who have recovered from COVID-19 shouldn't fret. But unusual cases often shed light on the biology of a disease. One pressing question is whether COVID-19 will end up being more like coronaviruses that can cause colds. For that disease, immunity fades quickly and reinfection can follow. Alternatively, it could be more like the measles, which usually causes a single bout of disease followed by a lifetime of immunity. There may also be clues that apply to vaccine development, Conway suggests. "There may be different kinds of antibodies that provide different kinds of protection," he says. That could be valuable information for vaccine developers. Conway says as of now, his patient and her family are all better. "Let's see what we can learn from this, to help us understand not only how the virus behaves, but how to counsel similar family units going forward."

             Dr. Jonas Salk, the scientist who created the polio vaccine, administers an injection to an unidentified boy at Arsenal Elementary School in Pittsburgh, Pa., in 1954. COVID-19 isn't the first health crisis the United States has faced that experts say a vaccine will be needed to resolve: In the 1950s, people lived in fear their children might be stricken with infantile paralysis, better known as polio — and they were eager for scientists to find a solution. "There was a lot of anxiety," says New York University medical historian David Oshinsky, author of Polio, An American Story. The polio experience differed from today's COVID-19 in one important respect: by the 1950s, polio — a disabling and potentially deadly disease -- was a familiar threat. Even former President Franklin D. Roosevelt had been stricken with the disease.  "It has been around for quite a while," Oshinsky says. "Certainly by the end of World War II, it had become a summer plague just sort of hitting the United States again and again and again at the same time of year." Then, as now, there was no effective treatment for polio, so a vaccine seemed the only way out. But even so, Oshinsky says the government played very little role in coming up with a vaccine for polio. "There was no federal research being done at this time," he says. "[The National Institutes of Health] was this teeny little organization, so it was basically up to a private charity to deal with this." That charity was the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, today known as the March of Dimes. Competing candidates There were several teams working on a vaccine...but the Foundation focused on two. One was a more traditional vaccine, being developed by a well-regarded virologist named Albert Sabin. The Sabin vaccine consisted of a weakened form of the polio virus that stimulated an immune response, but did not cause the disease.  The other was a less studied approach using a virus killed with formaldehyde and then packaged into a vaccine. Despite many naysayers, the inventor of this approach was convinced it would work. His name was Jonas Salk. Both camps received a lot of money from the Foundation, says Oshinsky, "but it was clear that the Salk camp could produce a quicker vaccine." In the spring of 1954, a massive study of the Salk vaccine kicked off. At the time, confidence in the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis was high, as was fear of the polio virus, and millions of children took part in the trial. "I don't know if we could even do the Salk polio vaccine trial today because I don't know if there's an organization that has the same level of trust," says Marcia Meldrum, a social scientist at UCLA.  Salk didn't think there needed to be a control group that received a placebo vaccine because "he believe that his vaccine worked," says Oshinsky. But Thomas Francis, a well-known virologist tasked with overseeing the trial, insisted that one was necessary to verify the results.  The announcement of results came the following year. "Safe, effective, and potent," is how Francis characterized the vaccine on April 12, 1955. "The Public Health Service immediately licensed five different pharmaceutical firms to produce it," says Meldrum. But there was a problem. "One of them did not do a good job," she says. Vaccine problems Mysteriously, some children developed symptoms of polio after receiving the vaccine.  It turned out that the vaccine made by Cutter Laboratories was responsible. The company's manufacturing process did not fully kill the virus they used to make their vaccine. As a result, hundreds of children who got the Cutter vaccine got polio, and some died.  The debacle with the Cutter laboratories shattered public trust and the government suspended all vaccinations while it investigated.  Ultimately the vaccines manufactured by other companies were declared safe, and people started getting vaccinated again.  Oshinsky, the historian, says despite the setback, the story of the Salk vaccine is one of the great success stories of American medical research, and there are lessons for the COVID-19 vaccine effort. "We want a vaccine as quickly as possible," he says. "But in the end, Cutter [vaccine experience] also tells you've got to be cautious. You can't do it too quickly."

             The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has published planning scenarios to help public health officials address the coronavirus. Some experts consider these estimates optimistic. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention this week revised downward its estimates for future infections and deaths from the coronavirus, painting a picture of the pandemic that some scientists say is overly optimistic — and that plays into fears the agency could be responding to political pressure. The nation's top public health authority this week posted scientific parameters that show its earlier view of the pandemic — considered too optimistic by some experts — has improved even more, although it still predicts hundreds of thousands of deaths if measures such as social distancing and the wearing of masks to prevent the virus's spread are abandoned. The CDC expects hospitals to see millions fewer COVID-19 patients than the agency expected in mid-April, according to a comparison between a new modeling document and earlier, internal versions obtained by the Center for Public Integrity in April. The agency, part of the Department of Health and Human Services, also expects roughly 100,000 fewer deaths over the course of the pandemic. The CDC's current "best guess" is that — in a scenario without any further social distancing or other efforts to control the spread of the virus — roughly 4 million patients would be hospitalized in the U.S. with COVID-19 and 500,000 would die over the course of the pandemic. That's according to the agency's new parameters that the Center for Public Integrity plugged into a simple epidemiological model."The planning scenarios are being used by mathematical modelers throughout the federal government," the CDC document said. They "may also be useful to hospital administrators in assessing resource needs."More than 95,000 people have died in the U.S. from COVID-19 as of Friday, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.The CDC and White House did not respond to requests for comment.Glass half fullThe new CDC guide for modeling deaths and hospitalizations underscores how politicians, government officials and medical experts still disagree on how deadly the coronavirus is and how much caution to take when reopening the nation's economy.Four out of seven experts consulted earlier by the Center for Public Integrity found the CDC's death rate estimates from April too low. The revised figures remain too optimistic, Harvard epidemiologist William Hanage said. "If you're taking these numbers to be your guide, they're obviously lowball estimates," he said. The fatality rates in the document "are certainly at the very low end" of those that scientists think possible, agreed Joseph Lewnard, an epidemiologist at the University of California, Berkeley. "Greater clarity on the scientific basis for these estimates is urgently needed." The CDC document outlines five possible scenarios for the future of the pandemic, one "best guess" and two better-case and two worse-case versions. All of them are "unmitigated," meaning they do not account for future social distancing, widespread mask usage or other efforts to contain the coronavirus. Social distancing practices among U.S. states vary wildly: Dozens of states have now lifted their stay-at-home orders; seven never issued them, and 15 still mandate that residents stay home when possible, according to the nonpartisan political reference site Ballotpedia. State and local officials can use the scenarios as a baseline model against which to weigh different responses. "Modeling is done in order to explore the consequences of things you'd rather not find out the hard way," Hanage said. "All the models are only going to be as good as their assumptions." Another expert, University of Washington biologist Carl Bergstrom, said that even the CDC's worst-case scenario is realistically a best-case scenario. The agency's worst-case fatality rate, he noted, is more optimistic than recent, high-quality coronavirus data about the death rate in Spain. "These [CDC] numbers are so far outside of the scientific consensus that this strikes me as a devious and cynical effort to manipulate not only federal modeling but the broader scientific discourse," Bergstrom wrote on Twitter. The CDC's latest fatality rates are in line with one set of estimates: those that John Ioannidis, a Stanford University professor of medicine, published in a not-yet-peer-reviewed analysis of antibody studies worldwide. Ioannidis has championed a less cautious response to the coronavirus, earning kudos from those who favor swift reopenings, such as Fox News anchor Laura Ingraham, and criticism from many public health experts. He did not respond to a request for comment. What would fewer hospitalizations mean?The CDC's new, lower estimates would still suggest far more hospitalizations and deaths than seasonal flu's annual tolls. But they are lower than figures used by other influential models. The fatality rate, for instance, falls below a wide range of possible rates used by Imperial College London in its model for all 50 states.The nation's health care system could perhaps handle the CDC-predicted 4 million hospital stays over the months-long course of an unmitigated pandemic, said Irwin Redlener, director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University. But he doubts Americans would want to see the corresponding 500,000 estimated deaths from such an approach — essentially aiming for herd immunity. That would far exceed the number of American soldiers who died in World War II, by comparison.  "That is not a planning scenario that is appropriate, I think, for a developed democracy," Redlener said. "We need to be able to do better than that." The coronavirus will not spread evenly across the country. Like all fast-moving infectious diseases, it may rage in some areas while leaving others relatively untouched. Experts said people must not only look at the overall picture of the pandemic's danger, but about the chances for sudden, local surges that overwhelm hospitals. "Think of New York," Hanage said. "Think of those places that have been really badly hit."An earlier model produced by the Harvard Global Health Institute in March, before many states issued stay-at-home orders, used a far higher hospitalization rate than the CDC's current number and predicted that many communities would run out of hospital beds without social distancing. The United States has more than 900,000 hospital beds, according to the American Hospital Association, though at any given moment, many of them are already used by patients with typical ailments unrelated to COVID-19. The CDC doubled its fatality-rate estimates for the coronavirus from early April to mid-April, with the resulting death estimates jumping from roughly 300,000 to 600,000 over the course of the pandemic, before adjusting them downward in the current document. The hospitalization rate also went up in mid-April but now sits below either of the April figures. It is unclear whether the CDC's new parameters, which the agency said come from data it received before April 29, are based on test data that improperly mixed both antibody and viral results, as The Atlantic reported Thursday.That mistake has raised suspicions among health experts that political considerations are marring the CDC's data since mixing the two types of tests made the nation's viral testing capacity look better than it is and confused the scientific picture of the virus."It's incomprehensible that the CDC's scientists would make such a rookie mistake that muddies their own data — unless politics is interfering with their ability to do their job," the Harvard Global Health Institute said in a newsletter Thursday.Parameter revisions are normal when modeling epidemics. Scientists expect to revise the numbers they use to describe the power and reach of a virus as they learn more about it. The CDC document reflects this: "The parameter values will change as more data become available," it said.Several news outlets have reported that White House officials have privately questioned whether the official death count for the coronavirus is inflated, while experts said data on excess deaths showed the COVID-19 fatality count was likely incomplete.The new CDC document weighs in on that question. The pandemic is likely worse than official numbers show, the agency suggested."Many cases and deaths are never confirmed to be COVID-19," the document said.Every U.S. state implemented restrictions designed to limit the spread of COVID-19. Businesses reduced or ceased operations, people transitioned into working and learning remotely, and nonessential activities were paused. At least temporarily, much of the country was under strict orders to stay home.  But as of May 20, all 50 states have begun the process of easing restrictions on businesses, though public health experts say that some are doing so too quickly. At a May 12 Senate hearing, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the U.S.'s top infectious disease expert, expressed concern about some states and localities skipping federal guidelines to open prematurely.

Governors are outlining new frameworks and timelines for their states as they ramp up testing and contact tracing efforts. Some have also formed regional partnerships to coordinate economic recovery. Most are releasing general and sector-specific reopening guidelines for industries and individuals.   Each day brings changes. NPR is tracking developments in all 50 states, Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia so you can see what's changed and how states compare.

Most states still encourage at-risk populations to continue avoiding nonessential outings.  Governors in states such as New York, California, Washington, Pennsylvania and Maine have enacted plans that allow regions that meet certain criteria to progress through reopening phases at a faster pace than the rest of the state. Other states, such as Virginia, New Mexico and Utah, have delayed reopening timelines for particular counties based on public health metrics. And within many states, local governments may be authorized to implement tighter or looser restrictions in their own jurisdictions.  Once they reopen, most establishments must follow specific protocols, including limiting building occupancy and requiring employees to wear face masks. Hair salons, barber shops and other personal care services that are allowed to reopen must often comply with new safety protocols, such as only taking customers by appointment and spacing out work stations.  Restaurants are increasingly allowed to open for limited in-house dining, in addition to offering delivery, takeout and curbside pickup. Many states limit dining to outdoor areas before later permitting restaurants to open indoor seating.    The first version of this page was originally published on March 12.

             Flanked by President Trump, Dr. Anthony Fauci speaks during a coronavirus task force briefing last month at the White House. Dr. Anthony Fauci expressed "cautious optimism" Friday about the initial results from a coronavirus vaccine trial — which were widely celebrated this week — and said it remains "conceivable" that a vaccine for the deadly pathogen could be available by the end of the year. Amid a global race for a vaccine, the nation's leading infectious disease expert said in an interview with NPR that he was encouraged by findings from the phase one trial of a vaccine under development by researchers at the Massachusetts-based biotech company Moderna Inc. On Monday, the company said the vaccine appears both safe and capable of stimulating in test subjects the type of immune response needed to ward off an infection. But the company, which is developing the vaccine in collaboration with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which Fauci leads, has yet to publish detailed results from the trial, fueling concerns among researchers about how much the announcement can be trusted. Addressing those concerns, Fauci said his team at the infectious disease institute is compiling full details from the trial but said, "Having looked at the data myself, it is really quite promising." "The vaccine induced what we call neutralizing antibodies, as opposed to just binding antibodies, and neutralizing antibodies are antibodies that actually can block the virus," Fauci said. The results were "even better than we thought," he said, "and they did it at a moderate dose of the vaccine." Fauci said full results would be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal, most likely within a few weeks. If all goes according to plan, Fauci said it is possible that a vaccine could be available within a matter of months — a timeline that would shatter the years-long process typically required to produce a vaccine. "I think it is conceivable if we don't run into things that are, as they say, unanticipated setbacks, that we could have a vaccine that we could be beginning to deploy at the end of this calendar year, December 2020 or into January 2021," Fauci said. But "that's never a promise," he cautioned, "because when you're dealing with vaccines, there could be so many things that get in the way." Moderna's vaccine is just one of hundreds under development by companies and universities worldwide racing to stamp out a virus that in the United States alone has infected more than 1.5 million people and claimed the lives of nearly 95,000. With all 50 states in the beginning stages of reopening their economies after weeks of lockdown, the search for a vaccine is taking on new urgency. Any vaccine will be met by massive global demand requiring billions of doses and a total shift in approach to how vaccines are typically developed. Fauci said that has meant moving forward with production before testing can be completed. He explained that accelerating efforts to develop the coronavirus vaccine in this way is "not compromising in any way the safety or the scientific integrity." "What we're doing right now, and this is something that I think is going to be characteristic of multiple of the candidates that are being tested for a coronavirus vaccine, is that you even start investing and even making doses of the vaccine before you are completely sure that it works. So the risk is not to the patients, because the safety and the scientific integrity is intact," he said. "The risk is to the investment." Until a vaccine is ready, public health experts agree that social distancing and other mitigation measures will remain central to keeping the outbreak at bay, particularly as states begin to reopen. Fauci has warned of a second wave of cases, and said Friday that "the one thing I'm sure of is that there will be infections around in the fall and in the winter, because it's not going to disappear from the planet." Fauci said the test for government leaders will be how well-prepared they are to keep "blips of cases" from growing into outbreaks, and from there "real rebounds of infection." Doing so will require "identification, isolation and contact tracing," he said. "It isn't inevitable that we're going to have a massive rebound," Fauci said. "What is inevitable is that we will see cases. It's how we deal with it that's going to be the endgame." Fauci was also asked about an analysis researchers at Columbia University released this week that found approximately 36,000 deaths could have been avoided in the United States had broad social distancing measures been put in place one week earlier in March. The U.S. could have also seen roughly 700,000 fewer infections if actions that began March 15 had instead started March 8, according to the study. "We always could have done better, particularly when you look in the rearview mirror and do a retrospectoscope and say, 'Wow, you know, we could have saved a lot of disease if we had done it much earlier.' And that's true," Fauci said. "You have to have a certain degree of realism and humility about it."

             Chinese President Xi Jinping with Queen Elizabeth II during a state banquet at Buckingham Palace during Xi's state visit to Britain in October 2015. During Xi's visit, the queen hailed a new "golden era" in relations between the two countries. In 2015, Queen Elizabeth accompanied Chinese President Xi Jinping in a gilded, horse-drawn carriage to Buckingham Palace, during a visit that was supposed to symbolize "a new golden era" of closer economic ties between this former empire and the ascendant power in the east. "The relationship between China and the United Kingdom is now truly a global partnership," the queen declared during a state banquet. Five years later, the tone and attitude in London are totally different. Political analysts say the growing assertiveness of the Chinese government and its recent coronavirus disinformation campaign have soured relations and encouraged lawmakers and members of the British government to reconsider its China policy. "I think the Chinese have shown a remarkable ability to shoot themselves in the feet," says Raffaello Pantucci, a senior associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute for Defense and Security Studies in London. Britain's top diplomat, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, says there are tough conversations ahead between the two countries.

             China's ambassador to Britain Liu Xiaoming arrives at the Chinese Embassy in London in February for a press conference on the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan. "There's no doubt, we can't have business as usual after this crisis," Raab said at a press briefing last month. "We'll have to ask the hard questions about how it came about and how it could have been stopped earlier." Raab was referring to calls by officials in the United Kingdom and other liberal democracies including Sweden, Australia and the United States, for an investigation into the origins and initial handling of the virus. Political analysts say relations between the U.K. and China had already been declining in recent years. In 2017, students at Durham University went public when a Chinese embassy official reportedly threatened them to drop a human rights activist from a public debate on China. British lawmaker Tom Tugendhat says that same year, Liu Xiaoming, Beijing's ambassador to the U.K., tried to dictate terms of a parliamentary trip to China. "He attempted to tell us who we could and couldn't take on the visit," recalled Tugendhat, who chairs Parliament's foreign affairs committee. "The bullying by the Chinese ambassador to London actually rather revealed the nature of the regime." Relations worsened this year, after it emerged that officials in Wuhan tried to cover up discovery of the coronavirus. Beijing's initial handling of the crisis "sowed doubt in people's minds about how reliable China is as a partner," says Rana Mitter, director of the University of Oxford China Center and the author of a forthcoming book, China's Good War: How World War II is Shaping a New Nationalism. Charges and counter-charges followed. In February, Arkansas Republican Sen. Tom Cotton suggested — without evidence — the virus had come from a Wuhan lab, which China denied. The next month, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, Zhao Lijian, suggested — also without evidence — that the American military had brought the virus to China. "We're seeing, effectively, a concerted attempt to use propaganda to change the narrative," Tugendhat said. China insists it has been transparent and critics are smearing it. During a recent video session with London's Asia House, Ambassador Liu likened the criticism and even lawsuits against China to the tactics of past imperialists, apparently alluding to the 19th century Opium Wars, when Britain forced China to cede territory and open itself to trade with the West. The Chinese Communist Party describes what followed as a "century of humiliation." "Some people want to play world police," Liu said. "This is not the era of gunboat diplomacy... These people think they live in the old days. They think they can bully China." The Chinese Embassy in London did not respond to NPR's request for comment. Under global pressure, Beijing says it will support a World Health Organization investigation into the virus' origins, but only after the pandemic has been brought under control. For decades, Chinese diplomats around the world generally maintained a low profile, following the philosophy of the late leader Deng Xiaoping, who urged "hide your strength, bide your time." But under Xi, so-called "Wolf Warrior" diplomats have emerged, named for patriotic action films about a Chinese special forces operative who dispatches foreign mercenaries and arms dealers, Rambo-style. Among those seen as Wolf Warriors is Gui Congyou, China's ambassador to Sweden. After a former Hong Kong bookseller, who is imprisoned in China, was honored with a human rights award in Sweden last year, Gui told Swedish public radio: "We treat our friends with fine wine, but for our enemies we have shotguns." Most analysts say the aggressive tone is primarily aimed at a Chinese domestic audience, to stoke national pride and show that Beijing is willing to attack critics and defend the country's honor. Charlie Parton, a retired British diplomat, calls the Wolf Warriors "national treasures" — not for China, but for Britain and other liberal democracies. "They are wonderful representations of how nasty the party really can be, stripped of all this 'win, win' and 'in a shared destiny of mankind' rhetoric," said Parton, referring to two of the Chinese government's favorite slogans about the country's relationship with the rest of the world. As the Chinese government continues to assert itself, some British lawmakers say the U.K. needs a new, more sophisticated and nuanced approach. For starters, Tugendhat says, Britain must eventually eject Huawei, the Chinese telecom giant, from the U.K.'s 5G system. Parton, who has spent more than two decades either working in China or covering the country, agrees, arguing that continuing to allow a Chinese company access to critical infrastructure is too risky and could make Britain beholden to the Chinese government. "Can we make decisions in other areas unrelated to 5G and telecommunications in which China looms large?" Parton said. "And we think, 'Well, actually, we've got to be careful because ultimately they could cause us real problems.'" Parton says British politicians need to tone down the rhetoric, as the U.K. still needs China for medical supplies, among other things. But he believes Britain's reliance on China's economy – China was the U.K.'s sixth-largest export market and fourth largest source of imports in 2018 – is overblown. Any moves to change the U.K.'s relationship with the world's second-largest economy, though, will have to be weighed against the economic damage caused by the pandemic and Britain's relative isolation coming out of Brexit. "We're certainly not a position to go into any kind of Cold War, but we have to nonetheless engage with [China] on our own terms," says Mitter. "It's really hard, but nobody said that geopolitics was easy."

             The original military courtroom at the U.S. Navy base at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, is seen in this photo approved for release by the U.S. military. The coronavirus has not spared the U.S. military court and prison at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, where legal proceedings have come to a virtual standstill due to the pandemic. That has critics of Guantánamo, which has cost taxpayers more than $6 billion despite finalizing only one conviction in nearly two decades, saying this is a chance to shut it down for good. Guantánamo has had at least two cases of COVID-19: one in a sailor at the U.S. naval base on the island and a second in the guard force that oversees its prisoners, which include Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, alleged mastermind of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorism attacks. The U.S. Department of Defense said that for security reasons it will not say whether there have been additional positive diagnoses at Guantánamo, but because of the pandemic all court hearings have been canceled since mid-March and are not scheduled to restart until late July. In addition, the facility is subject to health safety measures such as social distancing and the mandatory wearing of masks and gloves when near prisoners. There is also a 14-day quarantine for anyone arriving on the island, which has basically halted court travel because Guantánamo lawyers must also quarantine for 14 days upon returning to the U.S., turning even a short trip into a monthlong commitment. Even before the pandemic, problem-plagued Guantánamo had been hit with more dysfunction than usual, including the departures of several key personnel. Among them were the judge in the Sept. 11 case, Air Force Col. W. Shane Cohen, who left in April after announcing he was taking early retirement after less than a year on the job, and the head of the military court, Christian Reismeier, who moved to a different court role after being in his position for less than a year. Two of the lead attorneys for the Sept. 11 defendants have also stepped aside in recent months. All of that leaves the Sept. 11 case trial, scheduled to begin jury selection next January, in limbo. "It's definitely not going to come off as a January 2021 trial — that's perfectly clear," said Bobby Chesney, a law professor at the University of Texas at Austin who specializes in national security law and has followed Guantánamo closely since it opened in 2002. "There's just no telling when this might get underway," he added. "But we certainly know this — that as long as COVID-19 is raging and these detainees are located in Guantánamo, there are going to be basic practical difficulties getting a single thing done." To Georgetown Law School professor Abbe Smith, who traveled to Guantánamo in January to watch hearings in the case against Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, accused of orchestrating the USS Cole naval warship bombing, the recent upheaval calls for a radical reset at the court. "You have to try these men or release them. Try them or release them," said Smith, who argues that indefinitely holding Guantánamo's 40 remaining prisoners, most of whom have never been charged with a crime, is illegal and immoral. "And, yes, I understand the anger and I understand the grief of those who have lost people or who have people who were terribly injured as a result of these acts of terrorism," added Smith, who after returning from her trip wrote a piece for the National Law Journal titled "It's Time to Rethink Guantánamo Bay Military Commissions." "But it's unbelievable what we're paying to maintain this system that hasn't accomplished anything," she said. "I mean, especially post-COVID, imagine what we could do with that money," a reference to Guantánamo's $6 billion cost since opening. New York City resident Colleen Kelly, whose brother died in the World Trade Center attacks on Sept. 11, has made more than a dozen trips to Guantánamo to watch court proceedings. She, too, said the shutdown caused by the pandemic and the recent personnel departures present an ideal moment to question business as usual at the military court. "My basic thought is that this is kind of the perfect time to change everything about Guantánamo," Kelly said. "The time for plowing ahead really is over. This is never-ending, so why not really shake things up?" Kelly advocates removing the Guantánamo cases from military court and instead trying them in U.S. federal court, which has extensive experience handling terrorism cases, or negotiating guilty pleas with the prisoners. However, the U.S. government has given no indication that it is inclined to change the status quo at Guantánamo. In a statement emailed to NPR, a Defense Department spokeswoman said the military is trained to do rotations and will continue rotating personnel in and out of Guantánamo. She also said Guantánamo's cases have no fixed timeline. Still, said Kelly, "I feel like the 9/11 trial is mired as deeply as the war in Afghanistan and the never-ending wars in the Middle East, so why not take a fresh look?"The coronavirus test wasn't as bad as Celeste Torres imagined. Standing outside a dorm at the University of California, San Diego, Torres stuck a swab up a nostril, scanned a QR code, and went on with the day. "The process itself was about five minutes," Torres says, "I did cry a little bit just because it's, I guess, a natural reaction." Torres hadn't been exhibiting symptoms, and didn't end up testing positive. Rather, they are a data point, part of a mass testing effort at UC San Diego to make sure an in-person fall semester is possible. "We're not trying to test to see if we can detect an outbreak right now," explains Dr. Robert Schooley, a virologist and professor of medicine, who is helping lead the project. "We're trying to make sure that we can scale to be able to do that in the fall." Getting colleges and universities going is the main goal for leaders across the country — and it will remain so over the next several months. The CDC released guidance on reopening higher ed institutions this week, and almost daily now, colleges are releasing their own plans for how they intend to open with students on-campus come fall. For many schools, part of the plan includes testing for SARS-CoV-2. "We're at the stage when every college and university president is acutely aware that if they open in the fall, they will need a testing regime," says Terry Hartle, of the American Council on Education, which represents 1,700 higher education groups, including colleges. "What they haven't figured out yet is where they'll get the tests, what the regime will look like and what the protocols will be. But those are things that they are thinking about every single day." At UC San Diego, there are about 5,000 students currently living in dorms on campus; many were unable to return home this spring. Starting last week, Schooley and his collaborators are asking students to voluntarily test, so they can see if their modeling and protocol for fall will work. They're hoping to scale up when the campus returns to full capacity — about 30,000 undergrad students — aiming to test about 70 to 75% of the community every month. Along the way they're learning valuable lessons: Wi-Fi at testing spots needs to be strong in order to link students' ID numbers to the code on the sample. Posting up outside a dorm at 7 a.m. isn't a great time to get a lot of students. And students are really freaked out about that swab; they'd much prefer a saliva test. Administrators are also learning about students' motivations. When the pilot launched last week, the initial messaging to students was, 'Are you curious? Come see if you're shedding the virus!' They didn't get a lot of volunteers. By day three, they had changed the pitch to, 'If you take this test it can help us have in-person classes in the fall.' Students came in droves. "They really want to get on with their lives and get on with their education," says Schooley. "If we can't get the university going, it's going to be very hard to get the rest of society going." UC San Diego is in a unique position because it has a lab, a hospital and a designated procurement team, which helps source components of the test. They're not facing test shortages like other communities have. Researchers there are working to develop new tests and components, to help diversify the materials used, so there are fewer shortages. "If you're a large university and you have a school of public health, obviously, that gives you a leg up," says Hartle. Smaller schools, he says, may need to work with local and state health departments to figure out a testing plan. But many schools are still in the early planning phases. "How do we get access to tests? I think that's the biggest question, because right now, locally, the access is for folks that are showing symptoms," says Kirsten Brinlee, the executive director of the Baltimore Collegetown Network, which works with 13 schools in the Baltimore area. "We've started to have some conversations about, you know, what could group ordering look like?" Joining with other colleges to plan has proved useful for colleges across the country, and it could make it easier to purchase tests in bulk, says Todd Greene, who leads the Atlanta University Center Consortium, a group made up of four historically black colleges in Atlanta, including Morehouse School of Medicine. Together they serve about 9,000, so that gives them leverage, buying power and an opportunity to think about scale. The medical school has "led the force" when it comes to testing, Greene says, but as a whole, the group hasn't made any final decisions regarding how they'll go about testing in the fall, though they're actively working through different scenarios. He says many testing companies and consultants have reached out to help. At their group meetings some important questions have emerged: Do we test our students before they arrive on campus? Or immediately upon arrival? And then how often to test? Are the tests available actually reliable? He says they're particularly concerned with issues of privacy and the disproportionate impact of the virus on communities of color. High costs when budgets are tight Even if colleges can get their hands on tests, they cost a lot: anywhere from $50 a test to triple that. Even with so much happening in-house, the project at UC San Diego is anticipated to cost more than $2 million per month in the fall. Timothy White, chancellor of the California State University system, which announced it is planning for a virtual fall semester, mentioned the cost of testing as a key factor in that decision. He estimated that mass testing would cost about $25 million a week. "It's just not practical at all for us to do that level" of testing, he told NPR. "For the size of our university, it is beyond the realm of the financial or practical possibility." Colleges are facing extreme financial pain right now, because of the pandemic. And the uncertainty surrounding the tests, how to get them and what tests are effective has made education leaders less likely to make large purchases now. "My gosh, if we could say, let's order these little saliva packs and we knew they'd be effective, then I think every college, every campus health center director would be like, 'how do I get that into my budget? Let's go get it.' But we're not quite at that level yet," says Judy Smith, who runs the health center on campus at Mercyhurst University, a campus of about 4,000 students in Erie, Pa. Smith says she's constantly following the news about testing and test developments, which are happening at "warp speed," and she's in communication with the local community about the coronavirus testing they're doing and the labs they're using to process those tests. "We know — well, we think we know — that we're not going to purchase diagnostic COVID testing at this point in time, when the test has to be done in the laboratory," she says. "We're not going to build a laboratory here on campus, I'm pretty confident in saying that." Regardless of the unbuilt lab, Smith says she's focused on making sure students on campus will be good with masking, social distancing and cleaning, when they open in the fall. A kind of insurance While the cost may be prohibitive for some colleges, others see it as an essential investment for being in-person. "We pay for all kinds of insurances," says Michael Le Roy, the president of Calvin University, a small Christian college in Western Michigan. "In many ways this is a similar kind of cost." He's planning for the 3,500-person campus to be open this fall. There are still lots of details to work out, with elements of social distancing, and reimagined dorms and in-person classes, but before the school solidified its plans, Le Roy felt it was especially important to get his hands on some tests. "No matter how you think about it, a program of testing was going to be critical to everything else," says Le Roy. "If we couldn't do that, almost everything else was going to be impossible or much harder." Through connections in the school's chemistry department, Le Roy made a deal with Helix Diagnostics, a commercial laboratory. For an undisclosed amount of money, the company will provide 5,000 coronavirus tests for students at Calvin. "It felt almost inappropriate, or wrong, to wait for the state or federal government to provide the tests," says Le Roy, "I just felt like, we're going to have to be tenacious." Now that the deal is done, there's a bit of relief. "I'm not saying that it solves everyone's problems," he says, "but it might be a way forward for us to begin to solve many problems." He says, there's still a long road ahead. "You feel a little like you're in the great beyond, so you get one thing in place and you're like — OK, the next thing!" Le Roy is the chair of Michigan Independent Colleges and Universities, and he's working to open up opportunities for other small schools throughout the state to get access to testing. He acknowledges that it may be harder, the more tests he needs to acquire. That's because there isn't an unlimited supply. "The reality is that reagents and supplies are still a challenge for a lot of us," says Michael Rao, the president of Virginia Commonwealth University and the president of the school's health system. "I do think that ultimately it's unrealistic and it has been unrealistic and it probably will remain unrealistic for some time to assume that we can all be tested all the time." He says in lieu of testing, screening and symptom tracking can be just as important for containing outbreaks. But, ultimately, it's going to come down to student behaviors. Because even with testing, the moment a student swabs their nose, and goes on with their day, they're making a million different decisions that impact the larger community. For campuses to function safely, he says, they are going to need a strong social contract that honors certain behaviors, and puts the health of the community first. "It's really less about just you and more about taking responsibility for everyone," he says, "The bottom line is that once we're together, we really do have to agree that these will be the fundamental policies and procedures that we're going to follow to respect each other and to protect each other and to help create a safe environment."

Huda is teaching Eslah how to make knafeh, a Middle Eastern dessert consisting of a thin noodle pastry stuffed with cheese, soaked in syrup and topped with pistachios. Warak enab, a dish of grape leaves stuffed with rice and meat, has always been a favorite Middle Eastern dish of mine. Growing up, I would sit with my mother at the dining room table as she taught me the technique — down to the detail of where to place my fingers — for wrapping the perfect warak enab. When I moved out of my childhood home, Mama would send me stacks of grape leaves, rolled into a burrito-like form, picked straight from the vines we grew in our backyard. I was on my own, but there was always comfort in being able to call or FaceTime her as I cooked.

             For iftar, the fast-breaking meal after sunset during Ramadan, a mixture of traditional and nontraditional Arabic foods, including lamb served with rice and a side of fattoush, an Arabic salad topped with fried pita bits. Through FaceTime, Mama walked me through many of her recipes: mjaddarah, a Lebanese lentil dish topped with caramelized onions, her vermicelli rice and leban, yogurt. After much trial and error, I perfected many of her complicated Middle Eastern dishes. I even felt confident in my grape leaf-wrapping skills. But I never quite mastered traditional Middle Eastern desserts. Baklava, knafeh, a pastry made of thin noodles, stuffed with cheese and soaked in syrup, and maamoul, a date-filled pastry topped with pistachio, required patience, time and skill I had yet to learn. I had never even attempted to bake with Mama. I just knew it would be too complicated, mostly because she rarely sticks to set measurements. It's as if she throws her ingredients into the air and a decadent, cheesy slice of knafeh magically appears in front of her.

This summer I was supposed to move from Washington, D.C., to New York to start a new job — but the coronavirus crisis postponed those plans. And so, I decided to move back into my parents' home. Initially, I was disappointed, but I recognized the rare opportunity I had to reconnect with my parents as an adult, especially during Ramadan, Islam's holiest month, which began on April 23 this year.

             One important aspect of Ramadan is the communal iftar dinners, where we break our fast together. No matter how much we eat, there's always room for knafeh. Desserts are a big part of Ramadan and Eid al-Fitr, the three-day celebration that marks the end of Ramadan. For my family, the sweet smell of knafeh and maamoul baking in the kitchen signifies the end of this special month. This year, Eid begins on the evening of May 23.

             Maamoul stacked on a platter in the way Attar's mother typically serves them. A couple of weeks ago, Mama and I were rearranging boxes of stuff I'd brought home, and we came across one of her old recipe books in the basement. She had brought it with her from Syria when she moved to the U.S. at age 24, right after she got married. She told me this book taught her almost everything she knew about cooking and baking — with occasional phone calls to her mother in Syria for assistance.

             Photos from a family vacation to Syria show baking bread and grape leaf vineyards. Moving back in has given me full access to Mama's world — her spices, her recipe books and the chaos that her kitchen turns into every time we cook or bake. It also has given me access directly to Mama, without a screen between us. So I asked her to teach me how to make the complicated maamoul and knafeh that once seemed so out of reach. 
                Eslah Attar writes: "Though I've never been much of a baker, both my older siblings are. My sister, Shorook, started experimenting with macarons, the French meringue-based sweet. This year, she added a twist, using ingredients like dates, rosewater and pistachios from Middle Eastern desserts like maamoul and knafeh."

Traditionally on Eid, Mama baked enough desserts to share at the local mosque and with friends. As the baklava trays piled up, my little brother and I would sneak a bite or two. Now, I know how to bake these delicious desserts myself, and I'm excited to put my skills to the test next Eid and carry on the family tradition. Learning how to bake with Mama at my side has been my favorite part of being home. It's brought us closer together and connected me to my roots while feeding my sweet tooth at the same time. I always underestimated the level of patience it takes to perfect this craft. Now, I see just how much skill — and love — are required.

             People load their vehicles with boxes of food at a Los Angeles Regional Food Bank earlier this month in Los Angeles. Food banks across the United States are seeing numbers and people they have never seen before amid unprecedented unemployment from the COVID-19 outbreak. Millions of newly impoverished people are turning to the charitable organizations known as food banks. Mile-long lines of cars, waiting for bags of free food, have become one of the most striking images of the current economic crisis. Donations are up, too, including from a new billion-dollar government effort called the Farmers to Families Food Box Program. Yet many people who run food banks are ambivalent about all the attention, because they know the limitations of their own operations. They point to a stream of food aid that's far more important than food banks: the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. Food banks actually have two separate functions. They provide food to people who need it, but they also find new homes for food that might go to waste — often because farmers and food companies haven't been able to sell it. This second job can be unwieldy and labor-intensive. Take, for example, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's new food bank donation program. It was set up, in large part, to relieve distress among farmers and food companies who can't find places to sell their products — like Borden Dairy, a Dallas-based milk processor which saw demand plunge when restaurants and schools closed in mid-March. The company couldn't find buyers for all the milk its farmers were producing, and asked some of them to simply dump the surplus. Too much milk As part of the new USDA program, though, Borden Dairy won a $137 million contract to send 44 million gallons of milk to charitable organizations, mainly food banks. Tony Sarsam, Borden Dairy's CEO, says it "gives a sense of purpose and meaning to this organization. And it's also important because we work with so many independent farmers. It gives them stability." More than a hundred companies got similar contracts from USDA, worth a total of $1.2 billion. They include wholesale distributors of fresh produce and meat. More contracts are coming, with the department expecting to spend about $3 billion on this new program. It has become an emergency buyer of surplus food, and the purchase price includes money to transport the food to food banks. Sarsam and other companies who've won USDA contracts now have to figure out how to give away these products. It means setting up a new and mostly unfamiliar supply chain. "We have to get off to the races, and find connections in the charitable community that can take our products. We've been on the phones non-stop," he says. It's more complicated than one might imagine. "Cold storage is a big deal; not everybody has enough cold storage for it," Sarsam says. So far, he's only found takers for about 10% of the milk that the company needs to give away to earn that full paycheck from the USDA. Robin Safley is on the receiving end of these donations. She's executive director of Feeding Florida, an association of twelve food banks. Those organizations deliver food to a couple of thousand small non-profit groups that hand it out to people at temporary distribution points known as food pantries. "First of all, we're grateful, right?" Safley says. "Grateful in a lot of ways." But the logistics of getting food to the right place at the right time is a challenge even in normal times. Throw in social distancing, volunteers worried about their safety, and a wave to potential donations from USDA-funded companies, and it gets downright daunting. "That means we have new people to deal with. How many trucks are they sending, and where are they sending them?" Safley says. "We don't want them to stack up on some of the other trucks that we have moving." She compares it to solving a Rubik's cube. The USDA has a separate program that buys commodities and donates them to food banks, but it's smaller than the new effort, amounting to roughly half a billion dollars worth of food donations each year. There is, however, a whole different way to help people get the food: Simply distribute money that people can use to buy groceries. Money instead of food This is what makes SNAP, formerly known as food stamps, so effective. Last year, 35 million people received $55 billion in SNAP benefits, down from a peak of 47 million people and $76 billion in 2013. The program, which falls under the aegis of the USDA, delivers roughly nine times more food to people than the entire Feeding America network, which includes food banks. Jess Powers, who's worked with several food assistance programs, says that this method — transferring money, rather than bags of produce — is better in a lot of ways. For one thing, she says, "it's just more efficient." SNAP recipients simply pay for groceries using an electronic benefits card. Also, people have more freedom to buy what they need, and the money they spend helps local businesses. "It has this multiplier effect in communities, and it's actually a better economic value because it creates economic activity," Powers says. Unlike the new USDA commodity purchases, though, SNAP does not solve the problems of farmers who've lost restaurant sales due to the pandemic. Food banks themselves, in fact, are among SNAP's biggest fans. "Those of us in the anti-hunger community, we truly believe that SNAP is far and away the most important component of our social safety net against hunger in our country," says Craig Gundersen, an economist at the University of Illinois who also works with Feeding America. Yet SNAP doesn't enjoy the same bipartisan applause as food banks. Over the years, many politicians  — mostly conservatives — have tried to restrict access to the program, citing relatively small scale abuses by recipients. Before the current crisis, the Trump administration had moved to cut access to SNAP for hundreds of thousands of people. It has since put those moves on hold, and it is allowing states to increase SNAP benefits to families that currently don't get the maximum amount. Some anti-hunger groups are calling on the USDA to go further, and boost the maximum amount of SNAP benefits that people can get. Gundersen says food banks do have a big role to play, and they have some distinct advantages. Unlike SNAP, anybody can show up and get food, with no proof of citizenship required and no complicated application procedure. "People may run out of money at some point over the course of the month, and they have their local food pantry where they can go get more food. Wonderful!" Gundersen says. But food pantries aren't big enough to do what SNAP does. Even with billions of dollars worth of extra food donations, they mainly just fill in the gaps. Puerto Rico struggles with less Puerto Rico, however, is in a notably different situation than the rest of the country. Instead of SNAP, Puerto Rico has a program called the Nutrition Assistance Program, which delivers significantly less aid to people on the island. And unlike SNAP, which spends more money when more people qualify for benefits, Puerto Rico's program has a fixed budget, which means that in tough times, like today, each deserving person has to make do with less assistance. As a result, charitable organizations in the territory have been shouldering a bigger share of the burden, and a leading food distributor in Puerto Rico, the Caribbean Produce Exchange, will soon be delivering food to them under a new USDA contract worth $107 million. Gualberto Rodriguez, the company's president, says he's gotten used to working with community organizations. After Hurricane Maria, the company also delivered food to them under contracts with the Red Cross and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. "We're a much poorer community here. So one thing we have is just a lot more webs of help that are embedded in our community," he says. "These are not strangers taking care of strangers. These are our neighbors taking care of neighbors. So it's a very special thing that happens when we go through these situations in the Caribbean and in Puerto Rico, in particular." But when asked whether it would be better to transfer money instead, so that people could buy food from local businesses, Rodriguez paused. "It's a great question," he said, finally. "I believe the commercial system works really well, if you empower people with the money to buy from it. It creates entrepreneurial activity where people figure out a way to address the needs of that person who has purchasing power. So I think it would [be better.]"

             President Trump listens as Scott Turner, executive director of the White House Opportunity and Revitalization Council, speaks during a meeting with African American leaders in Michigan on Thursday. The White House is looking at extending a tax break for investments in certain low-income neighborhoods as it tries to find ways to address the devastating impact of the coronavirus on communities of color in America. A provision in the 2017 tax cut law allows investors to defer and lower their capital gains taxes through 2026 if they invest their profits into designated "opportunity zones" –- areas struggling with high unemployment and low wages. White House adviser Ja'Ron Smith told NPR that the administration is looking "at ways that we can extend the legislation." 
                Ja'Ron Smith, a top White House aide to President Trump, says the administration is looking for ways to extend its Opportunity Zone program in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.

             Ja'Ron Smith, a top White House aide to President Trump, says the administration is looking for ways to extend its Opportunity Zone program in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. "We're having conversations with leaders to figure out how to best approach that," Smith said. "It's a tool and there's a number of other tools we want to leverage, but we want to holistically figure out how we can be a good federal partner." Smith declined to offer details on what an extension might entail. Opportunity Zones have been a centerpiece of Trump's reelection pitch to African American and Latino communities. But the coronavirus pandemic has brought the once booming economy that fueled these projects to a halt. Lawmakers are now asking the administration to make adjustments. Supporters of the tax breaks argue that the more than 8,700 zones have driven transformative investment in areas that otherwise would have been left behind. "One of the things we're very proud of is Opportunity Zones," President Trump said at a cabinet meeting this week. The program has not been without controversy, though. Critics say the tax incentives have benefited wealthy and connected investors more than local residents. The law also does not include reporting requirements that would enable the government to measure and track the effects of these investments. Once the pandemic hit, Republican Senator Tim Scott — a leading advocate for the tax breaks — called for the Treasury Department to immediately relax some of the deadlines for investing profits in the zones. One Republican-sponsored bill in the House of Representatives would also push the overall program out to 2030 to allow more time for investments. The additional leeway could make a difference, said Mark Elliott, managing partner for the South Carolina Opportunity Fund. Funds like Elliott's are the vehicle that investors use to get money behind projects in the zones and receive the tax benefits. "It's not going to hurt, and it may help a lot," Elliott said. "Extending it and loosening and making it a little broader, maybe that encourages more people to want to start businesses and to come back in these areas." Elliott's fund has $250 million invested in projects in zones right now. He said that some deals have slowed down due to the pandemic, but other avenues have also opened up, including the potential for developing a face mask manufacturing plant in South Carolina. Expanding Focus  The pandemic has had a devastating and disproportionate impact on black Americans, Latinos and other people of color in the United States. The White House has been looking for ways to address these disparities through an interagency council that previously had solely been focused on boosting opportunity zones. White House aide Smith said the council, led by Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson, has been talking with minority business organizations and advocates about legislation or administrative actions that could help. "The overall goal is prosperity everywhere," Smith said. "The COVID pandemic may have set us back in historic ways.

             White House aide Ja'Ron Smith speaks during a meeting President Trump held with African American leaders in Michigan on Thursday. Opportunity zones offer a way to help poor neighborhoods now dealing with the repercussions of a pandemic, said Shay Hawkins, who runs a trade group representing opportunity funds. "In previous recessions, these places were just going to continue to be left behind," Hawkins said. "Now we have something that at least shines a light and points ... investors towards these areas." Hawkins says his group supports immediate deadline extensions and the longer term extension of the program, as well as legislation that would expand reporting requirements, so the government and public will have a better picture of where investments are going. He says his members are seeing the pandemic increase demand to invest in businesses in these areas. But, there is some skepticism. Brett Theodos is a senior researcher at the Urban Institute, who has been studying opportunity zones. While a multi-year extension may make the program more attractive for investors, he said it's not going to "restart an economy that's on ice." Theodos said that based on current available data, the vast majority of investments so far have been in real estate and not in operating businesses. He also said, while there have been successes, it's not clear whether money is actually flowing to all of the zones. "To date, the program has been more flash than substance," he said. "It's not to say that there has been no investment. There clearly has. (But) there's been a lot more talk and attention on the program than actual material change or investment into communities."

             Old Navy, a subsidiary of Gap, began selling nonmedical face masks in early May. Retailers across the apparel world are turning to the newest essential garment to further their brand recognition and boost sales: the nonmedical face mask. Nordstrom announced Tuesday it would begin selling face masks for $4 each in packs of six. The move comes just weeks after the Seattle-based retailer announced it would permanently shutter 16 stores after the coronavirus pandemic forced all of its locations to close. 
                Nordstrom began selling nonmedical cloth face masks Tuesday. Two days later, the masks had sold out on Nordstrom's website.

             Nordstrom began selling nonmedical cloth face masks Tuesday. Two days later, the masks had sold out on Nordstrom's website. The company is the latest in a string of apparel brands to add face masks to its repertoire as demand continues to grow. Retail giants like The Gap and its subsidiaries, Banana Republic, Athleta and Old Navy, also began selling masks earlier this month. Despite the recent flood of new brands offering masks, the product is selling out across the market. Nordstrom's packs of masks are sold out just two days after coming on the scene, and many of Gap's masks are on back order until mid-June. Kim Kardashian West's brand SKIMS began selling face masks May 16 and sold out hours later. Unfortunately our @skims face masks have sold out today but we’re working with our local partner in LA to produce more as quickly as possible. The next batch will be available next week - please sign up to receive more details coming soon, and thank you for your support. However, selling out is not so much a function of demand as it is a reflection of the uncertainty looming over the retail industry in general, retail analyst Sucharita Kodali of Forrester told NPR. Retailers have no precedent to base the volume of their supply on, and no idea how long the demand will last. "There's just not data," says Kodali. "Nobody knew what to expect for what products because they'd never faced this dilemma before." Retailers also face a gummed-up supply chain, as many of the factories where these masks are manufactured are overseas, she says. The supply chain backups also allowed smaller companies to jump on the trend more quickly. "The smaller companies are more nimble, they're able to respond to changes more quickly. They see trends and they jump," she says. "Whereas for a lot of other companies, they're just hoping this passes. ... They're candidly just not as nimble." One of the nimble is e-commerce website Etsy. The site saw a giant spike of "face mask" in its search results in the first week of April, shortly after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's recommendation that face coverings be worn at all times in public, according to a company investor presentation. In April alone, the site grossed more than $130 million in face mask sales, according to the presentation.

"We sold over 12 million face masks in the month of April alone," CEO Josh Silverman said in a call with investors. "In fact, if face masks were a stand-alone category, it would have been the second biggest category on Etsy in the month of April." Etsy also saw a 79% increase from April of last year among other products, according to the presentation. "I would argue they were just in the right place at the right time," says Kodali. "When you think of who is able to consolidate the power of a million sewers in the country, the only answer is Etsy." Many brands are also using the worldwide demand for face masks as an opportunity to build positive engagement by making charitable donations of their face mask sales. Both Disney and the NBA have begun to sell masks with the commitment that proceeds will go to various charities. Disney, for one, took major losses in the first three months of 2020, with net income down 91% compared to the year before. Nordstrom and Gap have both donated masks to health care workers and other charitable causes.

Selling the masks is more a demonstration of how flexible a company can be in the face of the unexpected. "If you're a retailer and you don't have masks, that probably means you have bigger issues with your supply chain."

             North Carolina Department Health and Human Services Secretary Dr. Mandy Cohen speaks during a briefing on April 24. North Carolina's health and human services secretary says the Republican National Committee should "hope for the best, but plan for the worst" when it comes to having its convention in Charlotte in August. In an interview with WFAE, Dr. Mandy Cohen said mass gatherings will be a "very big challenge" if COVID-19 cases continue to increase in the state, as they are currently. "I think it's my advice to many entities, which is to have options, have scenarios," she said. "Because we don't know where we're going to be. I think you should hope for the best and plan for the worst." North Carolina will enter Phase 2 of its reopening Friday, with more businesses allowed to open. But that phase is stricter than originally planned. For instance, gyms and bars will remain closed. And there is still a limit of 10 people on indoor gatherings. Phase 2 is scheduled to last until at least June 26. The multi-day Republican nominating convention is scheduled to start Aug. 24. RNC Chair Ronna McDaniel said last week that convention planners are preparing for a normal event, and a Saturday news release from the RNC signifying 100 days until the convention said it still expected 50,000 people. But McDaniel said that the first week of July will be a critical period for planners. If state public health mandates are in place that would require an altered convention, the GOP would then begin working to modify its convention. She said the GOP could break the event into smaller venues and left the door open to holding parts of it outside. The Republican convention's Charlotte host committee, which must raise $70 million to bring the event to the city, said Thursday that its "advanced planning and thorough organization have kept us ahead of schedule, and we will continue to plan while following local and state guidelines." Delegates as spectators Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper's order allows for venues like Charlotte's Spectrum Center to hold sporting events or concerts in Phase 2. The order creates an exemption to the ban on indoor mass gatherings with more than 10 people, allowing for "entertainers, performers and athletes, along with coaches, training, support and broadcast staff." Cohen said the provision was included to allow venues to hold events that could be broadcast or streamed on the web.  For the RNC, delegates inside the arena would be considered as spectators. "That would be a spectator in my mind," Cohen said. "They would be sitting in the spectator's part of the Spectrum Center. And these are the kind of details we would work out with the RNC. But the staff that we meant are the ones who actually work at the Spectrum Center." That means that if the RNC were held in June, there would only be 10 delegates allowed inside the arena. It's possible that Phase 2 could be relaxed, or the state could enter Phase 3, which would allow more people to gather at one time. But Cohen said she's uneasy with any mass gathering this summer. "If we continue to see our numbers go up and we aren't in a different position, then mass gatherings are going to be a very big challenge," she said.  The number of COVID-19 patients in North Carolina is still increasing, though Cohen has said the state can move forward with a slow reopening because its testing capacity has increased and its hospitalizations are mostly level. The Democratic National Committee has said it may hold a virtual convention from Milwaukee. Its convention is scheduled to start Aug. 17, after being pushed back a month because of the pandemic. McDaniel has said the GOP will have an in-person convention. In an interview with the Washington Examiner last week, President Trump said he hopes the Charlotte convention will be held as planned. But he accused Cooper of "playing politics" by reopening the state slowly. "We'll have a convention," Trump said. "I'm a traditionalist, but we'll have to see, like everything else, but I think we'll be in good shape by that time. We have a great state, North Carolina, that's been very, very good. Although, it's got a Democrat governor, so we have to be a little bit careful. It's got a Democrat governor, so we have to be a little bit careful with that, because they're playing politics. They're playing politics, as you know, by delaying the openings." The president continued: "To me that's politics. They think it's a bad thing for me if they delay the opening. I think it's bad for them. And you have people protesting outside, and those people like Trump." A version of this story was first published by member station WFAE.

             In letters obtained by NPR, the Small Business Administration informs local Planned Parenthood affiliates that they are ineligible for loans received through the Paycheck Protection Program because of rules intended to limit the funds to small businesses and nonprofit organizations. Above, the Planned Parenthood health center in St. Louis on May 30, 2019. The Trump administration is asking local Planned Parenthood affiliates around the U.S. to return millions of dollars in loans received through the federal government's coronavirus relief package. In letters obtained by NPR, the Small Business Administration, which administers the Paycheck Protection Program, informs local affiliates that they are ineligible under the program's rules intended to limit the funds to small businesses and nonprofit organizations. In total, the letters say, Planned Parenthood affiliates nationwide have applied for more than $80 million through the forgivable-loan program, which was set up through the CARES Act. Under the program's rules, small businesses and nonprofits with fewer than 500 employees can apply for forgivable loans. Planned Parenthood officials say local member organizations that fall within those limitations — not the larger, national group — applied for and received the funds. The Small Business Administration asks affiliates to either return the funds or respond with documentation demonstrating eligibility for the program. The letters end with a warning that "if SBA determines that a borrower made a knowingly false certification" on a loan application, the agency "may refer the borrower for appropriate civil or criminal penalties." In a letter to Planned Parenthood of Metropolitan Washington, an SBA official notes that the organization in Washington, D.C., applied for a little more than $1.3 million in funds through the program, which was set up to help small businesses keep employees on payroll during the crisis. A similar letter to Planned Parenthood of Delaware references a loan application for $496,225. The letters were first reported by Fox News. Stephanie Fraim, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood of Southwest and Central Florida, told NPR that her organization received a little over $2 million, mostly to cover employee paychecks. "The economic uncertainty at that moment was profound, and the two weeks while we waited for this loan, we spent having some very tough conversations about what we would do if we didn't get this loan," Fraim said. Jacqueline Ayers, vice president of government relations and public policy at the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said the move by SBA is part of a politically motivated "relentless attack" by the Trump administration, which opposes abortion rights and has taken steps to restrict access to abortion and contraception. Since early on in the pandemic, groups opposed to abortion rights have expressed concern that coronavirus relief funds not be directed to organizations like Planned Parenthood. Many Planned Parenthood clinics provide abortions along with other reproductive health services, but using federal funds to pay for abortions is prohibited in most cases. Several Republican senators also are calling on Planned Parenthood affiliates to return funds distributed through the Paycheck Protection Program. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, the chairman of the Senate Committee on Small Business & Entrepreneurship, has said that taken together, Planned Parenthood affiliates have too many employees nationwide to be eligible under the program's rules. He said he wants the Small Business Administration to open an investigation into why and how the Planned Parenthood affiliates received the money. In an interview with NPR, Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.) also said Planned Parenthood should return the funds, as several prominent large businesses and organizations have done after coming under criticism. "That's what the Los Angeles Lakers have done. That's what Shake Shack has done. That's what Ruth's Chris [Steak House] has done," Lankford said. "So other organizations that it was exposed that they should not have taken the money have returned the money, so that would be the reasonable thing for them to be able to do." Legal experts say the Paycheck Protection Program's eligibility rules are somewhat unclear and have shifted as the program has rolled out. "They keep changing the rules," said Jessica Abrahams, who specializes in government contracting law at the firm Faegre Drinker Biddle & Reath. "So entities that qualified three weeks ago may not qualify today. There's a lot of confusion, a lot of concern."

             The U.S. Capitol is seen on April 13. Updated on May 29 at 1:15 p.m. ET The coronavirus pandemic has brought much of the daily work of Congress to a halt. House and Senate leaders delayed bringing back members for several weeks because of the outbreak and as public health guidelines recommended continued social distancing. The Senate finally returned in May, but the much larger House stayed mostly away as a result of advice from the attending physician to Congress. The same month, the House approved historic rule changes allowing remote voting and hearings.   During the outbreak, the virus has infected several lawmakers and forced many more members to self-quarantine. Some have announced symptoms from their home districts. And it remains an ongoing threat. Two Republican lawmakers, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Arizona Rep. Paul Gosar, were the first members of Congress to announce self-quarantines, on March 8. Both had attended the Conservative Political Action Conference in National Harbor, Md., a few days earlier. An attendant at the conference had fallen ill, its organizers revealed.  Loading...  The following week, two members of Congress were the first to announce they had tested positive for the illness. Florida Republican Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart and Utah Democratic Rep. Ben McAdams both said they developed symptoms after a March 14 vote on a coronavirus relief package. Since that time, dozens more lawmakers entered self-quarantine as a result of exposure to someone who was sick, including fellow members of Congress, constituents and dignitaries.  Capitol Hill has also seen staffers for lawmakers and workers become ill with COVID-19 symptoms. By May, more than 50 Capitol workers reported a positive test or symptoms, including more than a dozen members of the U.S. Capitol Police.  And some lawmakers have taken antibody tests to see if they were previously ill. Among them, Democratic Sens. Tim Kaine of Virginia and Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, both say they tested positive months after experiencing symptoms in the spring.   To stem the flow of new cases, both chambers have issued new social distancing guidance, such as encouraging the use of masks. The U.S. Capitol remains closed to public tours and open only to members, staff, press and official business visitors.  Loading...  This story was originally published on April 15, 2020.

             Blood collection tubes sit in a rack on the first day of a free COVID-19 antibody testing event at the Volusia County Fairgrounds in DeLand, Fla., on May 4. Salvador Perez got really sick in April. He's 53 and spent weeks isolated in his room in his family's Chicago apartment, suffering through burning fevers, shivering chills, intense chest pain and other symptoms of COVID-19. "This has been one of the worst experiences of his life," says Perez's daughter, Sheila, who translated from Spanish to English for an interview with NPR. "He didn't think he was going to make it." Perez recovered and now wants to go back to work as a chef at a Chinese restaurant. But his boss told him he needs a test — an antibody test — first. So he found a place to get one and tested positive. His blood indeed has antibodies to the novel coronavirus — proteins that his immune system produced when it fought off the pathogen. "He feels great that he can get ... back to work, since we haven't really paid our bills," Sheila Perez says. "And he feels great that he can start doing what he did before the virus again." But her father is also nervous. His doctor told him the antibodies might give him some protection against catching the virus again but also stressed that's far from guaranteed. 
                Salvador Perez became sick with symptoms of COVID-19 in April and spent weeks self-isolating at home in Chicago. When he recovered, his employer asked him to take an antibody test before he'd be allowed to return to work.

             Salvador Perez became sick with symptoms of COVID-19 in April and spent weeks self-isolating at home in Chicago. When he recovered, his employer asked him to take an antibody test before he'd be allowed to return to work. "He's anxious that he doesn't want to get sick. He's kind of scared of going back to work because ... he might go through it again," his daughter says. Salvador Perez is right to be worried. It's still not certain that antibodies measured by such a test would protect him from catching the virus again. And if the antibodies are protective, it's unknown how strong that protection might be or how long it might last. There are also questions about the reliability of many antibody tests being sold. Researchers are urgently trying to answer those uncertainties and figure how best to conduct antibody testing. Nevertheless,  increasing numbers of people are getting the tests — many without recognizing how much is still unknown about what the results mean. Some employers, such as Perez's restaurant, are requiring workers to take antibody tests if they want to continue working or return to their jobs. Others are getting employees tested to see how widely the virus has spread through their workforce and to try to find ways to improve worker safety. And some labor unions are helping workers get tested in hopes of offering them some sense of security against the virus. In addition, some individuals are buying the tests themselves out of curiosity and to use as a basis for personal decisions, such as whether it's safe to start spending more time with close friends and extended family members who are outside the household. But the idea of using antibody testing in these ways worries many doctors and public health authorities because there are many common misconceptions. For starters, the antibody tests are only a sign of past infection. Whether the infection is actually gone can only be determined by a diagnostic test that identifies genetic material from the virus or viral particles. Some people also falsely think testing positive on an antibody test proves they can't get infected with the virus again. "I think people just want this to go away and want to resume their normal lives," says Kelly Wroblewski, director of infectious disease for the Association of Public Health Laboratories. "But my fear is [antibody tests are] going to be used as this sort of golden ticket to demonstrate immunity — when we just don't know if that's the case." Still, Wroblewski and others acknowledge the results might offer at least some useful guidance in certain cases. "If I had a household where I had a number of younger individuals in the household, one of whom had antibodies, I think that that individual would probably be the safest bet to be able to safely go to get the groceries," says Michael Mina, an assistant professor of immunology and infectious disease at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. But, Mina quickly adds, "I still wouldn't want that individual going to get groceries and then going the next day to a nursing home to see Grandma." Having antibodies against the coronavirus is just no guarantee that you won't pick up or pass along an infection, he says. Still, antibody testing could provide researchers with valuable information for studying overall trends in the epidemic, such as how many people in the community have actually been exposed to the virus. Antibody testing could also help identify people who could donate blood plasma containing antibodies; such plasma is being investigated for possible treatments for COVID-19 patients. 
                Immunologist Juanita Mora has been arranging antibody testing in Chicago for people who need the test to go back to work. A positive test doesn't guarantee immunity from coronavirus reinfection, she tells her patients. Social distancing and other precautions are still important.

             Immunologist Juanita Mora has been arranging antibody testing in Chicago for people who need the test to go back to work. A positive test doesn't guarantee immunity from coronavirus reinfection, she tells her patients. Social distancing and other precautions are still important. Dr. Juanita Mora, an immunologist at the Chicago Allergy Center, helped Perez and his family get tested with one of the tests that's at least been approved for use by the Food and Drug Administration. (The agency recently cracked down on unregulated tests.) Mora has been doing the same for an increasing number of people in Chicago's Latino community who are being required to get antibody testing by their employers. "They want to go back to work and feed their families," Mora says. "They need the money." She says she makes sure her patients understand that they still have to be careful and can't let down their guard just because they get positive results on an antibody test. "Having positive antibodies may mean that you have some protection, but you can still get it again," Mora tells her patients. "And then you want to protect your loved ones, right? So you want to teach your kids the right thing to do. "So, keep the face cloth on. Keep the social distancing, and so forth," Mora advises her patients.  But people are not just getting antibody tests to go back to the workplace. Jon Pepper and his wife, Diane, who live in New York City, had been wondering whether they had COVID-19 ever since they got sick in April. He's 64, and they've simply wondered whether they might now have some immunity to the virus. He decided to get a $119 antibody test directly from Quest Diagnostics, a big commercial laboratory that now sells the test to anyone who wants one. Diane Pepper was soon tested, too. "The reality is people are going to be scrambling to get testing," says Dr. Jay Wohlgemuth, Quest's senior vice president and chief medical officer. "They're going to get any testing they can get their hands on. We see this is a responsible way to get testing." The company says it's a responsible provider — it makes sure a doctor explains the results.

             Jon Pepper and his wife, Diane, live in New York City. They took an antibody test after recovering from an undiagnosed illness in April to confirm their suspicions that they'd had COVID-19. The Peppers say testing positive on the antibody test gave them peace of mind. "I feel like we have some level of protection that our bodies have have been through this, and they're fighting back," Jon Pepper says. "And they have the capacity to fight back further if necessary. "So I think it's something that's in my corner in getting through this," he adds, "and especially in a hot spot like New York City, where we're surrounded by people who have been exposed to this and infected." Pepper says he and his wife are still being cautious. They stay at least 6 feet away from other people when they go outside. And they're wearing masks when they go shopping. But Pepper and his wife are now thinking about having their adult children over for dinner for the first time in months. "At some point we have to resume life again. And based on this test I feel like we have some sense — a bit of security," Pepper says.
                When the real world seems too constrained, the endless horizons of Minecraft can be soothing.

             When the real world seems too constrained, the endless horizons of Minecraft can be soothing. "Honey, I'm going out for an adventure!" E. closes the door behind him and steps out into the world. I stay put, cooking up ideas for home improvement. We've only known each other for a few months, but once the pandemic threw our lives off balance, we decided to move in together. In a house we built. In Minecraft. The house is modest — a pixelated, underground starter home made of dirt and cobblestone. In one corner is a large chest for storing our inventory. Nearby, a crafting table and a stove convert raw materials into something useful. There's a bed for our re-spawn location, which means I won't get lost the next time I drown or get blown up by a creeper — a recurring issue early on. And on the opposite wall, there's a pen of clucking chickens. On second thought, not the best place for the chickens. Later, we'll upgrade to a multi-story castle atop a mountain — but for now, it's home. Right now, my life's parameters are my bedroom, my ambitions are the size of 80 bedrooms, and my Minecraft realm is the size of a zillion bedrooms. Downloading Minecraft wasn't my first instinct when I stopped going to my office and everywhere else. I've never self-identified as a gamer in my adult life, and I certainly didn't think the antidote to screen fatigue could be more screen time. Plus, video games always struck me as chaotic, and I was maxed out on chaos. As kids, my older brother and I would settle into an afternoon of Tekken 4 or James Bond 007: Nightfire, battling enemies and each other on an otherwise calm day. It was thrilling, and I'd ride that anxious buzz of trying to survive until it was time for something else. It's strange how much you can learn about yourself as a child when your avatar is a buxom woman named Pussy Galore. I discovered I only really had fun when my brother and I were on the same team, and friendly fire was turned off. I noticed that random civilian casualties made me feel sick. I questioned why lady avatars were scantily clad while dude avatars often weren't. And I loved getting to sight-see. Sightseeing is why Minecraft has had such an impact. Right now, my life's parameters are my bedroom, my ambitions are the size of 80 bedrooms, and my Minecraft realm is the size of a zillion bedrooms. The game offers endless virtual space to roam when real-life space feels like a rare commodity. And relocation is the literal click of a button. When I tire of the mines, I try the mountains. When I'm done with the mountains, I go to the jungle. And when I've had it with the jungle, I hop in a boat that I made with oak from the jungle and find a new island to inhabit. Then I can do it all over again. The game's natural world is artificial, but there's something kind of enchanting about that block-shaped moon overhead. Offline, my weeks have been punctuated with worry about the strain I'm putting on my household's resources. But Minecraft promises a retreat where raw materials are always plentiful and useful — water for putting out lava, iron for swords and pickaxes, cobwebs for string, animals for food. Neither climate change nor a pandemic can threaten this virtual cornucopia. Lately, I've discovered an affinity for running through open fields and punching grass. The satisfying crunching sound leads me to five-minute punching sprees from time to time, but this isn't nihilism. It's practical. Every few squares of freshly punched grass unearth little seeds that keep my chickens procreating and my farm plentiful. It's a blissed-out vision of sustainability. Let's be clear, though: Minecraft is not a utopia. Days whiz by, and when that 32-bit block of sun starts to set, monsters are coming for me. In the mines, too. Exploding creepers, arrow-toting skeletons, mumbling zombies, nimble spiders, and mystifying enderman you can't make eye contact with. I'm not very good at fighting these yet, but at least I can count on the game's sonic and visual cues to let me know danger is afoot. Plus, I'm armed for battle. There are rules and boundaries within which I can almost guarantee safety. And if all else fails, I'll come back to life in the same place I started: My bed, in my simple underground house, out of harm's way. I can't say the same of the coronavirus. These days, I'm clinging to structure. Time is passing quickly, and if I'm honest, I don't always yearn to make days feel longer or fuller. But when I close my bedroom door and open up a virtual world, I can feel the therapy of making things up as I go. Of itching for daylight so I can return to feeding chickens and building a castle on a mountain. Of experiencing something — making actual memories — when togetherness feels out of reach.

             Bartolomé Perez of Los Angeles has cooked at McDonald's for 30 years. He helped stage a walkout at his restaurant in April after a coworker tested positive for COVID-19. Bartolomé Perez has made countless vats of fries and flipped more burgers than he cares to remember in his 30 years of working at a McDonald's in Los Angeles. In that time, he's joined several strikes to demand higher wages and better benefits for workers. But the stakes felt very different during the coronavirus pandemic. "We are between life and death," Perez says, speaking in Spanish. "You know that every time you go out, it could be your last ... it could be the most expensive hamburger you make in your life." FACES OF THE CORONAVIRUS RECESSION Jobs lost. Businesses in peril. Meetings gone virtual. Faces Of The Coronavirus Recession offers snapshots of working lives upended by the pandemic. Perez helped stage a walkout at his restaurant in April after a coworker tested positive for COVID-19. It was part of a big wave of protests by low-wage workers in retail, food and delivery. Protesting workers were demanding more access to protections against the virus, like masks and disinfectant. That's in addition to other demands they raised long before the pandemic, like higher pay, more predictable schedules, better health care and other benefits. McDonald's has said the health and safety of its workers was of "utmost importance" and told NPR that Perez's location had been closed for a "thorough deep cleaning" and had "ample supply of gloves, masks and soap." It said the protests "do not represent the feedback we are hearing from the majority of employees across the country." Perez says, "We have always been essential. It's just that the company strategizes a narrative about us workers, saying that all we do is flip burgers, that we are replaceable." Editor's note: McDonald's is among NPR's financial supporters.

             In Afghanistan, a group of teenage girls are trying to build a mechanized, hand-operated ventilator for coronavirus patients, using a design from M.I.T. and parts from old Toyota Corollas. It sounds like an impossible dream, but then again, the all-girls robotics team in question is called the "Afghan Dreamers." Living a country where two-thirds of adolescent girls cannot read or write, they're used to overcoming challenges. The team of some dozen girls aged 15 to 17 was formed three years ago by Roya Mahboob, an Afghan tech entrepreneur who heads the Digital Citizen Fund, a group that runs classes for girls in STEM and robotics and oversees and funds the Afghan Dreamers. "I'm really proud of these young girls – [who are] feeling that they have to help their community," says Mahboob. "It's amazing and hopeful for the future of Afghanistan."  The virus most likely entered the country in early March as hundreds of thousands of Afghan workers fled the coronavirus outbreak in neighboring Iran. They came through the western province of Herat, where the Afghan Dreamers live. In fighting the pandemic, Afghanistan is at a disadvantage."You are talking about a country that is now struck by COVID-19, which comes on top of ongoing war and abject poverty," says Toby Lanzer, the humanitarian coordinator for U.N. agencies working in Afghanistan. The country only has capacity to test 1,000 people a day, so the number of confirmed cases, at over 7,000 is considered an undercount, says Lanzer. And there's only about 200 working ventilators for a country of 35 million people, he estimates. To deal with the shortfall, on March 26, the then-governor [he has since stepped down] of Herat, Abdul Qayoum Rahimi, gathered two doctors, university graduates, local industrialists and the Afghan Dreamers. The doctors presented them with a challenge: to help mechanize their hand-operated ventilators, also known as bag-valve-masks. This type of ventilator is a large inflatable bag attached to a mask that slips over the nose and mouth. A health worker manually squeezes the bag to get air into the lungs. They're quite cheap and common – they're used in ambulances and in emergency care to help patients breathe until they can be ventilated on a machine. Officials feared there would not be enough health workers to hand-operate the equipment in the event of an outbreak. They hoped the Afghan Dreamers could build a prototype of a mechanized ventilator that could be replicated and mass produced, says Mahboob. And amid a global demand, officials also worried that impoverished Afghanistan could not compete with wealthy countries to buy fully automated ventilators typically used in ICU rooms. A ventilator typically costs around $50,000, says Douglas Chin, a Harvard-educated surgeon who has been helping the Afghan Dreamers with their prototype. By comparison, he says, producing a mechanized hand-operated ventilator could cost around $500.  
                Elham Mansori, Florence Poya, Nahida Khajazadeh and Somaya Farooqi, members of the Afghan Dreamers, are building a mechanized version of the hand-operated ventilator.

             Elham Mansori, Florence Poya, Nahida Khajazadeh and Somaya Farooqi, members of the Afghan Dreamers, are building a mechanized version of the hand-operated ventilator. After the meeting with the governor, a team of four Afghan Dreamers began looking online for open-source design ventilators. Mahboob and Somaya Farooqi, the 17-year-old team captain, came across a design released by MIT for a low-cost, low-tech ventilator called the MIT E-Vent. "They found us," says Alexander Slocum, a professor of mechanical engineering at MIT, whose team released the design in March.  The design is deliberately low-tech so it can be replicated using locally sourced products around the world. For instance, it calls for installing a microprocessor, usually included in robotics kits for kids and teens. And it can be built out of widely available machine parts. The MIT team on their website says their design "cannot replace an FDA-approved ICU ventilator in terms of functionality, flexibility and clinical efficacy" but that it could help in "life-or-death situations where there is no other option." Slocum estimates about a dozen teams, from places as diverse as Chile to Iran are building ventilators using the design. The Afghan Dreamers, he says, is the only all-female team he is aware of, and they come from the poorest country. They were also the first to figure out that windshield wiper motors could be finagled into powering a working ventilator. "So I just hope no one gets mad at us, or them, in particular when the rainy season comes and they go to their car and there's no wipers," says Slocum, jokingly. The Afghan Dreamers have had a number of challenges while building the prototype. For one, they're working while fasting – it's the Muslim month of Ramadan. They also have to keep safe amid the pandemic, says Farooqi. "Each of us work on a separate part of the ventilator. When we get together, we wear masks and gloves."

                hide caption
             And because Herat is largely shut down due to COVID, Farooqi says the team had to be ingenious about sourcing parts. "Most of the material we are using is actually from Toyota Corolla car parts" from nearby secondhand markets, such as the windshield wipers, a gear box and motor, along with some motorbike parts. Corollas are a common type of car in Afghanistan, so if this prototype works, the ventilator should be cheap and easy to replicate using parts likely to be available at car shops, says Mahboob. The girls are now trying to get the machine to be able to sense a patient's breathing pattern and adjust the amount of air they get accordingly.  For the ventilator to do that, the team needs two parts – a "pressure transducer" – a sensor that converts pressure measurements from breath into electrical signals – and a microprocessor to process those signals into a pump of air. Both parts cost about $50 each but the team can't source them locally or ship them into Afghanistan. There is no mail service that the women can access.  And so six weeks into building their ventilator, the women are now trying to find a way get these last parts. Some health officials in Afghanistan are doubtful that the girls will succeed. "We appreciate this idea," says Muhammad Rafiq Sherzai, spokesman for the Herat Public Health Department. But he notes the need to have the machines approved by appropriate organizations. Indeed, once the team builds a successful prototype, it has to be tested and approved by the health ministry in Herat, and then in the capital Kabul. Once they have that approval, local factories can replicate the machine. The team is optimistic. They've overcome other hurdles. They first came to international attention three years ago, when they were refused visas twice to enter the U.S. for a robotics competition. Many visit visas are denied because some Afghans have used them to stay in the U.S. and never return to Afghanistan. After an international outcry, President Donald Trump intervened and let them in. They made it to the competition and even won an award for courage for their can-do attitude under difficult circumstances. "That award was a result of our hard work. And it's made us work even harder," says Farooqi. Speaking of the ventilator her team is building, she adds, "even if it saves just one patient's life, I'll be happy.
                Hydroxychloroquine, a drug used to prevent malaria and treat certain autoimmune conditions, is being studied to treat or prevent COVID-19.

             Hydroxychloroquine, a drug used to prevent malaria and treat certain autoimmune conditions, is being studied to treat or prevent COVID-19. Publicity around the drug hydroxychloroquine spiked this week when President Trump revealed that he's taking it to prevent COVID-19.  All the attention on the drug in recent months is increasingly spilling into science and making it harder for some researchers to actually study whether the drug has potential for COVID-19.  Doctors have used hydroxychloroquine for decades to treat autoimmune conditions and to prevent malaria.  While the Food and Drug Administration has given emergency use authorization for doctors to try the treatment on COVID-19 patients, the agency has also cautioned about possible deadly side effects. On Wednesday, the executive director of the World Health Organization's emergencies program, Dr. Mike Ryan, echoed other leading medical experts, saying at a press briefing that hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine have "yet to be found effective in the treatment of COVID-19" or for preventing the disease.   Because of potential side effects, Ryan says the WHO advises the drug "be reserved" for use in the context of clinical trials, which are underway in many places.  But for some researchers, running such trials is becoming more difficult because of the controversy around the drug.  Missed opportunity  Dr. Jon Giles didn't expect to have any problems drumming up interest in his clinical trial testing if hydroxychloroquine can help prevent COVID-19. "We were getting calls all the time from people who were interested," says Giles, an epidemiologist and rheumatologist at Columbia University.  For his study, Giles planned to give a short course of the medication to people who were "household contacts" of COVID-19 patients. Like many of the ongoing trials, it would be randomized with a control group. By the end of April, Giles was ready to start enrolling people. But his team ran into a problem when they started calling potential participants.  "Pretty much everybody said, 'Well that's the drug that's dangerous to your heart,' or, 'I talked to my friends and they said don't take it,' or that 'I saw on TV it's dangerous,' " says Giles.  Just a month earlier, he says demand for the drug was soaring. Some patients with autoimmune conditions couldn't even get their prescriptions filled, after Trump spoke enthusiastically about the drug.  In April, the FDA issued a warning about using the drug for COVID-19 patients without strict medical supervision in a hospital or as part of a clinical trial. The agency had received reports of serious heart-related adverse events and death in patients with COVID-19 receiving hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine.  But the back-and-forth headlines and the ongoing political wrangling seemed to make people wary of the medication, Giles says, even in the context of a carefully run clinical trial.  "It became almost impossible to get anyone interested," says Giles.  Giles says the committee overseeing his study added a new requirement: that study participants needed to have had an electrocardiogram within the last year.  As a rheumatologist, Giles knows the medication better than most doctors because he prescribes it to many of his patients.  "It's a very, very safe drug; it's been used for over 75 years," he says. "When I give someone hydroxychloroquine, I don't get an ECG or do blood monitoring."   Giles was planning to enroll otherwise healthy people and screen out anyone who could be at risk of heart problems. But that new requirement, plus the negative press, made it too difficult to find study subjects.  He gave up on doing the study. He says it's a missed opportunity. "It's not unreasonable to think that a short course of this drug might have some protective ability," he says.  Risks and potential The concern over cardiac risk for hospitalized patients is real, says Dr. Mark Poznansky, director of the Vaccine and Immunotherapy Center in the Infectious Disease Division of Massachusetts General Hospital. Even though the drug has been used safely to prevent malaria, he says, "that is very different from using the drug in acutely ill patients with COVID-19." He recently published a review of the evidence for using hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19 that casts doubt on its effectiveness.  "The data up to date ... doesn't make one entirely optimistic that we are going to find something different in a clinical trial," he says.  Poznansky notes a recent study of nearly 1,400 people with moderate to severe COVID-19 found no benefit and concluded that the drug should not be routinely used on patients.  He says the drug should only be used in the context of clinical trials "or under strict compassionate use, in order to do no harm." Still, Poznansky doesn't rule out that further well-designed trials could turn up better results. 'The virus doesn't care about politics' At Henry Ford Health System in Detroit, cardiologist Dr. William O'Neill says enrollment for their clinical trial studying hydroxychloroquine to prevent COVID-19 plummeted in late April. "It really caused a huge problem for us," O'Neill says. "It set us back probably a month."  O'Neill attributes the drop in enrollment to the FDA warning and a highly publicized study of over 300 hospitalized veterans with COVID-19. The authors of that study found the drug did not reduce the need for a ventilator and even linked hydroxychloroquine to higher death rates. However, the study wasn't a rigorous controlled trial and the results weren't peer-reviewed.  "That was interpreted as a warning that the drug is dangerous," says O'Neill. But he says, using it for prevention is a different matter than treating already sick patients. "Everything that we see about hydroxychloroquine suggests that the earlier you use the drug, the more likely it is to be effective."  O'Neill says the fact that President Trump is touting this drug means it now has become a political flashpoint. "It has made people absolutely committed to proving him wrong," he says.  "The problem with that is this is not politics, this is life and death," he says. "We're talking about a treatment. Who would be rooting for us not to find a therapy, for God's sakes?" Multiple clinical trials involving hydroxychloroquine are underway at the University of Washington in Seattle. But Dr. Christine Johnston says recruitment has become a major challenge.  "We are hearing now from some participants that the study and the drug feel too political and they just don't want to participate at all," says Johnston. "As physicians, we would not do something that we thought was harmful." Johnston's colleague, professor Dr. Ruanne Barnabas, is trying to recruit 2,000 patients to test whether the drug can prevent COVID-19.  "A clinical trial is the only way that we will be able to answer this question quickly and with high confidence," she says.  Researchers at Duke University are also testing whether hydroxychloroquine can be a new tool for prevention during the pandemic. But Duke professor of medicine Dr. Susanna Naggie says they need to be able to recruit enough people.  "I do worry that there are many well-controlled trials that are underway where we won't get an answer," says Naggie. "That, I think, would be a shame." Another researcher conducting large trials, Dr. Wesley Self, says the coverage of hydroxychloroquine has felt a bit like an "emotional roller coaster," which has led to more questions from patients.  "I actually find it helpful," says Self, an emergency physician at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. "We're giving people relatively low doses of hydroxychloroquine, which we believe are quite safe. And we're monitoring for side effects very closely." Self is the lead investigator of the ORCHID trial that focuses on hydroxychloroquine in treating hospitalized COVID-19 patients.   "This is a perfect situation for a clinical trial to really understand what the balance of those benefits and risks are," he says. Another large clinical trial is looking at whether hydroxychloroquine and the antibiotic azithromycin can keep people with COVID-19 from being hospitalized or dying.  "We think the way that this medication works, it would be better to take it early, rather than later, especially when somebody is really really sick already," says Dr. Davey Smith, head of Infectious Diseases and Global Public Health at University of California San Diego School of Medicine.  "In reality, the virus doesn't care about politics and science should also not care about politics," Smith says. "I just want an answer one way or the other."For Ananay Arora, this spring has brought good news and bad news. The good news: The Arizona State University sophomore snagged one of the most prestigious internships in the country. He'll be working with the software engineering team at Apple. The bad news: Instead of rubbing elbows with Tim Cook at the company's futuristic ring-shaped headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., Arora will be working remotely from his off-campus apartment in Tempe, Ariz.. He's an international student from New Delhi, which means he can't go home to his family right now, and pandemic restrictions mean he can't relocate to California. "They're shipping a Mac and a monitor," he says. "So I'm going to set up my workstation at my apartment. That's the good part about software engineering. It's not ideal, but 100% of it is possible to be done from home." Summer internships have become a key path to the job market for ambitious college students. The internships are coveted and sometimes controversial, with less privileged students often not being able to afford to take unpaid positions. But this year, with most office buildings emptied out and the economy under severe hardship, will internships be canceled? Well, Arora teamed up with two Arizona State classmates, Kaan Aksoy and Devyash Lodha, to create a website answering precisely that question: Ismyinternshipcancelled.com. They've crowdsourced information from more than 500 companies so far, big and small, ranging from American Airlines to Walmart to Zillow. The verdict? Just over a third of the internship programs are canceled outright. Most of the rest are moving online for part or all of the summer. And some companies are even expanding their programs. In fact, the CEO of Cloudflare, an Internet security company, told TechCrunch that he decided to double his incoming class of interns after seeing Arora's website. Dan Rosensweig is the CEO of Chegg, which runs the site Internships.com. He says he's seeing a "hodgepodge" when it comes to summer opportunities around the country. "Internships have been canceled at companies of all sizes," Rosensweig says. "Larger companies are doing it remote." His site lists "remote finance," "remote data science" and "remote software" as "hot markets." He adds that outright cancellations seem to be clustered in harder-hit industries such as travel — Airbnb, for example, and airlines. Rosensweig's company is going for a hybrid approach. It's starting internships remotely but hoping to invite interns back into its offices sometime in mid-July. That will depend on location, of course; Chegg has offices in the Bay Area, Portland, Ore., and New York City. He notes that, when compared with being able to train students face-to-face, "it'll be harder." But he adds, "We intend to pay them, and we intend to have it because we know how important the internship experience is to the growth of a college student." It's not only the tech industry that is continuing to support interns through this crisis. Hamilton College, a private college in New York state, is one that has extended the funding it offers for unpaid and underpaid internships to graduating seniors. Ngoc Ngo, who is taking a few years off before medical school, is taking advantage of that. She's got not one but three projects lined up for the summer: first, an extension of her senior thesis research in genetics; the second is a market research position with CVS Health, and third, research on the microbiome at an Irish university — all three from her home. The work will be less hands-on and involve more spreadsheets, but she says it's more than she would be doing if she had to commit to a single lab location for the summer. "I feel that I'm so fortunate," she says. "That I'm able to even apply for these positions is truly a privilege." Another out-of-the-box option for aspiring interns this year is the Virtual Student Federal Service. This program has been around for a decade, offering monthlong remote, and unpaid, assignments with dozens of different federal agencies, from NASA to the Smithsonian Institution. In recent summers, it has coordinated about 1,200 interns, says Nora Dempsey, who runs the program. "Because [of the] coronavirus, our phones and our email boxes are brimming with interest by folks we've never heard from before," she says, "agencies with long, complicated names coming to us for the first time saying, 'How do you work virtually? I hear you've been working virtually for 10 years. And can we join in and how can we do this?' " Dempsey says the program has created 184 new slots in the past couple of weeks. And applications for students are still open now. Where To Find A Summer Internship Remote internships, of course, aren't possible in every sector — think of retail or construction. The experts I spoke with say online internships work best when they're project-based, allowing interns to complete assignments on their own time. Mentors should be assigned to work closely with each intern to make sure they don't get lost in the shuffle. Arora is trying to build community among his fellow interns. He helped start up a series of group chats that now has hundreds of incoming Apple interns on it. "We're hosting things like Zoom socials just to meet with each other. Asking some questions of previous interns," he says. "So it's a fun time, meeting other people." Still, he says he's sad he's missing out on the networking and camaraderie of working at Apple's headquarters. "If the internship was in person, it would have been much better because, you know, you get to make these connections," he says. "You get to meet new people. You have people walking by who are seeing how you're working. And so it's a totally different experience."Nursing homes were not on our minds much before the COVID-19 pandemic. Then their residents began dying by the thousands. While there are no definitive figures, nursing home residents and staff appear to account for about one-third of the roughly 90,000 COVID-19 related deaths in the U.S., according to The New York Times. Those figures may be low because some states do not report such figures and the CDC is just beginning to collect them. The stunning death toll has brought scrutiny to an industry that many believe is due for an overhaul. Questions about the way it's paid for, staffing levels, adequate training for staff, effective regulations and oversight all are raging as states battle to control the ravages of the pandemic. "There's lots of hubbub" around nursing homes, says Dr. Louise Aronson, a geriatrician, professor of Medicine at UC San Francisco, and author of Pulitzer Prize finalist Elderhood. And it's important, she says, that the public keep that focus. "The way we've created nursing homes," she says, "they're so separate from real life that it's altogether too easy for people to go back to their lives and just kind of forget about it and not make a difference." There have long been ideas among people who study nursing homes — or work in them — for ways to make them safer and more humane. Before the pandemic, these ideas weren't of much interest to anyone outside the field. But those proposed innovations are now attracting a wider audience.   What first drew that wider audience was the shocking speed with which the coronavirus tore through nursing homes. But slowly, they're learning that nursing homes struggled with infection control long before the coronavirus came around. It's the most frequently cited deficiency by health inspectors. Annually, well over a million nursing home residents contract infections and as many as 388,000 die from them. Even after the pandemic began, nursing home inspectors found that one-third of nurses and nursing assistants did not wash their hands properly and a quarter were using personal protective equipment (PPE) incorrectly. But nursing homes haven't had to worry about inspectors citing them for those failings, says Charlene Harrington, a professor of Nursing and Sociology at the University of California San Francisco. "The fines are so small that they don't really have an impact on the nursing home," she says. "It's just the cost of doing business." The pandemic exposed the weaknesses of the nursing home system. Facilities were short of PPE. Tales abounded of nursing home staff wearing rain ponchos and goggles from hardware stores because they couldn't get proper gowns and face shields. Yet, the federal government only began providing supplies this month, and it's not much: FEMA says it will send two shipments, each containing a one week supply of PPE, to every nursing home in the country by July 4. Nursing homes also have not been a priority for testing, which is a key step to catching infections before they can spread. In a recent phone call with state governors, Vice President Mike Pence encouraged them to see that all nursing home residents and staff were tested for the coronavirus, but the Trump administration is not mandating this. Yet, despite nursing homes overwhelming number of cases and deaths, obtaining tests has remained a struggle. "Do I feel that sometimes maybe nursing homes get the short shrift of things?" asks Daniel Ruth, president and CEO of the San Francisco Campus for Jewish Living, which includes a skilled nursing facility. "The answer is 'yes.' Our acute hospital partners have a much louder voice for advocacy." But now that nursing homes have the public's attention, the industry is pushing for more support. The American Health Care Association and the affiliated National Center for Assisted Living have asked Congress and the Trump administration for $10 billion. They say the money will be used for additional staff, hazard pay, and to make up for the losses they've taken due to their inability to admit new patients during the COVID-19 crisis. "The truth is that nursing homes have not failed America. The public health system has failed nursing homes," said Mark Parkinson, president and chief executive officer of the American Health Care Association and National Center for Assisted Living, in a column by the Morning Consult. "Long-term care facilities are doing everything possible to stop the spread of this virus. But we need help." The two trade organizations commissioned a survey showing overwhelming numbers of voters think that nursing homes deserve more financial support from the federal government. More financial support could come with a price. Congressional Democrats have introduced legislation that would create new requirements for nursing homes in staffing, infection control, and quality of life for residents. Long-time nursing home analysts offer some other innovative ideas. Smaller is better "I've been teaching nursing homes and studying this area for 20 plus years," says David Grabowski, professor of Health Care Policy at Harvard School. "I'm still waiting for the individual that wants to go to a nursing home; that person probably isn't out there." Grabowski says that's in part because the facilities value the needs of the institution over the needs of the individuals who make their homes there. "I would really think about smaller home environments where we value the caregivers and we value the residents," Grabowski says. He imagines houses with just eight to 12 residents living together. "I think in general, we've had way too much focus in terms of regulation on quality of care and not enough on the quality of life in these homes." Limiting occupancy can also help control the spread of infection, says Daniel Ruth, CEO and president of the San Francisco Campus for Jewish Living. "I absolutely believe that all rooms should be single rooms," Ruth says, as are almost all rooms at the Jewish Home, as the nursing facility on the campus is known. Currently, many nursing homes house residents two or three or even four to a room, all sharing one bathroom, making it easier for infections to spread. Change the inspection system One way to improve residents' quality of life, Grabowski says, would be revamping the inspection system. "Unfortunately, we've been much more about identifying problems than we have been about working with facilities to help solve those problems," he says. Right now, inspection is handled by one state bureaucracy and quality improvement by another.  He'd like to see them combined. "Imagine I'm a surveyor right now, going into a nursing home to look at their infection control. If I see a problem with the way the staff is using the personal protective equipment," Grabowski says, "I can write that down on a sheet of paper and take that back and say there were problems. [Or] I could help them immediately start to fix that." AHCA President Mark Parkinson agrees that "the survey system is broken." In a conference call last month with reporters, Parkinson said that it "focuses on too many things," making it hard to prioritize. He calls the system "punitive" and "combative." Parkinson says he hopes to sit down with stakeholders when the pandemic is over "and figure out a better way." Professor Charlene Harrington of the University of California, San Francisco, says a "better way" would be to refocus the inspection system on the fundamental problem of nursing homes, which she says is inadequate staffing. Nursing assistants, she says, are "running from one resident to the other without hand washing," which she says is one of the main reasons that nursing homes are so often cited for poor infection control. So many of the citations that nursing homes receive — from poor infection control, to patients with bed sores, to nutrition problems — can all be traced back to insufficient staff, says Harrington, but it's something they're almost never cited for directly. Harrington blames nursing home owners for the low staff levels. "Over 70% of nursing homes are for-profit," she says, contending they reduce staff to lower their costs. "That's the primary way that for-profit companies can save money." But Grabowski thinks the major reason that nursing homes don't have enough staff is Medicaid. It pays the bills for most nursing home residents, but it doesn't pay much. Nursing homes can barely break even on a Medicaid resident. "There's under-investment in care generally and in staff in particular," Grabowski says. "And why can't we pay more for these services and value the people that provide care for all of us in these settings? You know, we're getting what we pay for right now. And it's unfortunately not a very good outcome." Re-think ownership There might be better outcomes if most nursing homes weren't designed to make money, says Daniel Ruth of the Jewish Home.   "If I was the king of the world, there would be a much greater proportion of nursing homes run by not-for-profits." Ruth says the Jewish Home's nonprofit status made it easier for him to do something that other facilities have struggled with during the pandemic. Under a directive from the state of California for all nursing facilities, the Jewish Home began accepting COVID-positive patients discharged from hospitals. That was in early April. Since then, none of its prior residents have been infected, nor have any of its staff taking care of the new COVID-positive patients. Ruth says that he was not only able to devote a separate wing of the facility to care for the COVID-positive patients and give them a dedicated staff, he was also able to take rooms that might ordinarily be filled with residents and convert them to spaces for the staff to relax, shower, and do laundry, which also protect them from infection. "We took beds out of service, we took dollars away from the income statement," Ruth says. "We obviously knew what the economic impact of doing that would be, but we felt [it was] part of our mission and values." Ruth says he doesn't believe that a for-profit nursing home would have made the same choice. Professor Charlene Harrington of UCSF agrees. "The financial interests of for-profit nursing homes are too often in conflict with their mission to care for older adults," Harrington says. And the only way to fundamentally change that is to change the ownership structure, she says, regulating them like a utility. "You would have very tough financial requirements, you would have stricter requirements of who could become an owner. Only owners with good track records would be allowed," Harrington says. "And you would have very strict standards around their staffing and the way they pay their staff and treat their staff." People never picture themselves in a nursing home, Harrington says. But they should. And they should think about what they would like for themselves. "Until we start doing that," she says, "we're going to allow them to continue to operate on a sub-par level." Get creative  A nursing home is "basically considered ... a place you send people when you don't really know what else to do with them," Louise Aronson says. As a society, we would never put up with the state of nursing homes today if it weren't for our general disregard of older people, Aronson says. "We imagine older people to be of very little value. So it's kind of like time served as a human being. All those years you spent working and raising your family, they eventually become worth nothing." To show respect for older adults, Aronson would like to see nursing homes be more like actual homes, stylish and stimulating, rather than soulless, institutional corridors of plastic and stainless steel. "So your room would look like a place somebody actually wants to live, not like a cell or a hospital room," she says. "You would have access to outdoor activities. There would be, you know, plants and animals and lots of visitors and music and activities that were easy to get to." Nursing homes could even be incubators for design that would help everyone, says Aronson. She envisions the creation of "really great looking showers that somebody can roll [a wheel chair] into." Or cool looking walkers or beds that move up and down. "Because the stuff that will work in these modern nursing homes will work in all our [own] homes, too." And that would make our homes age-friendly, Aronson says. We might be able to put off moving to a nursing home for a long time. And we might be a lot happier if some day the nursing home is also our home.
                If workers and businesses stick with telecommuting for the long term it could affect energy use beyond the current pandemic.

             If workers and businesses stick with telecommuting for the long term it could affect energy use beyond the current pandemic. With businesses closed and people at home the country is using a lot less energy and emitting fewer of the greenhouse gases that warm the climate. The big question is whether any of these energy-saving habits we're developing now will stick as daily life starts to return to normal. U.S. energy-related carbon dioxide emissions are projected to decrease an extraordinary 11% this year, according to the Energy Information Administration's May Short-Term Energy Outlook. But that may not last long. The agency projects emissions will rise again by 5% next year as stay-at-home orders are lifted and the economy begins to recover. There's a lot of uncertainty in those projections because there are a lot of unknowns that will depend on hundreds of millions of decisions by individuals like Lee Carpenter. "We've been a one-car household as long as my wife and I have been together, and we've been together for 20 years," Carpenter says. But that's about to change because of COVID-19. Carpenter lives in Philadelphia and tries to make environmentally-friendly decisions. She and her wife chose a house close to a rail line so Carpenter could take public transportation to Temple University, where she's a law professor. "I'm not sure that I'll feel comfortable or safe taking mass transit for the foreseeable future, unfortunately," she says. And the rail line is shut down now because of the pandemic, so she's decided to buy a second car. Carpenter figures her carbon footprint is still less than before since the family canceled several cross-country airplane trips. Asked how her energy consumption might change as life returns to normal, her guess is as good as anyone's. "Right now I think I'm doing the same thing that everyone is doing, which is really finding myself with an inability to project out what I'll be doing more than about three weeks into the future," says Carpenter.  Loading...  Don't see the graphic above? Click here. A big part of our energy use is habits — how we commute, when we turn on the heat or air conditioning, and how often we go to the store. We're all changing those habits now. Transportation experts are watching for clues to determine what will be the broader effects of all this change. Late summer and early fall could be an important period to learn what new habits people might adopt. "The first metric is when schools open, when children leave the homes or the parents have the option of sending the kids to school," says Anurag Komanduri with the transportation consulting firm Cambridge Systematics. Komanduri also is interested in whether mass transit agencies are able to convince riders that measures like wearing masks and cleaning buses will keep them safe. And there's the big question of when companies will start to recall employees who are working at home now. Already Americans are driving more as local officials relax stay-at-home orders. Still, changes in how people commute could also save energy. "We waste billions of gallons of fuel every year, for example, in traffic commuting, everybody at the same time," says Amy Myers Jaffe, an energy expert at the Council on Foreign Relations. She says now that some employees have learned they can successfully do some work from home, they may choose to stop sitting in traffic at rush hour – maybe take that first morning meeting over video conference. "We could come in at a staggered way and not waste fuel," Jaffe says. Twitter, for one, says some employees are welcome to give up commuting for good and work from home. Some Google and Facebook employees will work from home through the end of the year. Jaffe also says more people are shopping online and using delivery services now. If that sticks it could lead to lower energy consumption because companies like UPS use navigation and computers to determine efficient routes. "In 2017 when UPS put in that system they saved 100 million miles of vehicle travel," Jaffe says. The company says that saved about 10 million gallons of fuel, and the emissions they produce. To be sure, the pandemic's impact on greenhouse gas emissions will not be nearly enough to address the warming climate. The U.N. has said emissions need to be cut 7.6% every year for the next decade to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, the goal of the Paris climate agreement. Still, this unprecedented period of experimentation could lead to lasting changes that help that effort. We'll find out in coming months.

             A portion of the letter that President Trump addressed to World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, posted late Monday night on Twitter in the midst of WHO's annual assembly. As the world seeks to join together to bring the novel coronavirus under control, President Trump has sent a letter to the World Health Organization threatening that the U.S. will halt all funding and consider leaving the agency, pending an assessment of its response to COVID-19. The timing of the letter added to its shock value: Trump sent out a tweet at 10:55 p.m. Monday, in the midst of WHO's annual assembly, announcing that he'd sent the letter. The tweet included the letter's full text and stated that his allegations of incompetence on the part of WHO were "self-explanatory." WHO responded cautiously: "We have of course received the letter, and we are looking into it," Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of WHO, said at a press conference Wednesday. Pressed by NPR on what exactly the Trump administration is asking for in terms of changes at WHO to keep the U.S. from leaving the organization, Michael Ryan, executive director of WHO's Health Emergencies Program, said, "I think you might want to point that question to them." Other global health researchers were more direct.  "I found the letter full of unsubstantiated interpretations of certain events," said Kelley Lee, a global health professor at Simon Fraser University. A U.S. withdrawal from WHO would seriously compromise efforts to unite and provide proper funding for a global response in a "profoundly important moment," Lee said.  NPR spoke to global health experts in the U.S., Canada and Switzerland and examined the public record to provide context for some of the assertions in Trump's letter (reprinted in bold below). The full text of the letter can be read at the end of this post. "The International Health Regulations require countries to report the risk of a health emergency within 24 hours. But China did not inform the World Health Organization of Wuhan's several cases of pneumonia, of unknown origin, until December 31, 2019, even though it likely had knowledge of these cases days or weeks earlier. "Even now, China continues to undermine the International Health Regulations by refusing to share accurate and timely data, viral samples and isolates, and by withholding vital information about the virus and its origins. And, to this day, China continues to deny international access to their scientists and relevant facilities, all while casting blame widely and recklessly and censoring its own experts." China's delays in providing information and lack of sharing are what Lawrence Gostin, a global health professor at Georgetown University Law Center, calls  "two truths in the president's letter." First, Gostin said China was not transparent early on in the outbreak. "China was anywhere from two to even up to six weeks' late in reporting to the World Health Organization," Gostin said, noting there's evidence that Chinese health authorities knew the coronavirus was circulating in December and that their delays in reporting likely "seeded the epidemic" through East Asia, Europe and the United States. Second, while China quickly shared the genome sequence for the coronavirus, "it has not been as forthcoming with sharing biological samples which are needed for epidemiology and also for vaccines and treatments," Gostin said.  But Gostin said blaming WHO for China's reporting delays and sample hoarding is misdirected. Of these charges by Trump, he said: "They're valid critiques of China but not the World Health Organization. "The World Health Organization consistently ignored credible reports of the virus spreading in Wuhan in early December 2019 or even earlier, including reports from the Lancet medical journal. The World Health Organization failed to independently investigate credible reports that conflicted directly with the Chinese government's official accounts, even those that came from sources within Wuhan itself." The Lancet, a respected medical journal, said: "This statement is factually incorrect." In a note shared on Twitter, the journal said it published its first papers on the novel coronavirus on Jan. 24. In two papers published that day, researchers from China and Hong Kong described the first 41 patients in Wuhan and provided scientific evidence for human-to-human transmission.  WHO also disagrees with the charge that information relevant to the coronavirus was reported in early December. WHO said its representatives first learned of a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown cause in Wuhan on Dec. 31 through the agency's epidemic surveillance system, which gathers reports and rumors of outbreaks.  "There are literally millions and millions of cases of atypical pneumonia around the world every year, and in the middle of an influenza season sometimes it's very difficult to pick out a signal of a cluster of cases," WHO's Ryan said at a press conference April 15. "In fact it's quite remarkable that such a cluster was ultimately picked out of 41 confirmed cases in Wuhan." "By [Dec. 31], Taiwanese authorities had communicated information to the World Health Organization indicating human-to-human transmission of a new virus. Yet the World Health Organization chose not to share any of this critical information with the rest of the world, probably for political reasons." WHO has repeatedly said this assertion is false. Taiwan's health authorities also said they did not officially report to WHO that human-to-human transmission was happening by Dec. 31. Taiwan's Ministry of Health and Welfare shared the email its Centers for Disease Control sent to WHO on Dec. 31: "News resources today indicate that at least seven atypical pneumonia cases were reported in Wuhan, CHINA. Their health authorities replied to the media that the cases were believed not SARS; however, the samples are still under examination, and cases have been isolated for treatment. I would greatly appreciate it if you have relevant information to share with us. Thank you very much in advance for your attention to this matter." Tedros said this note from Taiwan made no direct references to human-to-human transmission and simply requested clarification on reports Taiwan's health officials were seeing about a pneumonia cluster from China. "On January 28, 2020, after meeting with President Xi [Jinping] in Beijing, [Tedros] praised the Chinese government for its 'transparency' with respect to the coronavirus, announcing that China had set a 'new standard for outbreak control' and 'bought the world time.' You did not mention that China had, by then, silenced or punished several doctors for speaking out about the virus and restricted Chinese institutions from publishing information about it."  The World Health Organization did praise China at that point. "The United States was equally praising China at the time," Georgetown Law's Gostin pointed out. On Jan. 24, Trump tweeted: "China has been working very hard to contain the Coronavirus. The United States greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency. It will all work out well. In particular, on behalf of the American People, I want to thank President Xi!" "The only way forward for the World Health Organization is if it can actually demonstrate independence from China. My Administration has already started discussions with you on how to reform the organization. But action is needed quickly." This demand comes with no specifics,  global health observers said. "What exactly does the Trump administration want WHO to do?" Simon Fraser's Lee asked. It's not clear what "action" the U.S. is asking for, or how WHO could demonstrate "independence from China," because no solutions are outlined in the letter.  As for the threat of U.S. withdrawal, Gostin said he thinks the U.S. is unlikely to follow through with leaving WHO, because he does not believe Congress would approve such a move. Still, Trump's threats are already causing substantial damage to the global agency tasked with coordinating the world's response to the pandemic, said Benjamin Mason Meier, associate professor of global health policy at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. "For the United States to blame the World Health Organization for its own months and months and months of inaction seems factually untrue and designed to divide the world at a moment when global solidarity is needed most," Meier said. "It undercuts the World Health Organization's efforts to provide a collective response to this common threat [of the COVID-19 pandemic]." Jason Beaubien and Pranav Baskar contributed to this story.

             Shoppers wear masks at Eastern Market in Washington, D.C., on May 17. An NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll finds that most Americans think it will take at least six months to return to normal daily life. Two-thirds of Americans do not expect their daily lives to return to normal for at least six months, and as states reopen, three-quarters are concerned that a second wave of coronavirus cases will emerge, a new NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll finds. "There's a great sense that normalcy is not around the corner," said Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist Institute for Public Opinion, which conducted the poll. He pointed out that with states reopening — some outside federal guidelines for doing so — there's "a real disconnect between public opinion and public policy." Since the coronavirus pandemic hit, Americans have also grown more wary of voting in person. Half of them now say they would vote by mail if it's allowed by their state, according to the poll. About a quarter of Americans voted by mail in the 2016 general election, Miringoff noted. On Wednesday, Trump took aim at Michigan and Nevada for taking steps toward increasing voting by mail in this year's elections. The president accused them of potentially trying to engage in voter fraud, falsely claiming that ballot applications were sent illegally. (Trump deleted an earlier tweet that accused Michigan of sending actual absentee ballots.) He also threatened to put a hold on coronavirus relief funds to both states. It's not clear if the president has the authority to stop those funds; states run elections, not the federal government. Michigan sends absentee ballot applications to 7.7 million people ahead of Primaries and the General Election. This was done illegally and without authorization by a rogue Secretary of State. I will ask to hold up funding to Michigan if they want to go down this Voter Fraud path! Clearly, how to respond to the coronavirus crisis has become political. Wide political splits have emerged even in regards to when people expect life to return to normal, how worried they are about a new outbreak and whether to vote by mail. When will we return to normal?  While a majority of Republicans (55%) agree that they don't expect life to return to normal for at least six months and 57% are concerned about a second coronavirus wave, they are more optimistic that life will return to normal sooner and less worried about a second outbreak than Democrats and independents are.  Loading...  Don't see the graphic above? Click here. Overall, 65% of Americans polled said they don't expect life to return to normal for at least six months, including 78% of Democrats and 68% of independents. The most pessimistic about when life will return to normal — not for at least six months — were Democrats; African Americans (75%); college graduates (70%); white women with a college degree (70%); and Gen Xers, those 39 to 54 years old (70%). The most likely to say less than six months were Republicans and Latinos (both 42%). The coronavirus is disproportionately affecting black and Latino communities, both in terms of hospitalization rates and in job losses. Wide concerns about a second outbreak As for being concerned about a second outbreak, 77% of Americans polled said they are concerned or very concerned about one, including 93% of Democrats and 76% of independents. "The overwhelming majority feel we're in no way out of the woods," Miringoff said. "The notion that there's the potential or likelihood of a second wave is strong, and we see that clearly across party lines."  Loading...  Don't see the graphic above? Click here. The most concerned were Democrats, African Americans (86%), women (83%) and Latinos (81%), even though Latinos were more optimistic than Democrats or African Americans about when life would get back to normal. Less likely to be concerned were Republicans (57%); white men without a college degree (68%); those in the Silent or Greatest generations, over age 73 (69%); those who live in rural areas (69%); and men generally (70%). Big vote-by-mail splits. Who won't be voting? And there's a divide on voting by mail: A majority of Republicans (56%) would rather cast their ballots in person than by mail (42%), whereas 61% of Democrats and 53% of independents prefer voting by mail this November.  Loading...  Don't see the graphic above? Click here. The most likely to want to vote by mail were white women with a college degree (64%), whites with a college degree (62%), those who live in the West (62%) and Democrats (61%). Western states have been voting by mail for many election cycles. Among those most likely to say they want to vote in person are Republicans (56%), those in the South (45%), white women without a college degree (44%), those 45 and older (44%), whites (42%) and people without a college degree (40%). Some 10% say they do not intend to vote, which the pollsters indicate is about what would be expected, but the groups with the highest percentages of members who say they won't vote cut across key pillars in both parties: Gen Z and millennials, ages 18 to 38 (19%); Latinos (16%); suburban men (13%); those without a college degree (13%); white men without a degree (12%); and African Americans (11%). The survey of 1,007 adults was conducted by The Marist Poll via landline and cell phone from May 12 to 17. Data collection and weighting was provided by SSRS. The poll has a margin of error of +/- 3.6 percentage points.

             Detroit faces a $350 million deficit and is cutting city workers' pay. The coronavirus has taken a hatchet to municipal budgets everywhere, forcing cities and towns to lay off librarians, parks workers and even first responders like police and firefighters. From big cities like Detroit to small towns like Ogdensburg, N.Y., workers are being furloughed, programs are being cut and major capital projects are being shelved. Houston, which has been hard hit by the drop in oil prices, is grappling with a sharp drop-off in sales tax and fee revenue that has left the city with a deficit of almost $170 million. "This virus has had a much deeper adverse impact on the city of Houston than Harvey did, when more rain fell on this city than any other city in the history of the country," says Mayor Sylvester Turner.

Turner recently proposed a budget that would temporarily furlough all city employees except for police, firefighters and solid waste department employees and delay incoming police cadet classes. Nationwide, almost a million government workers were laid off in April alone, according to the Labor Department, and the numbers are almost certain to climb, as sales and income tax revenue dwindles. "We will see an intense drop-off in sales tax and especially in your income tax collection between now and November, December and certainly we're looking two years out," says Emily Swenson Brock, director of the Federal Liaison Center at the Government Finance Officers Association. While many cities have tried to spare first responders from job cuts, the International Association of Fire Chiefs says nearly 1,000 firefighters have been laid off and projects that 30,000 positions could eventually be affected. The downturn for cities has been as sudden as it is severe: Big cities like these have been able to tap into an unprecedented amount of federal aid, including a $500 billion short-term lending facility created by the Federal Reserve, and $150 billion in money from Congress, under the CARES Act. Smaller cities aren't eligible for the programs, unless their states choose to pass on some of the money to them, Brock says. With restaurants and stores closed, Newport News, Va., has seen a sharp drop-off in sales tax revenue and has had to cancel big capital projects like the construction of a downtown parking garage. "You know we can't jeopardize our safety services like a fire and police, so we have to make sure those things are in the forefront before we look at projects on the wish list," says Mayor McKinley Price. Projects like these are meant to help lure businesses into the city, and canceling them could hurt the city's economy long-term, he says. "So it's kind of a domino effect when you start seeing things like that decrease," Price says.

             Anthony Reyes, a police officer with the City of Miami, shows the results of his coronavirus antibody test at the Hard Rock Stadium testing site in Miami Gardens, Fla., in early May. Last month the White House issued guidelines suggesting a way to reduce the number of false positive results in antibody tests: Run two tests. But that strategy has not yet been validated for coronavirus testing. And the details matter. Antibody tests identify people who have been previously exposed to the coronavirus. But false positives are a big concern. A test that has a 99% specificity is still wrong 1% of the time. And if it's being used to test a population where 1% of people are infected, half the time a positive result will be a false positive.  This phenomenon may help explain why researchers from Stanford University reported a high rate of coronavirus infection in California's Santa Clara County – vastly more than would be expected based on known diagnoses. That problem concerned entrepreneur Michael Wohl, as he set about starting a business to provide quick and reliable testing for coronavirus. "I started doing the math of what can be done and figured out that we could do a second test," says Wohl, who directs a program at the University of Rochester's business school to teach entrepreneurship.  Loading...  The two-test system would cost more. Wohl says he's seen antibody tests priced from $30 to $100 or more. But theoretically at least, the approach could dramatically improve the outcome — provided, that is, that the second test is distinctly different from the first one, so it's not making the same error. "When I came up with this idea, I put together a PowerPoint and sent it to the governor's office in New York and the health department. And it propagated between various government agencies," he says. He got a lot of positive feedback and was excited to see the concept embraced by the White House at the end of April. But the White House testing guidelines have an important omission. The guidelines just say test twice, but they don't say to use two different tests. "One can infer, actually if you look at the guidelines that it's the same test given twice. But it's critical that the two tests are uncorrelated," Wohl says. When a person is infected, the immune system produces multiple antibodies, targeted to attach to various features on the coronavirus. Wohl says this double-testing method should look for two different antibodies, targeting two different regions of the virus. And there's another shortcoming of the White House guidelines. Nobody seems to have conducted real-world tests to see if the concept actually works for the coronavirus. So Wohl looked up a cousin at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill and asked him to see about gathering evidence for this idea. The cousin, physician-researcher David Wohl, in turn got his colleague John Schmitz, interested in the question. "This is really modeling off what we do for a variety of other tests in our lab, like HIV testing," says Schmitz, who is a pathology professor and lab director at UNC. A positive antibody test for HIV is routinely confirmed with a different kind of test, because a false diagnosis can have huge consequences. So, while the concept is sound, Schmitz wants to see evidence. He's starting to run his own tests. One hypothetical worry is that some common factor could cause two tests to both provide false results. "In most cases, we don't know what causes a false positive, to be honest with you," Schmitz says. Sometimes people with autoimmune disease produce antibodies that trigger false positives in tests like this. Some antibodies that target similar viruses can also create a false signal. And laboratory processes can also contribute. "Given the pervasive talk in the field — in the lay field even — you hear about false positives, false positive, I thought we ought to look at this to get around that problem as best we can," he says. He figures it will take a couple of months to get results from his study of the issue. That thought has also occurred to a group at the University of California, San Francisco and UC Berkeley. They have been running careful comparisons of some of the many antibody tests to measure the performance of those that are already out on the market. Dr. Alex Marson at UCSF says they may be able to take the data they've already gathered and reanalyze it quickly, to see if different tests produce a different pattern of false positives, as would be needed for the two-test strategy. He's also thinking about broader questions, such as when it would make sense to spend the money on two tests, as opposed to running a single slower but highly accurate test in a lab.  Part of the appeal of the two-test strategy is it can use handy tests that are like an early-pregnancy test. These are called lateral-flow tests and require just a drop of blood and can provide results in minutes.  Another approach would be to use a much more sophisticated test called an ELISA test to look for antibodies.  (ELISA stands for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay). These tests need to be run in a sophisticated lab, but some are highly precise. Marson says, depending on the circumstances, it might make sense to run one of these highly accurate tests than running two with lower performance – or perhaps using the disposable test to screen a poplulation and then follow up with the ELISA. But getting accurate test results only solves one of two major questions around antibody testing. The other is knowing what a positive result really means. "If you know there are antibodies in your blood, are you safe from future infections?" Marson asks. "That we do not know the answer to." Antibodies do signal that someone has been infected with the coronavirus. But it's not clear yet whether that exposure means people are in fact immune, and if so for how long. Evidence is starting to accumulate that there is at least passing immunity, but scientists would like stronger evidence before they deem these tests trustworthy. Even if antibodies don't indicate immunity, because they are markers of exposure, they are still useful for studying the spread of coronavirus throughout the population. But the results would not provide actionable information to individuals. You can contact NPR Science Correspondent Richard Harris at rharris@npr.org.

             Freeways in Oakland, as in much of California, saw much lighter traffic — and fewer fatal traffic collisions — in the early weeks of the pandemic's stay-at-home rules. On Day 2 of the San Francisco Bay Area's stay-at-home orders in March, Nohemi Jimenez got into her car in San Pablo, Calif., waved goodbye to her 3-year-old son and drove to her regular Wednesday dialysis appointment. The roads were deserted. No traffic. Jimenez says it is hard to admit what she thought next: No traffic meant no car crashes. And that meant she'd be on the waiting list for a kidney transplant even longer. "I don't want to be mean, but I was like, 'Oh, my God. Nobody's going to die,'" she says. "I'm not going to get my transplant." Jimenez, who is now 30 years old, was 20 and pregnant with her first child when doctors discovered she had been born with only one kidney, and that lone kidney was failing. By age 29, doctors told her she needed a new one. It was strange and scary, she says, waiting for someone to die so she could live. "You're just thinking about it," she says. "It's sitting in your mind. It just can never leave you alone." Deaths from motor vehicle crashes and fatal injuries are the biggest source of organs for transplant, accounting for 33% of donations, according to the United Network for Organ Sharing, which manages the nation's organ transplant system.

             But ever since the coronavirus forced Californians indoors, those accidents have declined. Traffic collisions and fatalities in the state dropped by half in the first three weeks of shelter-in-place restrictions, according to a study by the University of California, Davis. Drowning deaths dropped 80% in California, according to data compiled by the nonprofit Stop Drowning Now. In April, organ procurement organizations typically see a surge in donations related to outdoor, spring break-related activities and travel, but not this year. From March 8 to April 11, the number of organ donors who died in traffic collisions was down 23% nationwide compared with the same period last year, while donors who died in all other types of accidents were down 21%, according to data from UNOS. "Spring break accidents are almost nonexistent because there's no spring break — beach accidents, motorcycle accidents, hunting accidents," says Janice Whaley, CEO of Donor Network West, which manages organ donations for Northern California and Nevada. Doctors say they've also noticed a decline in emergency room visits overall, not just for accidents, and this may also be limiting the supply of donor organs. "Where are all the people with heart attacks? Where are all the people with strokes?" says George Rutherford, a professor and infectious disease physician at the University of California, San Francisco. "Are those patients staying away from the ERs for fear of COVID? Clearly, the census is way down in ERs." At Kaiser Permanente medical centers in Northern California, where 4.4 million patients get care, weekly hospital admissions for heart attacks have dropped almost 50% since the region's first COVID-19 death was reported in early March. Strokes and heart attacks are the second and third most common sources of organ donations, accounting for 27% and 20% of organs, respectively, according to UNOS. When people die from a stroke or heart attack at home instead of a hospital, their organs cannot be used for transplant because of lost blood flow. Most organ donations occur after a person suffers a near-fatal event and lifesaving measures do not work. For organs to be viable, people must die or be declared brain-dead while on a ventilator, so blood keeps pumping to the heart, lungs, liver and kidneys. COVID preparations slow transplant pipeline A range of other logistical complications have made transplants difficult during the coronavirus pandemic. Hospitals have had to scale back surgeries of all kinds to preserve scarce supplies of personal protective equipment and ventilators. And many haven't had the bandwidth to manage the delicate timing and complexity of organ donation, recovery, transportation and transplantation. Transplant surgeries across the country plummeted 52% from March 8 to April 11, according to UNOS data. "There are a lot of things that have to happen perfectly, and now we're in an imperfect situation where we're trying to deal with so many other things," Whaley says. Earlier in the pandemic, as medical centers braced for a wave of COVID-19 patients, they wanted to free up as many ventilators as possible. In addition to donors needing to die on ventilators to keep their organs viable, doctors often keep them on ventilators for two or three days while transplant teams and recipients are lined up. Then the recipients need to be on ventilators during surgery. "People were very antsy about having non-COVID-19 patients on ventilators, taking up space," Whaley says. "They wanted to make sure they were ready for that next patient." Many COVID patients who died had previously signed up to have their organs donated for transplantation upon death; but those organs were declined, out of concern that recipients could become infected, Whaley says. Testing shortage meant some organs wasted And a shortage of coronavirus testing supplies made it difficult for transplant centers to test potential donors who later died of other causes to make sure they were not infected with the virus. "So there may have been some organ turndowns that we normally wouldn't have seen," says Dr. Chris Freise, a professor and transplant surgeon at UCSF. As a matter of policy, hospitals canceled virtually all organ transplants from living donors — procedures that involve a family member or someone else donating a kidney or section of their liver. "That involves bringing two patients into the hospital — the donor and the recipient — and we certainly didn't want to put donors at any significant extra risk," Freise says. "Living-donor kidney transplants ground down to almost a complete halt in most programs across the country." Some hospitals began doing living donations again in early May, while donations from deceased donors started to increase slowly in mid-April. That's when Jimenez got her call from Freise's team at UCSF. A condition related to Jimenez's three pregnancies made finding a donor match for her exceptionally difficult, Freise says — "like a needle in a haystack." That also put her at the top of the waiting list in case a match was found. On April 17, Jimenez's phone rang at 2 a.m. A transplant staffer told her to get to the hospital right away. "I was excited," Jimenez says. "But then my mind hit me: Somebody died." All she knows is that the donor was 19 and died in an accident in Los Angeles. Jimenez wrote a letter to the donor's family. "I told them that I will forever be thinking of them," she says. "I will have him or her in my body for the rest of my life, and I will live for both of us." Jimenez has six months of recovery ahead of her. She says she's looking forward to going back to work and having more energy to play with her kids.

             An engineer works in April on an experimental COVID-19 vaccine at Sinovac Biotech's facilities in Beijing. Sinovac Biotech is conducting one of four clinical trials that have been authorized in China. The race for a coronavirus vaccine is on. This week, Massachusetts-based Moderna Inc. reported promising preliminary results for the vaccine it is developing. It's one of eight vaccines under development that have been approved for clinical trials, according to the World Health Organization. Half of those vaccines are being developed in China, where the outbreak first emerged. The Chinese government has fast-tracked promising projects and has poured money and resources into the effort to find a vaccine. Experts say the ruling Communist Party recognizes that much more is at stake than public health. One of the biggest concerns is the economy, says Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations. "There's a strong incentive to reopen the economy, right, to have business back to normal," he says. The party's legitimacy has long depended on a strong economy. Before the pandemic, the government was targeting 6% growth in the gross domestic product this year. In the first quarter, the economy shrank by nearly 7%. "The vaccines would be, indeed, a silver bullet," says Huang. A homegrown inoculation would serve another purpose for the government, observers say: deflecting heat. Beijing has been beset by criticism for its early handling of the outbreak and has faced a growing chorus of calls from other governments for an investigation into the origins of the disease, which first emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan. Chinese President Xi Jinping told the WHO's annual meeting on Monday that China had acted with "openness, transparency and responsibility" and said China supported the idea of a "comprehensive review" of the global response. Zuoyue Wang, a history professor at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona, says a Chinese-made vaccine could help undercut some of the criticism. "If a Chinese scientist could come up with a workable vaccine, I think it will help to defuse that kind of blaming or call for, you know, even reparation," he says. "There is pressure, enormous pressure, I think, for Chinese scientists to come up with an efficient or workable vaccine for the coronavirus pandemic." And if China won the race to develop the first COVID-19 vaccine, the propaganda value would be huge. Officials in Beijing have disparaged Western responses to the disease and have tried to make the case that China's authoritarian political system is superior — especially in the face of a crisis like this one. Xi on Monday pledged to share any vaccine with the rest of the world. William Lee, chief economist at the Milken Institute, which is tracking global vaccine projects, says Beijing is targeting developing countries and territories linked to the Belt and Road Initiative, China's signature global infrastructure drive. "A success story with a COVID vaccine would be such a marvelous cherry to put on that picture," Lee says. "They're incentivized to develop the vaccine as quickly as possible and distribute it as widely as they can among their Belt and Road countries in order to gain and expand China's dominance within that sphere. And also almost as a way of saying, 'The Western economic models have failed to develop it as quickly as we have.' " Before the pandemic, China was already investing heavily in areas like pharmaceuticals and biotechnology, in pursuit of ambitious plans to become a world leader across a range of sectors. According to government statistics, research and development spending in science and technology last year was more than $300 billion, about 24 times what it was two decades ago. In the hunt for a COVID-19 vaccine, the Ministry of Science and Technology is funding many of the trials. China has become the world's second-biggest pharmaceutical market, but breakneck growth has led to quality-related scandals. In the latest, in 2018, the Changchun Changsheng Life Sciences drug company was found to have faked production records for a rabies vaccine and sold more than 250,000 doses of a vaccine for infants that didn't meet medical standards. The case infuriated consumers, and a poll at the time showed that domestic confidence in Chinese vaccines slumped. Among China's COVID-19 vaccine efforts, one of the furthest along is a collaboration between a military medical institute and a private biotech company, CanSino Biologics. The virologist running the program is Chen Wei, a People's Liberation Army general. She has become something of a national hero because of her efforts. She said on state TV in April that developing a vaccine relates to national security. "In some areas and on some issues, we must have scientific self-confidence. With more than a billion people, we can't rely on others. We must rely on our own scientific strength to protect our people," she said. Going it alone can carry risks, though, says Lawrence Gostin, an expert on public health law at Georgetown University who advises the WHO. "Instead of having a complete, coordinated international response the way scientists want," he says, "this is almost becoming a race to the moon." In the long run, winning the race may not amount to much, at least from a commercial standpoint. "The irony is being the first is actually a bit of a curse," says Peter Hotez, co-director of the Texas Children's Hospital Center for Vaccine Development, which is working on a COVID-19 vaccine of its own. "If you look at the major vaccines used in the U.S., the ones that are in use generally were not the first out on the market," he says. "They got replaced over time."

             Two men duck for cover as waves generated by Cyclone Amphan smash against a breakwater Tuesday in Chennai, India. Farther north along India's east coast, near the country's border with Bangladesh, officials are struggling to evacuate areas in the storm's path. A storm of massive proportions has thumped the coastal border regions of India and Bangladesh, slinging heavy rains and gusts exceeding 100 mph when it made landfall. After days of churning in the Bay of Bengal, Cyclone Amphan came ashore Wednesday afternoon local time on the northeastern coast of India with the strength of a Category 2 hurricane. The cyclone has diminished in strength since its peak Monday, when its monster scale briefly earned the India Meteorological Department's highest storm classification — an ominous distinction not seen in the region for more than two decades. But even in its weakened state, Amphan packed a wallop that has knocked out power and wrecked unstable structures along the coast. "These are the fisherman communities. They are the most vulnerable people — people living close to the sea," said Kirti Mishra, who works with Catholic Relief Services in her hometown of Bhubaneswar in the Indian state of Odisha.  "They have thatched or asbestos sheeting as roofs," she added. "We have observed that these get blown off or they collapse completely. The walls are made of mud. With the rains and everything, the wind blows the roof away and the walls collapse." The need to evacuate areas in the storm's path has complicated the official response to still another catastrophe unfolding in both countries: the coronavirus pandemic. The same day the cyclone made landfall, India reported its highest single-day rise in confirmed cases, bringing its total tally north of 106,000. Bangladesh has reported more than 26,000.

             A man protects himself from the driving rain with a plastic sheet Wednesday in the eastern Indian state of Odisha. Officials in India and Bangladesh moved more than 2 million people into shelters as Cyclone Amphan bore down on the border regions. Between both countries, officials managed to evacuate the coastal regions of some 3 million people. But their efforts have met some significant roadblocks. "There was some resistance for the evacuation effort because of the fear of COVID-19," Mishra explained. "But late last evening people realized they need to be safe, and therefore they started moving voluntarily into the cyclone shelters." In Bangladesh, government officials were able to move less than half the 5 million people they had intended to place in shelters before the storm's arrival, according to Kaiser Rejve, who works as humanitarian and resilience director for the international aid group CARE. He said they are hoping to place the rest in more secure shelters by the end of Wednesday. "A lot of stress is already ongoing. You know, the last two months, during the lockdown situation, poor people have already been hard hit. Their income is reduced," Rejve said from the capital, Dhaka. Because their homes often hold what little they have left, Rejve explained, "they fear it will be lost if they move away from their homes." What's more, it's also Ramadan, during which Muslims observing the holiday do not eat or drink during daylight hours. Bangladesh is a majority-Muslim country, and many people are fasting. Meanwhile, there are also fears that a storm surge as large as the one caused by Amphan — which could rise as high as 16 feet in some areas — could bust through levees and poison their water supply.

             Residents gingerly tread a flooded street on their way to a shelter Wednesday in the border city of Khulna, Bangladesh. Amphan also poses acute dangers for migrants living in Bangladesh's large resettlement camps — including those in the city of Cox's Bazar, the temporary home to hundreds of thousands of Rohingya refugees from neighboring Myanmar. In such camps, options for sturdy shelter are often limited. "At this moment, we're at red danger level 10 — the highest warning level for cyclones. Our volunteers are communicating that to refugees," Rejve said. "In the camp area, there are some strong houses, but the main message there is to stay in your house because there is no strong cyclone shelter there."  Even where there are shelters to scramble to, the idea of social distancing can make for a dicey proposition. Officials in India intend to fill the shelters — many of which were previously COVID-19 quarantine centers — only to half their usual capacity, and the people holing up inside are expected to cover their faces as best they can.  The storm is expected to continue its course north and trundle the brunt of its winds and rain into Bangladesh overnight local time.Twenty years ago, when I was living in Oakland, I started playing capoeira, the Afro-Brazilian martial art. And that's where I met someone who eventually became a good friend: Jessica de Lima-Moran. We spent a lot of time training together. I eventually stopped, but Jessica dedicated her life to capoeira—and even met her husband, Sean Moran, through the martial art. Now, they live in Los Angeles, and have worked with a nonprofit for the past 15 years spreading the art of capoeira. They teach youth of color at different community centers around Southern California, college students at universities, and adults at a gym not far from where they live. Jessica de Lima-Moran demonstrates the art of capoeira. On March 1, they took over that gym and signed an expensive five-year lease. But just two weeks later, they had to close their doors. California had just issued its stay-at-home order, requiring nonessential businesses to close. Jessica and Sean knew the measure was important for keeping their community safe — but they also knew it was likely to put their life's work in jeopardy. There are many reasons that small business owners of color—like Jessica de Lima-Moran, who's Brazilian, and her husband Sean Moran, who's black—will have to fight especially hard to survive the economic effects of COVID-19. So at the beginning of April, I asked them to start recording dispatches from their cell phones to document some of what they've been going through — including applying for loans, unemployment and relief money.

             Jessica de Lima-Moran and Sean Moran, practicing capoeira April 10 We have been on constant phone calls with our accountant. We are worried. I mean, what can we say? It's a little complicated, because you are told about options like the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) and Small Business Administration (SBA) loans, but then nobody responds. So it's just a waiting game. We are just completely in limbo. April 14:  We're still waiting on anything. Any stimulus money, any assistance, any help. Today, finally, we got an email from the SBA. Now, I'm on hold on the phone with them.  Their email was completely unhelpful. Basically, it's a recap of what the Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) loan does and the PPP does. I'm super frustrated.  April 16:  Yesterday, the sun came out, a break from the dreary rain that was happening. The beautiful sunshine is bookended by the news that every day, there's a change in whatever is happening. Yesterday, it was that the stimulus bill was going to run out of money for PPP and for the small business emergency loans. So now I'm assuming we have to wait for another stimulus bill. We're still waiting for our relief check.  The gym is the last thing that's going to open up. We were the first ones to close, and we're gonna be the last ones to open up. We're gonna still be wearing face masks until 2021. I can't believe that. For gyms and large gatherings of people sweating, I don't know when they're going to let us reconnect again. We're doing online classes with our students, but they're dropping off. With the money that we have coming in, we're not going to be able to pay two months of rent and utility and insurance when we reopen. That's over $13,000 of just rent. Commercial rent in Los Angeles is no joke, right?  I'm not going to give up on the dream, though. That's our space. That's our gym. This has been 15 years in the making, and it's not going to get taken away from us. I don't know what we're gonna do, but it is not gonna get taken away from us. I feel very strongly about that. April 21st: I'm currently emailing the Small Business Administration. I guess they're making some corrections, because large corporations somehow went through some loophole and got millions and millions of dollars of funding. I just heard on the radio about how this time, they are going to try to allocate some money for some different special groups, like minority businesses. So maybe we can push to some kind of front of the line. So I'm emailing the SBA, because we still haven't heard anything. I also don't see a stimulus check in my bank account. April 29: Nothing yet. No money, honey. We can't apply for unemployment either, because we are still finishing up a teaching gig at Cal Arts. That's only a partial supplementary income, but we don't want to lie. But still, it's just so complicated to fill out unemployment applications. Both Sean and I tried, and we don't want to lie. So no unemployment, no stimulus money, no PPP, no SBA, no microloan from the city of Los Angeles. April 30:  Now we're just even more panicked. We're supporters of public safety; public health is fundamental.That goes without saying. But Gov. Gavin Newsom is saying that gyms are in Phase Three of reopening, and that's months away. I mean, are you serious? Months? There's no way we're gonna be able to stay open.  To hear the rest of Jessica and Sean's story, listen to this week's episode of the podcast.

             Todd Olson's company, Twin City Die Castings, played a key role in an urgent project to help General Motors make ventilators for the coronavirus effort. One Friday in March, Todd Olson was suddenly pulled into a life-or-death project.  General Motors Co. asked Olson, CEO of Twin City Die Castings in Minneapolis: Could he help make tiny pistons? The giant carmaker was committed to helping the country by producing ventilators, which were suddenly in short supply as the coronavirus spread like wildfire. And GM needed lots of pistons for the kind of ventilator it would produce. Most importantly, the pistons had to come together fast. And that's how this small company in Minneapolis got drafted into a manufacturing effort unlike any since World War II. Olson was already bracing for a huge chunk of his regular business drying up because two of his largest customers, Ford Motor Co. and GM, announced they were stopping car production altogether.  FACES OF THE CORONAVIRUS RECESSION Jobs lost. Businesses in peril. Meetings gone virtual. Faces Of The Coronavirus Recession offers snapshots of working lives upended by the pandemic. So this request was fortuitous, even if it required the kind of planning his company had never done before. "Normally this would take about 12 weeks for us to get into production," he said. Olson's company is in the business of die casting, essentially pouring molten aluminum into custom molds to make larger car parts. So to make the kind of small pistons that GM needed would require different kinds of molds — smaller ones. So he called a different company that makes custom molds — Die-Tech & Engineering in the Grand Rapids, Mich., area The two manufacturers pulled in all of their engineers and ran their shops around the clock all weekend long. Some engineers designed the mold. Others ran computer simulations to find the optimal speed for pouring the molten aluminum. Months' worth of man-hours were condensed into a few days.  Soon the mold was in a van from Michigan to Minneapolis. Early Thursday morning, Olson went into his factory. A group of men stood around in hard hats and safety glasses, drinking coffee, as a machine operator hit a button. There was a loud sizzle, then a clank. And that was how the first piston parts were made for the ventilator project over one long weekend. "We've been in business a hundred years," Olson said. "And this might well be our biggest moment."

                Fresh asparagus has been gathered in Bottrop, Germany, in mid-April. Farms across Europe are facing a labor shortage as a result of closed borders because of the coronavirus pandemic.

             Fresh asparagus has been gathered in Bottrop, Germany, in mid-April. Farms across Europe are facing a labor shortage as a result of closed borders because of the coronavirus pandemic. Arne Garlipp has farmed his 150 acres of asparagus in the eastern German state of Saxony-Anhalt for 24 years. For much of that time, he has relied on seasonal workers to help harvest it each spring. "Our Romanian workers live with us on the farm," says Garlipp. "In the fields, they're surrounded by fresh air, birds and very few people." But when Germany closed its borders to slow the coronavirus outbreak, Garlipp and hundreds of thousands of other German farmers were suddenly in panic mode. Each year, 300,000 seasonal workers — mostly from Romania and Poland — come to Germany to harvest asparagus, lettuce, apples and other crops that Germans rely on. Germany's federal government has given special permission and offered air travel for 80,000 seasonal workers from Romania and Poland to enter Germany to harvest crops, but farmers say it won't be enough. "There will be an impact in the market, and we will see this later in the year, in the summer," says Udo Hemmerling, the deputy general secretary of the German Farmers' Association. It is a problem playing out in farms across Europe, as coronavirus restrictions disrupt work and supply chains, and risk leaving unpicked produce to rot. The situation is so dire that European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has urged member states to allow workers to come to their countries, treating fruit and vegetable pickers as essential. In Germany, developers have created a mobile app called Clever Ackern — German for "clever plowing" — to help fill the worker shortage on farms while also addressing unemployment in cities. "It's a platform where people, students, young people and people who just lost their jobs register and tell us their availability on the upcoming weeks and months to help farmers on their fields," app developer Fabian Höhne says. Before the coronavirus pandemic hit, Höhne ran a travel booking app that offered last-minute discounted airline tickets to students. With hardly anyone flying now, he and his staff shifted gears and came up with the program connecting farmers and potential workers. The service is free of charge. Within days of launching in March, 40,000 people registered to become farmworkers, the developer says. "I think the great weather, of course, is bringing people outside, and they're saying, 'OK, yeah, let's do something. Let's help,' " says Höhne. But farmer Garlipp is skeptical about the idea of city folks working in the fields, and he isn't convinced it is a good idea health-wise, either. "If I take on [Germans] to help with the harvest — assuming they're fit enough for the job — the problem I face is that they'll come from all over the region," Garlipp says. "I have no idea where these people have been or who they're mixing with at the end of the day, and the risk of [coronavirus] infection is much higher." Garlipp says he has received more than a hundred offers from Germans willing to help him on the farm, but it turns out he won't need their help. Thanks to the German government, his regular team of 80 Romanians are among those who will be allowed to bring in the harvest this year.

             People stand in line at a Detroit polling place during Michigan's March 10 presidential primary. As a result of the pandemic, the state's top election official is sending absentee ballot applications to every registered voter for August and November elections. Updated at 6:38 p.m. ET President Trump on Wednesday escalated his rhetorical campaign against an expansion of mail-in voting amid the coronavirus pandemic by threatening federal funding to two states with Democratic governors. Trump appeared to be set off by an announcement Tuesday from Michigan's Democratic secretary of state, Jocelyn Benson, who said her office will mail an absentee ballot application to every voter in the state for August and November elections. Trump narrowly won Michigan in 2016, giving him the Electoral College votes needed to become president. Trump is expected to visit the state  Thursday to tour a Ford facility that has been repurposed to make ventilators. In a tweet Wednesday, Trump falsely claimed the state was sending ballots, not ballot applications, and said that because of that, its federal funding was at risk.  The president wrote: "I will ask to hold up funding to Michigan if they want to go down this Voter Fraud path!" (He later deleted his original tweet and reposted, correctly writing the second time that absentee ballot applications are to be sent out. He also appeared to soften his threat to cut funding in comments later Wednesday) Michigan sends absentee ballot applications to 7.7 million people ahead of Primaries and the General Election. This was done illegally and without authorization by a rogue Secretary of State. I will ask to hold up funding to Michigan if they want to go down this Voter Fraud path! Trump made a similar threat to Nevada, which is mailing absentee ballots to all active registered voters for the state's June 9 primary — an all-mail election. Elections are run by state and local governments, and it's unclear what legal means Trump would have to withhold funds from the states. Michigan voters approved a constitutional amendment in 2018 to allow no-excuse absentee ballots, along with a number of other changes to make access to voting easier.  Benson, the Michigan secretary of state, responded to Trump's corrected tweet, noting that she's acting within her authority and that a number of states are taking the same action, including states with Republican election officials. In a statement, she added that absentee ballot "applications are mailed nearly every election cycle by both major parties and countless advocacy and nonpartisan organizations." Hi again. Still wrong. Every Michigan registered voter has a right to vote by mail. I have the authority & responsibility to make sure that they know how to exercise this right - just like my GOP colleagues are doing in GA, IA, NE and WV. Also, again, my name is Jocelyn Benson. https://t.co/deZJwbMlT0 Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak wrote on Twitter: "For the President to threaten federal funding in the midst of a pandemic over a state exercising its authority to run elections in a safe and legal manner is inappropriate and outrageous." Trump's comments come two days after Ronna McDaniel, chair of the Republican National Committee, said she's fine with absentee ballot applications.  When asked by a reporter on a call Monday what she thought about proposals to send absentee ballot applications to all voters, McDaniel, who is from Michigan, said: "Personally, I don't really have an issue with absentee ballot request forms being sent out to voters as much as ballots being sent directly to voters. ... We are really against, when people talk about mail-in voting, the ballots being sent directly to people who may or may not want them or sent to all the registered voters even when their voter rolls have not been cleaned up." Trump's objections come despite the fact that he voted by mail in Florida's recent primary and has voted absentee in previous elections.  White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany defended the president's own mailed-in vote Wednesday, stating that as a high-level official away from his state of residence, it was the most appropriate option. "He supports mail-in voting for a reason," McEnany emphasized. "When you have a reason that you're unable to be present." Research has found there's no evidence that expanding absentee voting benefits one party over the other. Likewise, extensive research suggests voter fraud is uncommon for mail-in voting. Still, Trump and some of his Republican allies have concluded that it helps Democrats, and they are trying to restrict its expansion amid the pandemic. In remarks later Wednesday, Trump further criticized the prospect, calling the remote voting option "dangerous."  "Mail-in ballots are a very dangerous thing. They're subject to massive fraud," Trump said.  He also softened his threat to remove funding. "We'll let you know if it's necessary. ... I don't think it's going to be necessary," he said.  But the push additional voting options comes at a moment when many Americans are fearful of voting in person for fear of contracting the coronavirus. Sixty percent of those surveyed in a recent AP-NORC poll said Americans should be allowed to vote absentee without an excuse if the pandemic is still a problem in November. Wisconsin officials said at least 71 cases of COVID-19 are associated with people who went to the polls in person in that state's controversial April 7 election, where thousands of voters had to wait in line to cast ballots after Republicans in the state Legislature refused to support efforts to expand mail-in voting. Some Republican officials who have expanded absentee voting in their states have faced suspicion from within their own party about those efforts. "The biggest challenge I have right now is making the concept of absentee voting less toxic for Republicans," Kentucky Secretary of State Michael Adams, a Republican, recently told NPR. His office is sending postcards to every registered voter telling them how to apply for an absentee ballot. Meanwhile, a federal court in Texas ruled Tuesday evening that voters there could cite fear of contracting the virus as a legitimate excuse for requesting an absentee ballot. The state has among the strictest requirements in the country for voting absentee, which is generally only available for those over age 65, those who have a disability or illness, or those who will be out of the state during the election. State officials are hostile to efforts to expand mail-in voting, and Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton vowed to appeal the decision to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.

"Things will never be the same," says Harry Moreaux in Naples, Fla., one of nearly 400 churchgoers who shared with NPR how the pandemic has changed their views of church life and their expectations for worship in the months and years ahead. "I love my fellow brothers and sisters in God," Moreaux wrote. "I used to go to many church-related activities like Bible studies and men's fellowship. Now we barely communicate by text." A survey by the Pew Research Center in April found more than 90% of regular churchgoers in the United States saying their churches had closed their doors to combat the spread of the coronavirus, with the vast majority saying that worship services had moved entirely online. Social hours and church suppers are a thing of the past, at least for now. The changes are not all negative. Many pastors have intensified efforts to stay in touch with members of their congregations and maintain their church communities. "This crisis has actually caused us to do a better job of picking up the phone and checking on our members," says Randal Lyle, senior pastor at Meadowridge Baptist Church in Fort Worth, Texas. "It's made me refocus on connecting individually with people. I have our staff checking on every elderly person in the congregation every couple of weeks to see what they need and how we can serve them. So there are some connections that are probably stronger now than they were before." The shift to online communication on platforms such as Zoom has also introduced some new efficiencies. Claire Anderson, 45, a devoted member of North River Church of Christ in Marietta, Ga., had been attending worship services at least twice a week with her family, plus leading Bible study sessions with other church members. Under the shutdown, she says, she's been able to do even more. "I don't have to drive an hour to sit down and read the Bible with someone," she says. "I can do it all from home. There's no running to meetings. There's no strain on my kids. There's no strain on my husband. I'm not always rushing somewhere." Anderson's spiritual life, she says, may even have been strengthened during this time. "It's almost like God is sending everyone to their room for a time out," she says. "With all the business taken away, I can just be still and really focus on my relationship with God." Drifting away from church In some cases, however, the coronavirus shutdowns have weakened church connections. The Pew survey and a survey by the Public Religion Research Institute found that one-third or more of those who had previously attended church regularly were not bothering to watch online services. For those whose church affiliation was already tenuous, the disconnect may be permanent. "I wasn't regularly attending church anyway," says Beth Daniel, 50, of Mounds View, Minn., "so it really hasn't changed anything. But now I feel less guilty about not going. I thought at first [the pandemic] might encourage me to do more online worship, but it really hasn't." Though raised in an evangelical tradition, Daniel says she has found her own time and space for spiritual connection, "and it doesn't usually happen on Sunday mornings." But Mary McGrath, 26, whose church affiliation has likewise been slipping, has reacted to the coronavirus shutdown in the opposite way, with a new yearning to return to the Catholic parish she left as a college student. "Down at my foundation, faith has a strong role, one I've kind of repressed or disregarded," she says. "And I've realized that when you're especially alone, something I haven't really experienced before, it's something I would really like to be able to fall back on. I was very surprised to have that feeling just hit me. Like, 'Wow, I would really like to be in a pew right now, in a place that's bigger and holier than I am.'" Clearly, the way churchgoers are reacting to the pandemic depends in good part on their past experience. For John Chadwick, 73, a retired Lutheran pastor in Iowa, 40 years of preaching have left him feeling that his faith no longer provides the answers he needs. "I look at the virus, and I wonder," he says. "As a pastor, I always say, 'We need to trust God in all this.' And that's OK, to say that. But I gotta admit, for me, I wonder where God is, which is not great for a pastor. I realize that, but that's where I am today." The importance of singing One of the most disturbing changes for Christians has been the suspension of congregational singing and church choirs. Health experts say the coronavirus is easily spread through singing, but music is an essential part of the worship experience for many churchgoers, especially in the Protestant tradition. "I would never have heard my call to the priesthood if I hadn't found my faith through song," says Rev. Jennifer Reddall, the Episcopal bishop for the diocese of Arizona. She was announcing the guidelines under which Episcopal churches in her diocese would be allowed to reopen. A ban on singing and choral performances was the restriction that Reddall said was most personally upsetting. "I'm not even sure I would be a Christian today if I wasn't able to pray by singing," Reddall said in a video message to the members of her diocese. "But I don't want to kill someone by my prayer or by my music." For Episcopal parishioners in Arizona, the only music option now available is to follow the church program at home. "I've been doing that," says Rachel Sampson in Tucson, "but it's starting to feel really sad and hard for me, where I'm just sitting in my living room, singing by myself. I was doing more when this all started, but now that we're eight or nine weeks into it, I'm starting to feel disconnected from it." The sense of growing separation from one's church community under pandemic conditions may be most acute for those who have depended on that community for support. In Kansas City, Mo., what Sara DeVoto treasured most about her Methodist church family was how it was a "lifeline" for her and her husband when their baby son died shortly after birth. "They came to the hospital at 4 a.m.," she says. "They made sure we had meals. They made sure our other child was getting interaction, and they helped with babysitting. Our church community was able to pray over me when I couldn't pray. It was a time that I wish hadn't happened, but it was also a time that I never felt, ever, alone." Having experienced that support, DeVoto is now saddened that providing it to someone else would be next to impossible under the current conditions. "Look what we could do in a time of tragedy that we can't do now," she says. "It's hard when we're just reaching out with phone calls to see if someone is OK. Do they really need more?" That interaction, she says, is now more difficult than it used to be "when we could stop by and go into someone's house and see what they need." Support, solace and a spiritual bond are some of the things that matter in a worship experience. For some people, those are also the things they now realize their church was not providing. Under the coronavirus shutdowns, such distinctions have become all the clearer.

             Cargo containers are stacked on a ship at California's Port of Los Angeles. Consumer goods are arriving from China and elsewhere, but a lot is not getting to its destination. At least once a week, the Port of Los Angeles launches a drone over its expansive facility. It gives port officials a good vantage point to check on the 7,500 acres and 43 miles of waterway that make up the busiest container port in North America. Earlier this month, the port's executive director, Gene Seroka, displayed photos from a recent drone flight showing stacks of cargo containers on the docks.  Consumer goods are arriving from China and elsewhere, but a lot is not getting to its destination. "Demand has plummeted because you and I are not out at the stores every day," Seroka says. "The orders that go to store are less than they normally would be." Instead, Seroka says much of the cargo is being moved to a vast warehouse and distribution center complex in Southern California. "We have approximately 1% vacancy in our more than 1.8 billion square feet of warehousing," he says. This is a scenario playing out at many ports in the U.S. and the rest of the world, as the coronavirus upends global supply chains. Department stores and retail outlets that ordered consumer goods — from clothing to auto parts — ahead of the pandemic are now shut. But container ships were already underway and now cargo has no place to go. Lars Jensen, the founder of Copenhagen-based SeaIntelligence Consulting, says the cargo's often left on the docks. "If you look at India, for example, there was a period here where at least 60% of the truck drivers were not at work because they had been put in quarantine," he says. "So you might not actually have the trucking capacity to move it." Or Jensen says there are serious cash flow problems, such as an importer going bankrupt. "That is a very real risk in these days, which obviously means he's not going to come down to the port to pick it up," he says. Jensen says other importers have run out of warehouse space. This is a complete reversal from late February and early March, when Western importers were desperate to get goods again from China after the country had been closed down because of the coronavirus, says Shereen Zarkani, global head of sales for shipping giant Maersk. "As soon as China started opening up, we had this rush of our customers asking to really find ways to speed up the supply chain," she says.  Then the coronavirus spread to Europe, the U.S. and elsewhere. "All of a sudden, those same customers who were really rushing to get the cargo in, we started having completely different conversations on how do we store cargo," she says. Maersk is one of several companies that is now storing large numbers of shipping containers at hubs scattered across the globe. "We have around five big ones around the world like in Malaysia or in Morocco," Zarkani says. "We store our customers' cargo there so that [it's] ready once demand starts picking up." At that point, the customer can decide to ship it to the original destination or to a new place. SeaIntelligence's Jensen says other shipping companies, like French-owned CMA CGM, are changing routes in order to slow down the shipments and save money now that oil prices are very low. They can bypass Egypt's Suez Canal, where a single transit fee for a big container ship can cost half a million dollars, he explains. "Suddenly, it makes sense to take a long route all the way around Africa and not use the Suez Canal," Jensen says. "And there's apparently a lot of the importers that don't really mind the cargo being a week delayed." Traders may be willing to wait — at least until the coronavirus pandemic is over and consumer demand returns.In normal times, hotels promote their star chefs or their swanky design upgrades. But priorities have changed. In the age of the coronavirus, the news from Hilton is a partnership — with Lysol. As hotel guests begin to return, the standard expectation of hygiene has been elevated to "where it's cleanliness almost with a double exclamation point after it," says Phil Cordell, Hilton's global head of brand development. Hotels have been devastated by the pandemic. Seven out of 10 hotel rooms in the U.S. remain empty, according to the research firm STR. And that's the hotels that are actually open. To survive, they are adapting — not just with extra-deep cleaning, but with technology that allows for more contactless interactions. And some amenities that guests normally find in their rooms are going away. The challenges for an industry reeling from massive layoffs and lost revenue are daunting. A comeback will start with baby steps. At Hilton and other hotels, guests can expect disinfectants to be applied liberally and visibly — for cleanliness and for psychological reassurance, says Jim Coyle of Coyle Hospitality, a customer experience consulting company. "When you get a guest key, you will see the staff members," he says. "They will conspicuously wipe the guest key in front of you before they hand it to you. When you arrive at a desk, you're going to see hotel staff wiping the desk clean in front of you even though there's nothing on it." 
                Hilton is working with Lysol's parent company and the Mayo Clinic on disinfection and cleanliness standards for its hotels.

             Hilton is working with Lysol's parent company and the Mayo Clinic on disinfection and cleanliness standards for its hotels. And when you get to your room, there will be more efforts at reassurance. Marriott International has identified 12 touch points for extra disinfectant, including doorknobs, thermostats, door handles and drawer knobs. Hilton is teaming up with RB, the parent company of Lysol, and the Mayo Clinic. As Hilton rolls out its CleanStay campaign, Cordell says guests will notice some familiar objects missing. "They will see that some of the items in the room that could likely be fingerprinted by previous guests — magazines, notepads, pens — those items have been removed from the room," he says. And there's likely to be more. Coyle says the hotel-room phone has probably seen its last days because of the coronavirus. And what about that most divisive object in the hotel room? "I think the death of the minibar is probably finally here," Coyle says. The remote control will likely be encased in a plastic bag or envelope with a sticker indicating it has been disinfected. Hotels will be promoting apps that allow guests to check in without interacting with the front desk. A more ambitious technology — a digital key — that allows guests to unlock their rooms with their phones is likely to become more commonplace. All these steps have one purpose: to assure travelers that hotels are safe — or at least as safe as they possibly can be while the coronavirus is still with us. An early test will be convincing business travelers like Liz Oppenheim, who lives outside Boston. She's itching to get back on the road. "The longer I go without traveling, the more I just don't feel like a person," she says. "I literally have dreams almost every night about traveling." Oppenheim works with pharmaceutical companies on clinical trials and normally spends three or four nights a week in hotels. She enjoys it. For one thing, she racks up a lot of loyalty points. "I have all the statuses," she says with a laugh. For now, her travel is on pause. And as Oppenheim contemplates staying in hotels again, there's one word she uses a lot: anxious. "There's something about slipping between the sheets — the clean, white crisp sheets of a hotel — that's just incredibly relaxing, especially if you've ... had a hard, tense day at work, and it's just so wonderful. But I think I will be anxious." As hotels spray, disinfect and purge their rooms of pens, magazines and notepads, they may eliminate germs. But will they eliminate anxiety? Hotels are about to find out.

             Rep. Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut is one of the progressive Democrats pushing to expand some of the safety net programs created since the coronavirus pandemic. Democrats said the $3 trillion coronavirus aid bill that was approved last week in the House of Representatives is meant to meet the needs of everyday Americans. Republicans dismissed that same bill as a partisan attempt to enact a longstanding wish list of Democratic policy priorities.  Progressive Democrats don't exactly dispute that. "Over 80% of the bill we have already passed in one way, shape or form," House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., told reporters last week. "So, now we're putting our offer on the table. We're open to negotiation." The bill that passed the House on Friday is full of proposals Democrats on the left have been pitching for years — from a more generous allowance for food stamps to changes in the way people qualify for federal benefits. Many progressives see the economic crisis caused by the coronavirus and the public health response as proof that more expansive social policies are needed now, and in the future, to help people survive in times of crisis.  "The coronavirus pandemic has exposed gaping holes in our social safety net and has brought into stark relief issues that we knew were there," said Rep. Katherine Clark, D-Mass., the House Democratic Caucus vice chair. "Now we can see their devastating impacts so clearly." Among the policies Clark supported in the House bill is a provision to provide funding for child care providers. She said women have always borne the brunt of the effects when schools and day care centers are closed. The issue is playing out on an enormous scale with the coronavirus. Clark and other Democrats proposed $50 billion in immediate child care funding. They also advocated for another $50 billion to fund long-term structural change.  Republicans, such as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., call that logic gross politics. "Democrats cannot stop salivating, salivating over the possibilities for partisan gain," McConnell said last week on the Senate floor. "Eighty-thousand Americans have died. More than 20 million have lost their jobs. I call that a crisis. They call it leverage." Progressive Democrats said they are simply advocating for programs that are gaining public support in the crisis.  Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., said until the coronavirus hit, Republicans generally didn't support any expansion of domestic spending intended to help people in a crisis. Now there is a crisis, and Democrats want to use this moment to remake the system. "These folks have never wanted to go down this road and protect what was a social safety net that we've had in the past and a new social safety net for people in today's world," DeLauro said in an interview. "I've been fighting for these issues for a very, very long time, OK. I'm trying to deal with the pandemic." Democrats have a running list of policies they said are helping now during the coronavirus crisis and could be used to support people during any future economic dip. Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, said he wants to tie the expanded benefits that passed in the CARES Act to the unemployment rate going forward. Such a proposal would allow the benefits to ebb and flow to meet the economy.   Wyden said the existing system hasn't worked for a long time. Many states provide benefits below the minimum wage, and the system does not regularly support people who are paid contractors or work in the so-called gig economy. "The unemployment system, which was invented in the 1930s, is still in kind of a time warp," Wyden said. "Nobody ever heard of a gig worker back in the 1930s." Many progressives see the coronavirus response as a chance to prove that policies they support can work and should be made permanent. Some of these benefits, such as extra unemployment assistance, already got big bipartisan support and will be harder to take away later.  Not all Democrats necessarily agree.  Moderates, such as Rep. Stephanie Murphy, D-Fla., are not eager to use the coronavirus to advocate for long-term spending increases. Murphy, who is a co-chair of the fiscally conservative Blue Dog Coalition, said any policies need to be reevaluated over time.  "I agree that in a crisis, you really highlight the deficiencies in our society," Murphy said in an interview. "But I also believe that the best approach to legislating in a divided Congress is to do what is possible and that means it has to be able to make it through a divided Congress and signed by a Republican president. Only things that become law can actually help the people that we're trying to assist." Several moderate Democrats, including Rep. Abigail Spanberger, D-Va., voted against the $3 trillion House bill over similar concerns. "Unfortunately, many members of Congress — including some in my own party — have decided to use this package as an opportunity to make political statements and propose a bill that goes far beyond pandemic relief and has no chance at becoming law," Spanberger said in a statement.  "We must come together to build a targeted, timely relief package that avoids partisan posturing and instead prioritizes combating our nationwide public health emergency, addressing catastrophic unemployment rates, and protecting the security of the next generation." Murphy said there are clear bipartisan options out there. She pointed to  funding for state and local governments that can bring the two parties together and a proposal to extend and expand a tax credit for businesses that keep employees on the payroll during the crisis. Those bipartisan proposals may succeed in the near-term, but progressives are also looking to see how their policies can be sustained well into the future. Democrats are hoping to take control of the Senate and the White House in November, which would make it easier to build on temporary programs and permanently remake the system.

             Dr. Deborah Birx, White House coronavirus response coordinator, listens during a meeting at the White House earlier this month. White House coronavirus task force coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx said on Tuesday that she is encouraged by the latest data showing declines in new cases of the virus, hospitalizations and deaths across all but a few areas of the United States. Birx told a group of reporters at the White House that clinical, laboratory data and surveillance data from across the country shows that new hospitalizations have dropped by 50% in the last 30 days, and deaths continue to decrease week over week. "All states have dropped under 20% test positive, and New York has gone from over 45% test positive just 30 days ago, to under 10% test positive," Birx said. "These types of declines are being seen across the board except in a few areas." Three exceptions, where indicators have plateaued rather than declined: the Washington D.C., metro area, Chicago, and Los Angeles. "We're dissecting each one of these plateaus and providing daily updates to the task force on what's community spread and what's outbreak in terms of new cases. We study these three metros that are closed and have been closed to understand where precisely the new cases are coming from and how to prevent new infections," Birx said. Otherwise, Birx said major metropolitan areas are starting to improve significantly. Testing has expanded, including among populations most vulnerable to the virus, to find asymptomatic cases early and expand contact tracing and isolating new cases, she said. Outbreaks at nursing homes, meat packing plants and prisons are being stopped "on a regular and ongoing basis" she said. "A lot of states have been doing exactly what we asked them to: find, test, contract trace, and contain. They are finding the first case, finding the other 50 cases — or finding the other 100 cases that are often asymptomatic by testing everyone in the plant, or nursing home, or prison — and stopping community spread. And that's been very reassuring to me," Birx said. She added that the task force is focused on finding where the virus starts in a community before it spreads.  Birx said she has been talking to the military about how they've created teams and sub-teams, and wants to work with manufacturers and other groups to adopt such measures in the workplace. "When you can align work shifts and physically who you regularly interact with in the factory, teams of people always working together, it's an easier way to test these specific groups and stop outbreaks," she said. The U.S. has had more than 1.5 million confirmed cases so far and more than 90,000 deaths according to Johns Hopkins — by far the highest counts in the world.

             A man walks past a sign reading "Welcome Back, Now Open" on Fort Lauderdale Beach Boulevard in Fort Lauderdale, Florida on May 18. There are still a lot of questions about how the coronavirus is transmitted through air. Researchers are looking at how the virus is spread indoors and how to safely have people under one roof. As states around the country lift restrictions and businesses reopen, many workers in close-contact jobs are scared for their health and would rather stay on unemployment.

             A woman in a face mask walks on a deserted Ocean Drive last week in Miami Beach, Fla. War game simulation in the early 2000s foresaw an overwhelmed health care industry struggling to respond to unprecedented demand. One day in early March, as the coronavirus was spreading across the country, Margaret McCown was in her office at the Pentagon figuring out how her staff could work from home. As McCown went over the logistics, she began to feel a sense of déjà vu. A pandemic. Government on alert. Schools and offices closing. It was a scenario she had seen before. Just not in real life. "That was that uncomfortable moment where you find yourself a little bit living in your own war game," McCown said. Starting in 2006, when she was a war gamer at the National Defense University, McCown spent two years running pandemic simulations for senior policymakers. The scenario: A novel flu strain is racing across the planet. The virus is deadly and highly contagious; U.S. officials are trying to contain the outbreak before it hits the United States. (Spoiler: They don't succeed.) McCown called the first exercise "Global Tempest." In the office that day in March, she dug out an article she'd written about it for a defense journal. The title was "Wargaming the Flu." "As I looked through it, I was realizing the extent to which it had really identified some of the things that we were living and some of the debates I was seeing on TV," she said. In McCown's simulations, as in several others in the early 2000s, participants foresaw an overwhelmed health care industry struggling to respond to unprecedented demand. McCown's teams worried about the number of ventilators and hospital beds.  What's more interesting to McCown is that the gamers also identified the many ways a pandemic could disrupt ordinary life. "People's ability to take time off work or having sick leave would impact their ability to abide by social distancing," McCown said. "And that decisions like when you close schools and so forth would come to be important." McCown's pandemic series involved senior leaders from federal agencies, Congress and the Pentagon. Those and other games of that era predicted, in detail, much of the fallout the government is struggling with now. So the question is: Where's the disconnect between years of gaming out pandemic strategies and the chaotic response on display now? War gamers say it's not their job to tell leaders what to do – they just shepherd officials through their options, trying to get them to think strategically about the potential consequences of different policies. In the end, the decisions on national security priorities are up to those in power. And for a number of reasons, current and former officials say, the specter of a pandemic never made it to the top of the list. Administrations came and went, each with its own national security agenda. And in the years after the Sept. 11 attacks, the focus was on the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and terrorist groups such as al-Qaida and, later, ISIS. Unlike a virus, those threats were visible and tangible. "Pandemic may not have waned in importance, but other national security issues kind of crowded attention more," McCown said. McCown's flu series was part of a trend in pandemic war gaming that rose in the decade after the Sept. 11 attacks. The exercises had ominous names: Dark Winter, Clade X, Atlantic Storm. And they didn't end well. Some teams faced catastrophic death tolls and riots in the streets. The participants in McCown's games grew pessimistic that medical interventions could catch up with the damage caused by the virus. By the end of the series, she said, the teams were "focusing more on what would you do if none of those worked or took a long time to become available." They discussed nightmare scenarios of poultry culling and civil unrest. "All told, exercises moved away from what could be characterized as an emergency response understanding of the problem toward a more public health understanding," McCown concluded in her report.

             Sen. Pat Roberts, R-Kan., speaks during a Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee hearing on new coronavirus tests on Capitol Hill on May 7. Sen. Pat Roberts, a Kansas Republican who's been in Congress nearly 40 years, took part in some of the earliest pandemic games, including McCown's series. Through the Senate Agriculture Committee, he's also helped shape U.S. responses to real outbreaks. When the coronavirus hit, he said, he recognized the severity right away. It was the big one he'd been dreading for years. "We worked on African swine fever — that's H1N1 — and also the avian flu, and now we're working very hard on COVID-19," Roberts said. "So, yeah, this is not my first rodeo." Roberts said each experience was instructive – and alarming. It became clear to him that the nation needed to prepare for a potentially catastrophic pandemic, whether caused by an act of bioterrorism or a virus transmitted from animals to humans. "From time to time, there were all these warnings, and we were trying to get the attention of all the intelligence agencies: Move this to the top of the line,"  Roberts said. "I don't know how many times I asked the CIA when I was the intel chairman." The senator said he can't divulge the CIA's specific response, but he said the outbreak threat just never stuck as a national security priority. As Roberts put it: "You could never get it in the top 10." The Pentagon's McCown said there are lessons and limits to war games. No simulation can prevent a deadly new virus from snowballing into a pandemic. But she said there's value in "creating that space for people to think through problems in a hypothetical set of circumstances." Fourteen years after her first pandemic simulation, McCown said, the experience is coming in handy at work and at home. "When I'm Cloroxing my car keys and wiping down my doorknob and picking up delivery groceries and so forth," she said, "I'm thinking through [the] big picture of why am I doing this, and, you know, not just the nuisance factor."

             Facebook hopes to make commerce a bigger part of its operation by letting businesses set up storefronts in its apps. Facebook is making a big push into online shopping by letting businesses set up free storefronts on its social network and Instagram. Businesses can feature items in their shops, advertise them to users, and communicate with customers through the company's messaging services. Shops will eventually be integrated across Facebook's apps, including WhatsApp and Messenger. Shoppers can buy products either through links to the businesses' own websites or by using Instagram's checkout feature, which enables purchasing within the app. Checkout will become available on Facebook in the future. The company has been looking to make commerce a bigger part of its business in a bid to capture users' time and new sources of revenue. CEO Mark Zuckerberg said those efforts have ramped up because of the coronavirus pandemic, which has left many of the 160 million small businesses that use Facebook's apps struggling. "We're seeing a lot of small businesses that never had online presences get online for the first time, and we're seeing small businesses that had online presences now make them their primary way of doing business," he said in a livestreamed announcement Tuesday. "For lots of small businesses during this period, this is the difference between staying afloat and going under." Facebook will not charge businesses to create virtual storefronts, Zuckerberg said.  "We know that if [Facebook] Shops are valuable for businesses they're going to in general want to bid more for ads. We'll eventually make money that way," he said, noting that small businesses make up "the vast majority" of Facebook advertisers. Facebook first launched the checkout feature last year on Instagram in the U.S., letting people stay in the app to complete their purchases. Instagram takes a cut of each sale.

             The Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday heard testimony about coronavirus economic relief efforts from Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. Members of the Senate Banking Committee squabbled Tuesday over how quickly the U.S. economy can rebound from the coronavirus shutdown and whether the federal government is doing enough to support struggling families and businesses in the meantime. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell defended the government's multi-trillion-dollar relief efforts to date.   Powell stressed additional measures may be necessary to prevent lasting economic damage.  The challenges of reopening parts of the economy were underscored by the hearing's format. It was held virtually, with both witnesses and senators on videoconference, though Mnuchin said he would have been willing to testify in person. Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown, the ranking Democrat on the committee, accused the Trump administration of pushing businesses to reopen prematurely, without adequate safeguards for workers.  "How many workers should give their lives to increase our GDP by half a percent?" Brown asked. Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., countered: "The longer that we continue a shutdown — when weeks turn into months — doesn't that necessarily increase the risk that some businesses will fail, some jobs won't be there to go back to?" The treasury secretary agreed. Mnuchin and Powell said the Fed's emergency lending programs for midsize businesses and for state and local governments should be up and running by the end of this month. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., complained that those programs — authorized by Congress with some $450 billion in seed money — do not including binding requirements that loan recipients keep workers on the payroll.  "We're in a situation where 35 million Americans have filed for unemployment," Warren said. "You're in charge of half a trillion dollars. You're boosting your Wall Street buddies and you are leaving Americans behind."  Mnuchin disputed that characterization and said the terms of the lending programs had been negotiated with both Republicans and Democrats in Congress. The treasury secretary also said the government is willing to take some risks in financing the emergency loans. "We are fully prepared to take losses in certain scenarios," Mnuchin said.  Powell reiterated his view that Congress may have to authorize additional relief spending to keep families, businesses and cash-strapped state and local governments afloat until the virus is under control. "What Congress has done to date has been remarkably timely and forceful," the Fed chairman said. "I do think we need to take a step back and ask, over time, is it enough? And we need to be prepared to act further." In addition to the Fed's lending programs, the government has made hundreds of billions of dollars worth of loans to small businesses, which can be forgiven so long as most of the money is used for payroll. Mnuchin said he's eager to work with lawmakers to give borrowers in that program more flexibility. In 2004, ABC News correspondent Dan Harris was broadcasting live on the air on Good Morning America when he started experiencing a panic attack. "My lungs seized up, my palms started sweating, my mouth dried up. I just couldn't speak," he says. "I had to quit in the middle of my little newscast. And it was really embarrassing." Harris credits meditation with helping him work through the anxiety that caused that panic attack. He went on to write a memoir, 10% Happier, about his experiences with meditation, and he talks about the subject on his twice-weekly podcast. He's also been hosting a daily meditation online with different leaders in the community of people who study and teach mindfulness techniques. Harris says that meditation is more important than ever during the global pandemic: "I don't think we should sugarcoat it: It's scary," he says. "I've taken to saying, if you're not anxious right now, you're not paying attention." Though he's been trying to help people quiet their anxiety with meditation and mindfulness techniques, he's careful to note that meditation isn't a "silver bullet" cure. "Meditation doesn't make the uncertainty go away," he says. "It's not like I meditate and I'm walking through this pandemic like a unicorn barfing rainbows all the time." Rather, Harris says, meditation allows people to "relax into the uncertainty. ... It just means that you're able to see that the fear — like everything in the world — will come and go, and that if you just relax for a second, and breathe into it, it will come and go."

How? On how a leading meditation teacher recommended the loving-kindness meditation as the best support during this pandemic I had a very negative reaction to loving-kindness meditation [at first]. First of all, the name itself. I mean, could you come up with anything more treacly? And then it gets worse when you actually hear what the practice entails. So here's how it works: You sit and close your eyes and you envision a series of beings, so people or animals. Classically, you start with yourself and then you move on to a good friend, it can be your pet or kid, some easy person in your life that it's very easy to generate warmth for. Then you move on to a mentor, a benefactor or somebody who's played a positive role in your life. ... And then you move on to a neutral person, somebody you often overlook. And this is a poignant category right now, because the neutral people — the people manning the cash registers at the supermarkets and delivering our food and mail, and the neutral people for many of us that we often overlooked — are saving our lives quite literally now. Then you move on to a difficult person — not hard to find for many of us. And then finally, all beings. In each case, you summon a mental image or a felt sense of your targeted being, and then you repeat a series of phrases. Usually the phrases are, "May you be happy. May you be safe. May you be healthy. May you live with ease." ... There's a lot of science that strongly suggests that this practice and its variance can produce really meaningful physiological, psychological and behavioral changes. And if you think about it, this is a radical notion, the idea that warmth, friendliness, kindness, dare I say love — these are not factory settings that are unalterable. You aren't wired a certain way when it comes to your interpersonal relations and unchangeable. In fact, these are skills that you can develop. And that is such a radical notion, that the mind is trainable. I've been doing this loving-kindness meditation now pretty intensively — including going on long retreats where that's all you do — for several years. And I've found it's made a big difference in terms of my inner weather, and how I relate to my own ugliness, because we all have ugliness.

             ABC News correspondent Dan Harris (shown here in 2018) credits meditation with helping him work through the anxiety that caused an on-air panic attack in 2004. On the important difference between fear and panic  I'm largely stealing this from a rather brilliant woman I met right at the beginning of the pandemic. The first pandemic-themed episode I did was in mid-March. And one of the guests was a woman named Dr. Luana Marques. She's Brazilian by birth, but now works at Harvard as an anxiety expert. And she told me about something called the — I think this is the right name — Yerkes-Dodson [Law]. You can look this up on Google; it's a bell-shaped curve. And it talks about this sort of utility of anxiety, which is an interesting concept. And it kind of gives us permission to not feel bad about the fact that we're feeling a certain amount of justifiable fear and anxiety. And so at the beginning of the slope, right until you get to the top of the curve, the anxiety and fear that we may be feeling in the face of this pandemic or anything really, makes sense. It motivates us to act. But then it starts to go downhill. And that's when we tip into not very helpful panic, where we constrict and the physiological response is enfeebling and we're not able to make good decisions. That's when we hoard toilet paper or we're nasty to our neighbors or we spread misinformation on Twitter, whatever it may be. So what we want is to be at the top of the Yerkes-Dodson curve with the appropriate amount of anxiety without tipping in to panic. That is where I feel mindfulness meditation — the kind of meditation with which most people are familiar — that's one of the areas where mindfulness meditation can be really helpful. On how many people are experiencing vivid dreams during the pandemic I've been having wild dreams — classic anxiety dreams where I'm trying to get somewhere and I can't get there, or I'm being chased or I'm back in school. This is being reported widely across our culture, across the globe, as I understand it, and I was talking to Dr. Mark Epstein about this. ... I had him on the show originally and I was asking him, why do you think we're having these crazy dreams? And, in typical fashion, he gave the disclaimer that he doesn't really know, but his instinct is that we're "processing." That's what we're doing in these dreams is we're sort of flushing out, purging, processing the — this is his term, not mine — the collective trauma and the collective grief we're all experiencing right now. It can be jarring to have these dreams, but you might look at it as the functioning of a healthy brain and mind. The key part of meditation is to get distracted, to see the wildness of your own mind over and over and over again, and then to begin again — and again and again.  Dan Harris On how to practice mindfulness meditation  You sit in a quiet enough spot and you then bring your full attention to the feeling of your breath coming in and going out. You don't have to breathe in any special way. This is not actually a breathing exercise. And there's nothing special about the breath per se, we're just picking something south of your neck to pay attention, we're going to get your attention out of the swirling stories in your head and onto the raw data of your physical sensations. So it can be your breath. For some of us, the breath right now is triggering, given the fact that COVID-19, has pulmonary consequences. So you might want to pick just the feeling of your full body sitting or lying — or maybe your hands touching, or your bottom on your chair, just picking some physical anchor to where you can place your mind and you just kind of commit to it, gently, that I'm going to pay attention to this for one to five to 10 minutes. That's the second step, and then the third step, the final step really, and this is the most important step — as soon as you try to do this, your mind will go into a mutiny mode. You're going to start thinking about, when can I get a haircut? Where do gerbils run wild? Why did Dances with Wolves beat Goodfellas for Best Picture in 1991? Blah, blah, blah. And the whole game is just to notice when you've become distracted and to start again, and again, and again. And this distraction, by the way, is not a failure. It is not a malfunction. It is part of the meditation. The key part of meditation is to get distracted, to see the wildness of your own mind over and over and over again, and then to begin again and again and again. ... It is the seeing of the wildness of the cacophony that is really important, because when you see it, it doesn't own you as much. On why meditation isn't about controlling your mind It's actually not about trying to tamp down on or control the way the mind works. It's about familiarization. Just getting to know how nutty it is inside your brain, inside your mind, is incredibly important, because when you've tipped over into panic or any other unhelpful, unskillful mind state — like greed or anger or hatred — then you might notice it. And then you have a choice: Am I going to be owned by this panic right now or am I going to be owned by this anger right now? Or am I going to be so controlled by the anger that I'm going to say something that's going to ruin the next 48 hours of my marriage? Or am I going to eat the 75th Oreo? Having this self-awareness — otherwise known as mindfulness — which is what's developed through the process of seeing your distractions and then beginning again (gently over and over and over again), that is a game-changing skill. Because ... this nonstop conversation ... is a central feature of your life — whether you know it or not, we're all walking around with this inner narrator that if we broadcast loud, you would be locked up. And when you're unaware of this cacophony internally, it's owning you all the time. And what we're doing in meditation is dragging all of this nonsense out of the shadows and into the light. On why focusing your energy on helping others can quiet the feelings of loneliness and despair during the pandemic  Helping other people puts you back in touch with what is good about you. And it can take you out of the black hole of self-obsession. And those are two really useful benefits of helping other people. It doesn't have to be grandiose. It doesn't have to be giving away all of your money. It can be running errands for your elderly neighbor. It can be checking in on friends. It can be making small donations to charity. It can be volunteering at a safe social distance with local nonprofit groups. There are lots of ways to help out. Adopting a cat, adopting a dog — many, many ways to get you out of the self-obsessed dialogue and put you in touch with your best characteristics, which are helping.

             Kevin Harvick gets out of his car in victory lane after winning the NASCAR Cup Series auto race Sunday in Darlington, S.C. The trickle of a pro sports comeback in this country is starting to happen following widespread shutdowns due to the coronavirus outbreak. NASCAR returned last weekend. Mixed martial arts did the same earlier this month. Now the governors of two hard-hit states — California and New York — are endorsing a return to professional play. "Pro sports," California Gov. Gavin Newsom said Monday, "in that first week or so of June, without spectators, and modifications, and very prescriptive conditions, can begin to move forward." There is a definite feeling of momentum for a sports restart. Fans have been hearing about potential reopening scenarios for baseball and basketball in particular.  But with the coronavirus still spreading, is there a need for caution? Too many cases If you ask Emory University epidemiologist Zach Binney, the short answer is yes.  "The truth is, in the U.S. right now, we still have a high burden of cases," said Binney, who also writes and consults about sports injuries and athletes' health.  "It varies from area to area, but overall, we have a lot of sick people. That's a problem [in professional sports], because it increases the likelihood of somebody in a league getting infected and then spreading it around the league, where you may be in sustained close contact with a lot of other folks, teammates and people on other teams if you play in a contact sport." Another significant factor is testing for the coronavirus. There still isn't enough in the United States, and Binney said there should be more so sports leagues can, in good conscience, do the kind of rigorous screening needed. "If the general population and even first responders and health care workers don't have the tests they need," Binney said, "then it would raise severe ethical questions for a pro sports team to be testing their folks on a daily basis."  NASCAR, for one, is getting around this issue by not testing. The return to stock car racing at the famed Darlington Raceway in South Carolina was notable for its numerous safety precautions. There were no fans in the grandstand, and the number of support people at the track was limited. But there wasn't on-site testing. NASCAR officials said they were being sensitive to the country's test shortage. "These tests remain in short supply," John Bobo, NASCAR's vice president of racing operations, said last month. "Getting results can take two to three days. Really those tests should be targeted for people most in need." Still, the lack of testing might have increased the risk for those at the race. Violations and a promise to "be better" At a UFC event this month in Jacksonville, Fla., there also were rigorous health and safety measures in place, including testing. But there were violations of those measures, even after a fighter and two of his cornermen tested positive for the coronavirus and were removed from the event. Rules required social distancing, no touching or face-to-face, post-match interviews. But after fighter Justin Gaethje slugged his way to victory, TV interviewer Joe Rogan stood next to him and shook one of Gaethje's bloody hands, saying, "I don't care." Asked about the violations, UFC President Dana White promised to "be better." Other leagues, plotting their returns, hope to avoid problems like these from the outset. Recognizing an uncertain path Last week, MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred described baseball's enormous set of proposed safety measures. "They're extraordinarily detailed," Manfred told CNN. "They cover everything from how the players will travel, [flying] private charters, how those charters have to be cleaned, who has access to the ballpark, strict limits on [the] number of people, tiering of employees so even those people who are in the ballpark will be isolated in general from the players. So we'll hope that we'll be able to convince them that it's safe." It's a daunting task to get this all ready for a projected June spring training and July start to the regular season. But Binney, the Emory epidemiologist, said he thinks baseball, the NBA, pro hockey and soccer could return this summer — with restart plans that acknowledge the virus's uncertain path. "As long as you recognize that any plans that you're making are provisional and you're not completely locking yourself in and saying this is going to happen," Binney said, "then I have absolutely no problem with anybody doing any planning." Money is part of the planning, too. Athletes in all sports face pay cuts in these interrupted seasons. Baseball players know it's a bad look to squabble over finances right now with so many people hurting economically. But many players said owners' proposed cuts are too much, especially if the athletes potentially are putting their health on the line by playing during a pandemic. Tampa Bay Rays pitcher and 2018 Cy Young Award winner Blake Snell gave voice to player concerns on his Twitch channel.  "I'm sorry if you guys think differently," Snell said, "but the risk is way the hell higher and the amount of money I make is way lower, why would I think about doing that? So, in my head, I'm preparing for next season." To reopen or not Leagues are not saying that, at this point, but most do face a tough choice in the coming weeks.  To reopen or not. Manfred said if this season is permanently scuttled, baseball's losses would approach $4 billion. The financial cost across sports would be enormous. There's an emotional cost too for fans. "Sports for me are very much how I tell time," said Sara Ziegler, sports editor for FiveThirtyEight. And right now is the time when pro hockey and basketball playoffs normally would be at full throttle. "One of the sad things [would be] not seeing conclusions of some special seasons," Ziegler said.  "[NBA star] LeBron [James] making another run. Giannis [Antetokounmpo] and the [Milwaukee] Bucks having such a great year. It won't look like that in the record books if we can't finish it out." Every plan to restart play ultimately is at the mercy of the coronavirus and the country's ability to bring it under control. States are reopening and governors are speaking hopefully about pro sports coming back to keep us entertained.  But most sports leagues still have to weigh the possible consequences of a comeback so many want, but that can't be too soon.

             Millions of Uber drivers and other people who make a living from gig work are temporarily eligible for unemployment benefits. But the money has been slow to arrive. Music is jazz composer Michael O'Dell's passion, but it doesn't pay the bills. So he drives for Lyft and Uber in Columbus, Ohio. Since the coronavirus pandemic hit, demand for rides has fallen so much, he says, that on many days he can't get enough business to make it worth getting in the car. "I have really cut my driving down probably like 90%," he said. "If I do need available cash to pay a bill or two or even buy food, I'll go out and drive for a little bit. But I definitely don't put the time into it like I normally did, because I'm not going to get good rides." O'Dell and millions of other people who make a living from gig work — like driving for Uber or renting rooms on Airbnb — now have a lifeline. They are temporarily eligible for unemployment benefits, thanks to the federal Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or CARES Act, which became law in March. But many states are struggling to help this new class of workers. "I've been applying every week," O'Dell said. "Every single week I get denied regular unemployment." That's because Lyft and Uber don't consider themselves to be his employer. The companies say their millions of drivers are independent contractors who choose when and how much to work. Many apps operate this way, from the ride-hailing companies to grocery delivery services DoorDash and Instacart. That decision has big consequences for workers. "Normally, if you're eligible for unemployment insurance, it's because your employer has been paying into the insurance system, and as part of paying in, they're reporting your earnings," said Jay Shambaugh, director of the Brookings Institution's Hamilton Project. Because the apps do not do this, gig workers have to show proof of their earnings, so the state knows how much to give them in unemployment benefits. In turn, states have to set up systems to process those claims — which Shambaugh describes as "the big holdup." According to the Hamilton Project, 39 states and the District of Columbia are now processing those claims. But it is taking a long time for payments to go out. Jerome Gage, a Lyft driver in Los Angeles, applied for unemployment in early March because his income had dropped so much. "They said, 'Based on your reported earnings from Lyft and Uber, your [award] is zero dollars, because your employee earnings were zero dollars,'" he said. He has appealed and is awaiting a decision.  In many states, unemployment offices have been overwhelmed by the crush of workers who have lost their jobs — 36.5 million in the past eight weeks. Congress gave states $1 billion to hire more staff and upgrade their outdated computer systems, but many are still scrambling to keep up. "As it turns out, that billion dollars was maybe not quite enough to process initial claims," said Michele Evermore, senior policy analyst at the National Employment Law Project. "The increase in funding is a 50% increase ... but the increase in claims is a thousandfold." That wait has dire consequences for people whose lives are already precarious. In Decatur, Ga., attorney Mary Irene Dickerson of the Atlanta Legal Aid Society has seen an uptick in calls about eviction notices. "Then it turns out that the problem is that they've been waiting for their unemployment claims to be determined — waiting weeks," she said. She said gig workers are facing especially long waits because Georgia requires them to apply for regular unemployment and be denied — a process that can take weeks — before they can apply under the expanded eligibility provision of the CARES Act. Back in Ohio, Michael O'Dell is trying to stay hopeful. The state launched its system to accept claims from gig workers this month, and O'Dell has been calling the office to check on his status. "It always ends up hanging up on me, saying, 'We are overloaded at this moment. We're sorry, we can't take your call.' Click, bye," he said. He said he has no choice but to keep trying. Editor's note: Lyft and Uber are among NPR's financial supporters.Last June, days after her 40th birthday, Silver felt a lump in her left breast that turned out to be a tumor that had spread to her lung and liver. For eight months, she underwent chemotherapy that reduced the masses to operable size. But last month, Silver's oncologist explained a mastectomy would also require an additional procedure to take skin off her back, known as a "flap" to cover the wound. That secondary surgery was considered cosmetic and therefore nonessential, according to the standards put in place this spring because of the coronavirus pandemic. Silver's surgery, like many others, was put on hold. "It's not necessarily considered a medical emergency by them, even though it's, like, the entire world to me," Silver says. NPR is using only her first name, at her request, to preserve her medical privacy. She felt shattered, she says, especially because she was unable to see her parents or get hugs from her friends. "My one hope to be a long-term survivor was kind of fading, and now I'm going to have to pioneer a new hope," she says. "That was tough. It was awful." COVID-19 has taken the medical focus away from many other serious diseases, including cancer. According to the American Cancer Society, more than a quarter of patients with active cancer are reporting delays in treatment. Also, cancer screenings are down, meaning many conditions will worsen while the health system diverts to fight the virus. At the same time, the pandemic is creating bottlenecks in care. "We are paying a price with lives lost — not only from COVID-19 — but from people who need medical care and are afraid to get it or reluctant to go," says Len Lichtenfeld, deputy chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society in Atlanta. He says his organization's study on disruptions to cancer care from hurricanes shows that sort of missed care has an impact on survival rates, for example — and the pandemic is stretching out over a much longer period of time than a hurricane. "We've always said we have to do everything immediately in cancer care," but oncologists and patients are having to wait or start other treatments instead as they wait for surgery. For Silver, such delays are excruciating. Her oncologist suggested a new chemo until surgery is possible. But to change the chemo, she needed to get another biopsy, the doctor told her. And then there was a delay in getting that second biopsy because there were few members of the staff available during the pandemic to do it. And that's not all: Insurance approvals take longer now that many agents are working from home, she says. And the chemo center takes fewer patients throughout the day to space the treatment chairs farther apart. The time each delay steals is precious. "In the five-week delay, I had gone from three small tumors to a massive, 7- by 3-[centimeter] tumor that was pushing against the skin," Silver says, fighting emotion. This heartbreaking scenario could play out for many people. "We're only going to realize over the next few months and years about what the consequences of that deferred therapy are," says Ravi Parikh, an oncologist at the University of Pennsylvania. He says recent months forced him to embrace the previously unthinkable — including in-home chemotherapy and patient visits conducted over the phone. Such workarounds, he says, will need to continue. "The No. 1 thing that I'm concerned about is the backlog of cases," Parikh says. "When there's this onslaught of appointments, surgeries, colonoscopies, chemotherapy appointments, it's not going to be at a slow pace." Nor will it be able to happen quickly. Cancer patients with weakened immune systems are at greater risk of infection — and that risk continues, even as states start to reopen. Their risk varies by community even within a region, so doctors will have to weigh when it's safe to operate in their local area. And as they resume widespread treatment, each doctor, medical practice or treatment center will face the challenge of determining who receives care first. The University of Michigan's hospital system is already using a new formula as those decisions arise about who should get priority in treatment — to include factors such as the nature of the disease and its progression, says Michael Sabel, a surgical oncologist and professor. Patients are assigned what the hospital calls an "urgency score," Sabel says. "In many cases, that can include patients being able to get back to work, and the financial strain that's on patients — in addition to just things like, is it cancer and what is the biology of that cancer," he says. Still, the frustrating reality is that COVID-19 will continue delaying care for some time. Silver has set her sights on new goals: to shrink the tumors with the new chemo and to reschedule surgery for the fall. "I hope it works," she says. "It's what I have right now — and I just hope it works."

             Charles Dally and his daughters Emma (center) and Cleo are fostering Frisky the frog from a science classroom at PS 58 in Brooklyn, N.Y. In the pandemic, families are taking on all kinds of unexpected roles. Here's another one: zookeeper. When the New York City schools closed in March, my son's teacher, Mary Pfeifer, sent an email to parents, asking who would be willing to invite the classroom pets into their homes — for the duration. The response was immediate. "It's a very giving community" says Pfeifer, who teaches pre-K through second grade science at PS 58 in Brooklyn. Ms. Pfeifer, as she's known to her students, knows Holly the Russian tortoise, Frisky the frog, and the other classroom companions are in good hands. But that doesn't stop her from thinking about them. "They're pets. I miss knowing what they're doing," she says.

In addition to Holly and Frisky, there's Chubby the frog, as well as an assortment of invertebrates including walking sticks, garden snails, beetles, worms and bugs. "Hands-on time with live creatures is invaluable," Ms. Pfeifer says. With short-term changes becoming long term, the families who welcomed the animals into their upended lives are finding companionship, entertainment and learning opportunities. Chubby the frog

             Bryan Sleeper with his sons, Errol Sleeper, 6, and Oscar Stacke, 8 months. I was quick to enlist our services when I heard Chubby the frog needed a foster home. Since arriving in March, we've discovered a lot about Chubby and the crickets she eats. Chubby gets two daily mists. She breathes through her skin and needs a moist environment to survive. She's nocturnal and likes to soak in her pool at night. We've learned that frogs use their eyeball muscles to swallow, and we were also relieved to learn that it was the pet trade business that nicknamed her species "chubby frog," rather than PS 58 students. When we can find Chubby — she's very good at burrowing into the dirt — my first-grade son, Errol, likes watching her open and close her mouth.

We've been surprised that crickets, considered a hardy pest in houses and gardens, have proven delicate in captivity. And they can be delivered by mail; who knew? Keeping their container free of poo and carcasses is a dirty job that we will not miss when Chubby returns to her forever home. Crickets do have one good quality: They chirp at night, which we all find very peaceful, and will miss when they leave. Holly the Russian tortoise

When the Agha family agreed to take in Holly the tortoise, they didn't know what they were getting into. But over the past two months, Holly has become a source of comfort during the long, unpredictable days of the city's lockdown. "She's a new experience and something the kids can enjoy," says Christine Topalian-Agha, whose 6-year-old son, Aram, is a student of Ms. Pfeifer's.

Aram is Holly's primary caretaker, and the tortoise lives in his bedroom, in a 3-foot container with a bath, plants and bark flooring. He lets her out sometimes to crawl around freely. Aram has written a book about the experience, titled My Life with Holly. "She's given Aram something very special," says Christine, "something [of] his own that he manages and takes care of." "She sleeps a lot more than I thought she did," notes Aram. "I also never knew she was Russian." Though the Aghas' hands are full with work, home-schooling and, for a few terrifying weeks, father Haris Agha's COVID-19 infection and recovery, ­­Christine says they are grateful to have Holly in their lives. When the tortoise returns to PS 58, they plan to get one of of their own. The Log Hotel

The Log Hotel, they learned, does not like broccoli. The Log Hotel, in its terrarium, has found a home next to the Hibberts' hermit crab and the LED light station they use to grow garden plants year-round. "I like that we now have a whole area on the shelves dedicated to ecosystems," says Cadria. Her daughter Beatrice, 7, has been studying the Log Hotel's needs, including what the creatures eat, and she has learned that they like to be sprayed with water throughout the day to keep the soil moist.

             Cleo (left) and Emma Dally play with Frisky the frog on the deck of their apartment in Brooklyn. The Dally family has a few questions about Frisky: Is he missing the other PS 58 classroom pets? Would he like to have more plants in his tank? What will we do with him if we go on vacation? Frisky arrived at PS 58 as a tadpole six years ago and was raised in the classroom along with his mate, Fiona, who died last year, Ms. Pfeifer says. Frisky now lives in a sunny corner of the Dally's Brooklyn apartment. An unassuming amphibian, his behavior has surprised the family a couple times. Every night, dad Charles Dally says Frisky becomes quite noisy. At first he thought Cleo, 9, or Emma, 5, had left the metronome on after piano practice. "Tik tok, tik tok. Now I know it's Frisky," he says. 
                The Dally family doesn't consider Frisky a demanding house guest.

He eats food pellets, and his tank gets cleaned every week or two. Frisky, according to Cleo and Emma, loves playing with his reflection in the walls of his home. "Cleo and Emma get a lot of enjoyment out of him," says Charles. "Especially at the beginning, they watched him a lot. Now, he's a part of the environment, kind of like the furniture." Garden Snails

             Second-grader Violet Goldberg and her brother, Jonah Goldberg, who is in fifth grade, are fostering the garden snails from the PS 58 science classroom. In mid-April, it appeared the garden snails were trying to reproduce. Andrew Goldberg and Gabrielle Paupeck, who took the snails home from PS 58, sent a picture of the activity to Ms. Pfeifer. She confirmed their suspicions. After the tiny, white snail eggs appeared, Ms. Pfeifer received another picture. She advised the family that the eggs should hatch in another two weeks. "I've been trying to get them to lay eggs for seven years," says Ms. Pfeifer. "Obviously, the Goldbergs are doing something right." 
                Snails are easy and low maintenance, the Goldbergs say.

"Occasionally they like a leaf, grape or pepper, but what they really want is carrots," explains mom Gabrielle. "They also eat chalk to make their shells hard," adds 10-year-old Jonah. When asked whether the snails have changed the family dynamic, dad Andrew Goldberg replies, not so much: "We all enjoy the snails, but they're not really a gateway to a dog."

A couple of years ago, NPR investigated that question: Could this pathogen — and others — be revived? A version of this story originally ran in January 2018. Zac Peterson was on the adventure of a lifetime. The 25-year-old teacher was helping archaeologists excavate an 800-year-old log cabin, high above the Arctic Circle on the northern coast of Alaska. They had pitched tents right on the beach. Over the course of a month, Peterson watched a gigantic pod of beluga whales swim along the beach, came face-to-face with a hungry polar bear invading their campsite and helped dig out the skull of a rare type of polar bear. But the most memorable thing happened right at the end of that summer trip. "I noticed a red spot on the front of my leg," Peterson says. "It was about the size of a dime. It felt hot and hurt to touch." The spot grew quickly. "After a few days, it was the size of a softball," he says. Peterson realized he had a rapidly spreading skin infection. And he thought he knew where he might have picked it up: a creature preserved in the permafrost. Nano-zombies or red herrings? In the past few years, there has been a growing fear about a possible consequence of climate change: zombie pathogens. Specifically, bacteria and viruses — preserved for centuries in frozen ground — coming back to life as the Arctic's permafrost starts to thaw. The idea resurfaced in the summer of 2016 when a large anthrax outbreak struck Siberia. A heat wave in the Arctic thawed a thick layer of the permafrost, and a bunch of reindeer carcasses started to warm up. The animals had died of anthrax, and as their bodies thawed, so did the bacteria. Anthrax spores spread across the tundra. Dozens of people were hospitalized, and a 12-year-old boy died. On the surface, it looked as though zombie anthrax had somehow come back to life after being frozen for 70 years. What pathogen would be next? Smallpox? The 1918 flu? The media took the idea of "zombie pathogens" and ran with it. "Climate change ... could awaken Earth's forgotten pathogens," The Atlantic wrote. "Many of these pathogens may be able to survive a gentle thaw — and if they do, researchers warn, they could reinfect humanity." "Scientists are witnessing the theoretical turning into reality: infectious microbes emerging from a deep freeze," Scientific American wrote. But something is a little fishy about these "zombie pathogen" stories: The evidence presented is as holey as Swiss cheese. The key researcher cited is a biologist who studies amoeba viruses, not human viruses. These so-called monster viruses have evolved to live in cold soil, deep underground, not in warm, human flesh above ground. And in terms of zombie bacteria, anthrax is a red herring. Anthrax has been "rising up" from soils all over the world for millennia, even longer. The bacteria survive by hibernating in the ground until conditions are right and then spring back to life. Back in the Middle Ages, it was common to see fields of dead sheep in Europe, wiped out by "zombie" anthrax. The French called these fields champs maudits, or the "cursed fields." Now there are some tantalizing hints that the Arctic is, indeed, a frozen champ maudits, filled with pathogens even more dangerous than anthrax. Across the permafrost — which covers an area twice the size of the U.S. — there are tens of thousands of bodies preserved in the frozen soil. Some of these people died of smallpox. And some died of the 1918 flu — a strain of influenza that swept the globe and killed more than 50 million people. But is there actually any evidence that these deadly viruses could survive a "gentle thaw" and then start a new outbreak? To figure that out, I headed up to the top of the world, where Zac Peterson spent his summer, to see exactly what type of creatures — and diseases — are hiding in the permafrost. I was not disappointed. "We've got a head right here" Up on top of an ocean bluff, Peterson and a few students are on their knees, digging inside a hole that's about the size of a Volkswagen minivan. In 2013, a severe storm ripped off a big chunk of the bluff. Now the 800-year-old cabin is teetering on the edge of a cliff, near the town of Utqiagvik in Alaska. The team is trying to pull off an emergency excavation before the cabin crumbles into the ocean. 
                A team of volunteers rushes to excavate an ancient hunting cabin near Utqiagvik, Alaska, the town formerly known as Barrow.

             Hunters have been using this spot for thousands of years. At one end of the house, somebody was storing fresh kills. "We've got a head right here, and a main body right there," says Peterson, as he points to two mummified seals lying face-up in a soup of thawing permafrost and decaying sea mammal flesh inside the cabin. The seals are starting to warm up. Their organs are seeping out of their bodies and beginning to decay. The whole area smells like a rotting tuna sandwich. Peterson's pants are covered in black, oily goo. 
                In the past few years, severe storms have ripped off big chunks of the Alaska coastline. The white bags are used to try to prevent the ancient log cabin from sliding into the sea.

             The seals have been buried in permafrost for about 70 years. They are incredibly well-preserved. You can see their skin, their whiskers and even something that looks like a flipper. "That's what's so amazing about Arctic sites," says Anne Jensen, an archaeologist with the Ukpeavik Iupiat Corp. who is leading the excavation. "The preservation is amazing," she says. "It's like the animal just keeled over and died right then." Then something even creepier appears in the ice: a human molar. "It's just a tooth," Jensen says. "People lose them all the time. And then just throw them out." Now, this hunting cabin isn't built on a burial ground. Jensen doesn't think any bodies are buried near here. But Jensen is a world expert on excavating human remains from Arctic permafrost. "I've probably dug up as many burials as anybody, " she says. "I would prefer not to be excavating burials. But I've spent a lot of my career doing that." She has excavated everything from individual body parts — one time, she found just an upper arm in the ice, she says — to a massive cemetery, right here along the coast. In the late 1990s, the graves in the cemetery started washing into the sea because this stretch of the Alaska coast is eroding. The local government called Jensen in to save the bodies. She saved dozens. But a few hundred remain, threatened by erosion. Sometimes these mummified human bodies — which can be centuries old — are just as well-preserved as the seals in the log cabin, Jensen says. "The little frozen girl from Uquitavik, she was actually better preserved than the seals," Jensen says. "She was about the age my daughter was at the time, so it was really sad." Buried in the meat cellar with a little sled  Back in 1994, erosion exposed the body of a 6-year-old girl completely encased in ice for about 800 years. "Water had seeped into her burial," Jensen says. "So we took her out as a block of ice." The little girl was carefully wrapped in a duck-skin parka with a fur-trimmed collar. Her parents had buried her with a little sled inside their meat cellar. Her body was so well-preserved that Jensen shipped her to Anchorage so doctors could do a full autopsy. One of those doctors was Michael Zimmerman, a paleopathologist at the University of Pennsylvania who has been studying mummified bodies for 30 years. "When you open up frozen bodies from Alaska, all the organs are right in place and easily identified," Zimmerman says. "It's not like Egyptian mummies where everything is shrunk and dried up." Doctors can easily see why a person died. For the little frozen girl, it was starvation. But Zimmerman has seen infections in bodies excavated from permafrost. In one case, a mummy from the Aleutian Islands seemed to have died of pneumonia. When Zimmerman looked for the bacteria inside the body, there they were, frozen in time. "We could see them under the microscope, inside the lungs," Zimmerman says. But were these "zombie" bacteria? Could they come back to life and infect other people? Zimmerman tried to revive the bacteria. He took a smidge of tissue from the lungs. Warmed it up. Fed it. "But nothing grew," Zimmerman says. "Not a single cell." Zimmerman says he wasn't surprised the bacteria were dead. Pneumonia bacteria have evolved to live in people at body temperature, not cold soil. "We're dealing with organisms that have been frozen for hundreds of years," he says. "So I don't think they would come back to life." But what about viruses — like smallpox or the 1918 flu? "I think it's extremely unlikely," Zimmerman says.  In 1951, a graduate student decided to test this out. Johan Hultin went to a tiny town near Nome, Alaska, and dug up a mass grave of people who had died of the 1918 flu. He cut out tiny pieces of the people's lungs and brought them back home. Then he tried to grow the virus in the lab. "I had hoped that I would be able to isolate a living virus," Hultin told NPR in 2004. "And I couldn't. The virus was dead. "In retrospect, maybe that was a good thing," Hultin added. A good thing, yes. But here's the disturbing part. Hultin tried to capture the 1918 flu virus again, 45 years later. By this time he was a pathologist in San Francisco. He heard scientists were trying to sequence the virus's genome. So at age 73, Hultin went back to Alaska. And he took a piece of lung from a woman he named Lucy. "Using his wife's pruning shears, Hultin opened Lucy's mummified rib cage. There he found two frozen lungs, the very tissue he needed," the San Francisco Chronicle reported. "Her lungs were magnificent, full of blood," Hultin told the paper. At the same time, a Canadian team of scientists went hunting for the 1918 flu virus in Norway. They dug up seven bodies. But none of them were frozen, and the team failed to recover any virus particles. In the 1990s, Russian scientists intentionally tried to revive smallpox from a body in their permafrost. They recovered pieces of the virus but couldn't grow the virus in the lab. All these attempts — and all these failures — make you wonder: Maybe it isn't melting permafrost we should worry about when it comes to zombie pathogens, but what scientists do in the lab. It's not over until the fat seal sings When I finished writing this story in December, I ended it with a faint warning about the dangers of human curiosity. I was convinced that the only way "pathogens" would rise up from the permafrost was if a scientist bent over backward to resurrect the creatures in the lab. The chance of it happening naturally seemed infinitesimally small. But then I received an email from Zac Peterson: "After kneeling in defrosted marine mammal goo ... doctors treated me for a seal finger infection," Peterson wrote. A photo showed a purplish-red infection covering the front of his knee. Seal finger is a bacterial infection that hunters contract from handling the body parts of seals. The infection can spread rapidly into the joints and bones. Sometimes people lose fingers and hands. The doctors never tested Peterson's infection to see if it really was seal finger. It responded well to simple antibiotics — the treatment for seal finger. The only seals Peterson had handled were those in the log cabin. Those seals had been frozen in permafrost for decades. "Even if there's a possibility it was something else," Peterson wrote, "I still tell people that I got infected by an 800-year-old strain of a seal hunter's disease that was trapped in ice." Peterson just might be the first victim of "zombie bacteria" rising from Alaska's thawing permafrost.

             Medical examiners and coroners are the last stop for investigating unexpected deaths, including those who may have died of COVID-19. In April, the Cook County Medical Examiner opened a surge center to handle overflow from Chicago-area hospital morgues. As the coronavirus pandemic has unfolded, all eyes have been on the medical workers and public health disease detectives fighting on the front lines ― and sometimes giving their lives — to bring the coronavirus under control. But as efforts to test for the coronavirus and trace cases continues, medical examiners and coroners play a vital — if often unsung ― role. These "last responders" are typically called on to investigate and determine the causes of deaths that are unexpected or unnatural, including deaths that occur at home. In the early days of the outbreak, a scarcity of tests often hampered their efforts. Now, as that equipment gradually becomes more widely available, these professionals may be able to fill in answers about how people died and if those deaths were related to the coronavirus. And these confirmed cases can also help investigators trace contacts who may also be infected. Those changes won't happen at once or uniformly across the country, experts predict. In addition, an increase in postmortem testing is likely to put coroners and medical examiners in the middle of a debate heating up about the true number of COVID-19 casualties. Determining how many people the virus has killed is an ongoing bone of contention. Some defenders of the Trump administration's response charge that death estimates are inflated, often because they include people who were presumed to have died of the disease but not tested for it. Administration critics counter that the chaotic rollout of testing and treatment led to thousands of needless deaths that aren't represented in the official death toll. Even now, months after the emergence of COVID-19 in the United States, the availability of test kits and testing materials, such as nasal swabs, remains inadequate in many places. Public health experts agree that broad-based testing is critical for people to safely emerge from lockdown and for businesses and other institutions to safely reopen. "Some localities are prioritizing testing sick people over dead people, and that's probably a good decision if they have limited testing available," says Dr. Sally Aiken, the medical examiner for Spokane County, Washington, who is also president of the National Association of Medical Examiners. As availability increases, however, stepping up postmortem COVID-19 testing could uncover important clues about the spread of the virus, experts say. During the pandemic, many sick people have stayed at home and died there rather than seeking help at hospitals overwhelmed with coronavirus patients. In April in New York City, for example, a reported 200 residents died at home each day, compared with 20 such deaths before the pandemic, a spokesperson for the city's medical examiner told WNYC, the local public radio station. Tests were not possible in many of those instances. But with more tests, such cases are now getting attention. "Most of the ones we test are the individuals who die at home," says Gary Watts, the coroner in Richland County, S.C., who is president of the International Association of Coroners and Medical Examiners. If family or friends say the person had symptoms consistent with COVID-19, the coroner's office will typically do a nasal swab to test for the virus, he says. If the test is positive and the office can determine the cause of death without an autopsy, one will generally not be performed. Coroners and medical examiners have similar responsibilities but their backgrounds are often different. Coroners are typically elected officials who may or may not have a medical degree. Medical examiners are typically medical doctors and may have a specialty in forensic pathology. Like Watts, Dr. Kent Harshbarger, the coroner for Montgomery County, Ohio, which includes the city of Dayton, says his office now has enough tests to determine if COVID-19 was involved in suspect deaths, unlike during the pandemic's early days. With more postmortem testing, "you can do better contact tracing," he says. A few medical examiners and coroners are now stepping up testing significantly, performing tests on all the bodies that are brought in, says Aiken. "They're surprised at some of the people who are positive," including suicides and car accidents, she says. One reason for increasing testing is to protect the staff who are handling the bodies, says Dr. Judy Melinek, a forensic pathologist in the San Francisco area and CEO of PathologyExpert. If a body at the morgue is positive for COVID-19, "you want to avoid doing an autopsy unless it's absolutely necessary," Melinek says, because of the risk of becoming exposed to the virus through aerosolized particles or blood. Plus, she noted, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration recommends against performing autopsies in COVID-19 deaths. Even if coroners and medical examiners aren't doing extensive nasal-swab testing on the recently deceased, they can provide vital information later on, some note. It's standard practice to take blood samples from patients who are sent to the morgue, and coroners and medical examiners typically keep blood samples on hand for up to a year. Testing those blood samples for antibodies to the coronavirus, which would indicate a prior infection, could give public health experts a clearer sense of when the virus arrived in the United States and the extent of its spread. It won't identify every undiagnosed infection, since antibodies don't show up until one to three weeks after infection occurs, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. People may die before then. Still, postmortem antibody testing could provide useful information, experts say. "If we can figure out when [the virus] arrived in the U.S., we can figure out a lot more about how this virus came through and was undetected," Melinek says. Going forward, as public health experts and politicians contemplate decisions about reopening the country for business and the possibility of a resurgence of the virus, the more concrete information available the better, experts say. "Postmortem testing is helpful and important when it is balanced by the logistical feasibility of doing it," says Lorna Thorpe, a professor of epidemiology at New York University Grossman School of Medicine. "When politics enters this space, it's nice to have confirmed cases so that it can't be critiqued." Kaiser Health News (KHN) is a nonprofit news service covering health issues.

             Public health officials worry that the mostly low-income and immigrant populations served by community health centers aren't getting proper health care and testing. Community health centers had been at the front lines of health care in the nation's poorest neighborhoods even before the spread of the coronavirus. But in the midst of the pandemic, patients who fear deportation or infection are forcing many centers to close. Public health officials worry that the populations that these centers serve — mostly people with low incomes and immigrants — aren't getting proper health care and testing, may be unable to quarantine themselves and could contribute to spreading the coronavirus to the wider population. "People are worried about COVID-19," says Joslyn Pettway, acting CEO of Covenant Community Care in Detroit, a nonprofit health center. "If patients don't come in for a visit, we lose money." Covenant serves more than 20,000 patients each year through five locations with a staff of about 200. Pettway was forced to furlough about 50 staff members and shut down two full-service dental centers, because dental care is not essential, even though 1,400 patients are on a waiting list. The lack of patients seeking health care is a direct result of Michigan's tough battle against the coronavirus. As of May 18, the state had more than 51,000 confirmed cases, with Detroit registering more than 10,000 confirmed cases and 1,255 deaths, according to Michigan state health data. "Our patient population has been hard hit, no doubt about it," Pettway says. "Those health disparities that we've seen due to COVID, they existed long before COVID. COVID just brought it to light." 
                Joslyn Pettway is acting CEO of Covenant Community Care in Detroit. So far Covenant has tested at least 244 patients for the coronavirus, and it is planning to open a drive-in testing site.

             Joslyn Pettway is acting CEO of Covenant Community Care in Detroit. So far Covenant has tested at least 244 patients for the coronavirus, and it is planning to open a drive-in testing site. There's no better time to argue for affordable access to care for everyone, she adds. The coronavirus pandemic shows why we need to keep pushing to expand access to medical care for everybody, regardless of the person's status, Pettway says. "Nobody is excluded from the impact of COVID. And so people who are unable to access care for a variety of reasons, they increase the spread of the virus," ultimately impacting all of us, she says. Community health centers, like Covenant Community Care, were launched in 1965 as part of President Lyndon B. Johnson's Office of Economic Opportunity, propelled by the civil rights movement and the War on Poverty. Their aim then, as it is now, is to provide comprehensive and affordable primary care to medically underserved populations, regardless of their insurance or immigration status and their ability to pay for services. Pettway says it's not atypical for Covenant patients to delay care, especially preventive care. To many low-income residents, preventive health care is a luxury. They either can't take the time away from work or lack transportation or child care. "They were already struggling before the pandemic," she says. Covenant has been hit hard by the pandemic. Only one site is open for in-person urgent visits, such as testing for the coronavirus, newborn checkups or an abscess that needs to be drained. The other four locations are currently serving patients virtually. Using $997,490 from the federal CARES Act, Pettway invested in telehealth software in March to keep the Covenant centers running. "We are working very hard not to shut down locations," she says. "The need is massive in Detroit."

             Family nurse practitioner Sage Davis set up the telehealth program for Covenant Community Care. Before the coronavirus, Sage Davis, a family nurse practitioner at Covenant, relied heavily on the full panel of a patient's vital signs, lab work and physical exam. Now she doesn't have that information to make decisions about a patient's treatment. Davis is making different calculations, along with her patients. "What's the risk of possible exposure going to medical facilities? And then, what's the risk if we don't get lab work right now or we don't get this imaging right now?" she asks. "It takes a lot of clinical judgment to determine if this is something that we really do need to get right now or if it's something that can wait. We really are looking at the patient in front of us and just treating our patient." Davis, who is managing the center's transition to telehealth, says she constantly reminds her patients to call back if things get worse or change. A decision made today gets reviewed and assessed, she says. "I do have options for sending people to an in-person visit if they need it," and that gives Davis peace of mind. One of the silver linings of telehealth, Davis says, is that before COVID-19, patients stepped out of their environment to come into the center for care. "Now we're in their environment in a way," which Davis says is helpful. For example, let's say a patient with diabetes and joint problems walks up the stairs slowly and unsteadily to get a thermometer. "I can see in the video the amount of time and effort it takes her to climb that set of stairs," she says. "Whereas in my office, I'm cognizant of her joint problem, but I don't see her climbing stairs." Around the U.S., 1,400 health center organizations across 14,000 locations in rural and urban areas serve more than 29 million people, most of whom are low income, are uninsured or on Medicaid and Medicare, or are immigrants, according to the National Association of Community Health Centers. Almost 2,000 sites have shut down since the pandemic hit. "Financially, these centers are getting a blow in this pandemic," says Dr. Ron Yee, chief medical officer for the National Association of Community Health Centers. "When you cut your visits by half, that's going to change your revenue, even though you may make up for it a little bit with virtual visits," Yee says. 
                Dr. Edgar Chavez of Universal Community Health Center in Los Angeles says that it's scary to see people relax social distancing rules. "Just because the government says you can open, you can go back to work, doesn't mean the virus has disappeared," he says. "The virus is still around and can infect people."

             Dr. Edgar Chavez of Universal Community Health Center in Los Angeles says that it's scary to see people relax social distancing rules. "Just because the government says you can open, you can go back to work, doesn't mean the virus has disappeared," he says. "The virus is still around and can infect people." Virtual visits don't get reimbursed at the same rate as regular in-person visits. For example, he says, an online visit is currently being reimbursed at between $13 and $93, while community health centers receive between $100 and $150 in reimbursement for an in-person appointment. But it's not only the coronavirus crisis that concerns Yee. Community health centers operate on short-term funding, and it expires on Nov. 30, unless Congress acts. "I'm very worried about the future of our centers," Yee says. And doctors and nurses are struggling in this crisis. "Right now health centers are projected to lose about $7.6 billion between April and September to get through this, to stay whole so that we can be up and running when we get through this pandemic," he says, adding that this projection is based on a 60% decline in visits systemwide. Community health centers are playing a vital role in this pandemic. As of May 1, more than 300,000 patients had been tested for the coronavirus. In California, a large number of patients at community health centers are recent immigrants, says Dr. Edgar Chavez, who serves as medical director at Universal Community Health Center, a cluster of three centers in South Los Angeles. Chavez says patients fear that being tested for the coronavirus will land them on a list to be deported. This mistrust of the government and reluctance to seek medical care stem from the Trump administration's public charge rule, Chavez says. Chaves is working virtually, and his staff is calling patients and checking in on them for depression and anxiety as well as to see if they need to be tested for anything. "Telehealth can only go so far with chronic care. You still need that lab data point," he says with a sigh. "We are going to have a lot of people that go without Pap smears, go without mammograms, go without all these different things that we use to improve and maintain their health." Chavez says he worries about the health of his patients. "People aren't eating well. They are not exercising, and they are anxious," he says. "I fear that we are going to be hit with a huge wave of uncontrolled patients with chronic care-related conditions, especially diabetes, hypertension and heart disease." Chavez's voice trails off. "It is very tough," he says. "We're doing the best that we can, but we're going to be facing a pretty, pretty tough situation." The need was already massive before this public health crisis hit and it will get worse after the pandemic is over, health care providers say.

             Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin speaks during a virtual hearing of the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday. Mnuchin and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell spoke about the rescue package passed by the Congress in March. Updated at 12:37 p.m. ET The Senate Banking Committee took its first look at spending under the massive CARES Act, which Congress approved in March to provide assistance to individuals, businesses and local governments affected by the coronavirus pandemic. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin were pressed by senators about their stewardship of specific aspects of the approximately $2 trillion relief package at Tuesday's remote hearing. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., criticized both the treasury secretary and the Fed for not including stronger requirements that businesses borrowing from the central bank keep workers on the payroll. "We're in a situation where 35 million Americans have filed for unemployment," Warren said. "You're in charge of half a trillion dollars. You're boosting your Wall Street buddies, and you are leaving Americans behind." Mnuchin disputed Warren's characterization and said the conditions attached to the Fed programs had been negotiated with Congress. Powell reiterated his view that Congress may have to authorize additional spending to prevent long-term damage to the economy. "What Congress has done to date has been remarkably timely and forceful," Powell said.  "I do think we need to take a step back and ask, over time, 'Is it enough?' And we need to be prepared to act further. And I would say we are if the need is there," Powell added. Mnuchin, however, has been less open to new spending, saying federal lawmakers should wait to assess the effects of the four measures already approved by Congress before appropriating more funds. The hearing came a day after a four-member panel appointed by Congress reported that none of the $46 billion allocated in the CARES Act for loans and loan guarantees for the airline industry has been spent and that relatively little of the $454 billion in program for loans to businesses and state and local governments has been disbursed by the Federal Reserve Board. In his prepared testimony, Mnuchin appeared to dispute the oversight panel's findings. He says Treasury has "committed up to $195 billion in credit support under the CARES Act. We have the remaining $259 billion to create or expand programs as needed, as we continue to monitor a variety of economic sectors closely." He also says $25 billion in payroll support has been provided to the airline industry. Powell said the Fed's Main Street lending facility for midsize businesses, municipal lending and other programs should be up and running by the end of May. Democrats on the panel sent Powell and Mnuchin a letter Monday asking that they "further expand loan eligibility requirements, including quickly adopting a viable option for non-profits who are facing acute challenges as a result of the virus," and provide greater flexibility on the loan terms. Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., wrote that "all taxpayers will be better off to the extent more businesses can access affordable financing, keeping doors open, workers on payroll, and avoiding costly bankruptcies, through the remainder of the public health shutdown." In his prepared testimony, Powell told the panel that the Fed has made changes, including reducing the minimum amount and raising the maximum amount of loans that business can ask for, changes that he says "should help the program meet the needs of a wider range of employers that may need bridge financing to support their operations and the economic recovery. We will continue to adjust facilities as we learn more," he said. Mnuchin responded to criticism that the Treasury Department has been too timid. "We are fully prepared to take losses," he said of the seed capital that the department is providing to support lending by the Fed.

             Southeast Exposure tour manager Jared Gross pushes off from his dock in Ketchikan, Alaska. The company is expecting a significant downturn in kayak rentals this summer because of the lack of cruise ships. It's quiet on the docks in Ketchikan. In this Southeast Alaska town that depends on cruise ships to make ends meet, that's worrisome. Patti Mackey is the head of the Ketchikan Visitors Bureau. Any other May, she said, these docks would be abuzz. "There would be several thousand people in Ketchikan at the same time getting ready to see the town — and spend their money," Mackey said. It was supposed to be a record year. More than 1.2 million cruise passengers were projected to visit. They would have pumped $190 million into Ketchikan's economy. Those tourists would have supported numerous businesses throughout the region — from souvenir shops to jewelry stores to tour operators. Across Southeast Alaska, tourists were forecast to spend nearly $800 million this summer, supporting 8,000 jobs in a region with 70,000 full-time residents. Tour companies were taking reservations. Seasonal retailers had ordered their summer stocks, Mackey said. Then the world changed. Cruise lines suspended operations as the coronavirus spread quickly aboard ships. Voluntary suspensions turned mandatory when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a "no-sail order." It's set to expire July 24. But it's unclear whether any of the big ships will visit Ketchikan this year — Carnival and subsidiaries Holland America and Princess Cruises have canceled Alaska sailings through the end of the year. All told, nearly 80% of Southeast Alaska's sailings are gone. That means a lean season lies ahead for businesses like Southeast Exposure, which offers kayak and zipline tours on the north side of Ketchikan. "I'd say almost 100% of our business is from the cruise ships," Southeast Exposure manager Jared Gross said. "We're trying to figure out where we can get new business — hopefully some local business this summer." 
                Cruise ship berths in Ketchikan, Alaska, sit empty on May 13 — a day when two ships carrying a total of more than 4,500 passengers were originally scheduled to arrive.

             Cruise ship berths in Ketchikan, Alaska, sit empty on May 13 — a day when two ships carrying a total of more than 4,500 passengers were originally scheduled to arrive. It won't come close to replacing revenue from tourists. Gross is offering a seasonlong kayak rental for $200. Tours for cruise ship visitors cost closer to $100 per day. Fortunately, he said, his 34-year-old family business has low overhead. He's confident Southeast Exposure will survive the shutdown to see 2021. Many others won't. The Ketchikan Visitors Bureau asked 75 local businesses how long they could hang on without tourists in town. Only about a quarter said they could endure until next summer. Cruise ship tourism isn't just the cornerstone of Ketchikan's economy — it also underpins its municipal finances. Sales taxes collected on whale watching trips, some floatplane excursions and souvenir T-shirts help pay for its police and fire departments. Port fees go toward paying off hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of upgrades to the city-owned downtown cruise ship docks. Over the past few decades, Ketchikan has moved from timber to tourism. Nowhere is that more evident than at Ketchikan's old wood pulp mill. "This really was the economic heart of not only Ketchikan, but really of Southeast [Alaska]," said John Binkley, standing at the end of a partially completed cruise ship dock in Ketchikan's Ward Cove. He's part of a group of investors partnering with Norwegian Cruise Line to turn the shuttered mill into a $50 million cruise ship terminal. Until last year, Binkley was the Alaska cruise industry's representative-in-chief. His family has been in the tourism business for 70 years, and he's seen the business ebb and flow. He said he's confident visitors will return. "I think there's ... something within us as humans that we want to travel. We want to go out and experience new things and different things," Binkley said. "I think that will always be there." For now, however, there are a lot of questions as to how Southeast Alaska businesses and towns will make ends meet.

             A worker passes a sign at a restaurant along San Antonio's River Walk that has reopened. As businesses reopen around the U.S., many workers are worried for their health. As businesses reopen, many Americans being called back to work say they don't feel safe — especially those who work in restaurants, hair salons or other high-contact jobs. "With people eating food, not having masks on, with servers having to touch their plates and their silverware, there's just absolutely no way to keep the servers safe," says Lindsey, a waitress in Iowa. She has been out of work for two months. But this week, the pub-style restaurant she works at is reopening. "I don't feel comfortable going back yet. I don't feel comfortable at all," she says. Lindsey wants only her first name used because she's worried about losing her job. She says her restaurant is setting up rules for increased hand-washing and disinfecting and is spacing tables 6 feet apart. But even with that, she thinks it's too soon to reopen. "I believe that restaurants are one of the most unsafe places," Lindsey says. "If we can do delivery and takeout, that's totally fine." But she says serving people dinner isn't an essential task right now and it feels too risky. Still, if your employer offers you your job back and you refuse it, generally speaking, you're not supposed to be able to keep collecting unemployment benefits. But there are strategies and special protections that workers should know about — in particular people with health conditions and parents whose children's school, day care or summer camp is shut down. 1. Talk to your employer. Andrew Stettner, a worker-protection expert at the Century Foundation, a progressive think tank, says people in Lindsey's situation should start by talking to their employer. "And say, 'You know what, I don't feel comfortable coming back right now. But maybe in two weeks I might feel comfortable,' " Stettner says. " 'Can I wait?' " He says you might say you want to wait, talk to co-workers and hear how the safety measures are going as things get rolling again. He says your employer might not be able to hire everybody back right away anyway and so might agree not to call you back to work yet. "And as long as they say that's OK," Stettner says, "your unemployment benefits won't stop." That's something any worker can try. 2. There are special rules if you have an underlying health condition. "My big concern is that most workers don't understand their rights," says Michele Evermore of the nonprofit National Employment Law Project. She says if you have, say, diabetes, heart disease or an immune deficiency and your doctor advises against going to work during the pandemic, Congress voted to let people in that situation collect unemployment. "If you have an underlying condition," Evermore says, "first contact your employer and explain why you can't return to work." She says to then explain the situation to your state's unemployment office. And, she says, "you should be eligible to remain on unemployment assistance." Evermore says the decision is made by the state unemployment office. A letter from a doctor should help, she says. 3. If you can't get child care, you should be able to stay on unemployment. Many parents are stuck right now if they have a job that can't be done remotely from home. They can't return to their place of work because with schools, day cares and summer camps closed, they have no one to watch their kids. Congress approved help for them, too. Chai Feldblum, a Washington, D.C., lawyer who advises businesses as they reopen, tells many employers to consider letting parents in this situation not return to work. "If someone is unable to work because of child care needs, because a school, a place of care has closed," Feldblum says, "then that person is eligible for unemployment." Feldblum says that in addition to unemployment benefits, some parents may be eligible for 12 weeks of paid leave mandated by Congress, though that will depend in part on the size of the business. Businesses that must provide this leave can then hold on to tax money they would otherwise have sent to the IRS and use it to cover the cost of paid leave for parents, she says. 4. But just being afraid is not enough to stay on unemployment. Getting back to the safety issue, Feldblum says just feeling unsafe is not enough to stay on unemployment. "No. If you're just scared about going to work, you have to go to work in order to get paid," she says. 5. What if your workplace seems particularly unsafe? Stettner and Evermore say if your workplace is not taking basic safety precautions that similar businesses in the area are and you can document that, you might qualify to refuse to go back to that job and stay on unemployment. The argument you'd be making is that the workplace is not meeting the prevailing conditions of work in the area. For example, Stettner says, if there are "five grocery stores in town and four are providing their employees with masks and gloves and are sanitizing properly, but you work for the fifth and they're just not doing that, you can say, 'No, look, this is not meeting the prevailing conditions of work.' " But, Stettner says, that puts the worker in a difficult position: having to point a finger at the employer and argue this issue with the state unemployment office. Meanwhile, Evermore, of the National Employment Law Project, would like to see clear and enforceable mandatory safety rules coming from the federal government — including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. But so far under the Trump administration, she says that's not happening. "That's the whole problem," Evermore says. Without those kinds of bright mandatory lines being drawn at the federal level, "it's going to be the states that are opening up too quickly that are also going to be deciding what suitable work is." She says hundreds of groups, including hers, are asking for better federal guidance on worker safety. Loading...  Don't see the graphic above? Click here. With traffic dramatically down in recent months, the United States is in the middle of an accidental experiment showing what happens to air pollution when millions of people stop driving. The air is clearer. But the pollution declines aren't nearly as large as early indications suggested, according to an NPR analysis of six years of Environmental Protection Agency data. In some cities, the amount of one pollutant, ozone, has barely decreased compared with levels over the past five years, despite traffic reductions of more than 40%. Ground-level ozone, or smog, occurs when the chemicals emitted by cars, trucks, factories and other sources react with sunlight and heat. NPR analyzed more than half a million air pollution measurements reported to the EPA from more than 900 air monitoring sites around the country. We compared the median ozone levels detected this spring with levels found during the comparable period over the past five years. Our analysis revealed that, in the vast majority of places, ozone pollution decreased by 15% or less, a clear indication that improving air quality will take much more than cleaning up tailpipes of passenger cars. In cities such as Los Angeles, stubbornly poor air quality during the coronavirus lockdown underscored how vast fleets of trucks are a dominant source of pollution. In industrial cities like Houston, refineries and petrochemical plants spew considerable air pollution. And in Pittsburgh and across a swath of the eastern U.S., much of the air pollution still comes from burning coal. Scientists say those cities, where air pollution often exceeds federal health standards, will likely have to change the way they generate power, manufacture goods and move those goods around if they hope to have healthy air. "I think it's a really important [question] to think about: What can we learn from decreases in traffic pollution?" says Jenna Krall, a statistician and air pollution expert at George Mason University. "It will give us more information about what these pollution mixtures could look like [with] fewer people driving." 
                Freeway traffic was light and the air was relatively clear in Los Angeles on April 6.

             Los Angeles — trucks overtake cars Initially, the virtually nationwide lockdown appeared to have dramatically positive results. In early April, NASA published satellite images of pollution disappearing over New York City. After California issued a stay-at-home order in mid-March, greater Los Angeles saw the longest stretch of clean air that had been documented in decades. In Los Angeles, the skies seemed to clear just as rarely seen images of nearly empty freeways began to make headlines. It was welcome news for an area with some of the highest levels of ozone in the country, often exceeding federal health standards. Breathing polluted air for long periods of time can damage the lungs and make it more difficult to fight respiratory disease. Ozone pollution is especially detrimental to children and elderly people and those with asthma, emphysema and other respiratory illnesses. The COVID-19 pandemic adds another respiratory disease to that list. But the cleaner air wasn't just about reduced traffic.  Loading...  Don't see the graphic above? Click here. A series of rainstorms swept through Southern California in March, which helped remove pollutants from the air. But as the weather warmed up in late April and early May, the air quality worsened, even hitting the "very unhealthy" warning category from the EPA. "There was a lot of pressure on us to come up with the answer that everyone wanted to hear, which is that the COVID-19 measures have cleaned the air in Southern California," says Philip Fine, deputy executive officer at the South Coast Air Quality Management District, which regulates air quality in greater LA. Overall, ozone levels were down only 14% in late March and April compared with the same period over the previous five years, according to NPR's analysis. The modest drop points to a fact air regulators have long emphasized: Cars are not the biggest air pollution problem in Los Angeles. "I've read a lot of newspaper articles over the past couple weeks that have said if only we can have people telecommute one day a week across the entire basin, our air quality problems will be solved," says Fine. "And unfortunately, it's not that simple." As passenger cars have gotten cleaner, they've become a relatively smaller source of pollution. Heavy-duty transportation, such as trucks and buses, now accounts for the largest source of nitrogen oxides, which form ozone, in the area. Major ports in Los Angeles and Long Beach handle more than 30% of the nation's shipping container traffic, requiring a vast network of ships, trucks and trains coming in and out of the region.  Loading...  Don't see the graphic above? Click here. Emissions from those sources, combined with hot and stagnant weather, cause air pollution to hit dangerous levels during the summer, which puts the region out of compliance with federal air standards. Low-income communities are hit the hardest. While activity at the region's ports has slowed with the pandemic, trucks have largely stayed on the roads to ensure that goods are arriving in stores. At the end of April, truck activity was down only about 8% across California, according to the American Transportation Research Institute. In a strange wrinkle, the reduction of one pollutant can also make ozone slightly worse. Cars and trucks produce nitrogen oxides, also known as NOx. While that pollutant helps form ozone, under some conditions it can temporarily break down ozone molecules. So with less NOx being emitted recently, ozone hasn't been suppressed as much. "Small reductions in NOx actually increase ozone," says Cesunica Ivey, assistant professor of chemical and environmental engineering at the University of California, Riverside. "So we're just going to have to be more aggressive with our sustainable transportation solutions." Severe Los Angeles smog in the 1950s and '60s prompted California to ultimately pass some of the most aggressive air quality regulations in the country. The state still sets its own tailpipe emissions standards for cars, apart from the federal government. The Trump administration is now seeking to revoke California's legal authority to do so. California also has an ambitious target for putting 5 million electric cars on the road by 2030. That could help lower emissions because instead of burning gasoline, those cars would run on electricity, largely generated by solar, wind and hydropower in the state. Now California is crafting a similar policy for trucks. State regulators are expected to vote on rules in June that would require truck manufacturers to sell all-electric or fuel-cell trucks in the state — from delivery trucks all the way to tractor-trailers. The policy would begin in 2024, requiring that 5% to 9% of sales be electric, depending on the type of truck. By 2035, it would be up to 40% to 75% of sales. Some truck manufacturers have pushed back against the proposal, saying the market for selling electric trucks hasn't developed yet. Supporters say higher sticker prices would be offset by fuel savings over time, and when paired with California's other efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, could potentially save thousands of lives by improving the air. "We don't need a pandemic to breathe cleaner air," says Yifang Zhu, professor at the Fielding School of Public Health at the University of California, Los Angeles. "There is a sustainable way for a society to achieve a cleaner world in the future. We need to do more than we're doing right now." 
                Water vapor rises from a coal powered power plant stack. Pollution from burning coal affects a larger area than vehicle emissions.

             Water vapor rises from a coal powered power plant stack. Pollution from burning coal affects a larger area than vehicle emissions. Pittsburgh — coal on display Less car traffic makes pollution from coal more obvious in the broad swath of Midwestern and Eastern states where the majority of coal-fired power plants are still operating. Compared to passenger cars, burning coal releases large amounts of air pollution, including nitrogen oxides and small particulate matter, or soot. Nowhere is the role of coal in air pollution more evident than in Allegheny County, Pa., where Pittsburgh is located. The county is home to a major coking plant that uses coal to make the fuel for the blast furnaces in steel factories, as well as a coal-fired power plant. Both continued to operate during the lockdown along with other steel facilities clustered in and around the county. Between March 15 and the end of April, NPR's analysis found ozone levels in the Pittsburgh area dropped about 9%, compared with 14% in Los Angeles. Across the coal-intensive Ohio River Valley, the analysis concluded that in major cities, ozone dropped only between 3% and 8%. Scientists say that's not surprising because coal is the dirtiest of fossil fuels. "Unlike a lot of the eastern part of the United States, there's not much, if any, coal-fired power plant production in California," says Emily Elliott, a geochemist at the University of Pittsburgh who studies nitrogen oxides. Pollution from burning coal also affects a larger area than vehicle emissions, which means modest air pollution reductions in East Coast states may partly be because of their location downwind of coal-fired facilities. "If you think about a power plant that has a tall smokestack, those emissions are going high aloft in the air and they're going to travel long, long distances compared to a vehicle tailpipe that's close to the ground," Elliott says.

             The Houston metro area is home to the largest concentration of petrochemical facilities in the country. Residents of Houston, despite a 40% reduction in local traffic, did not breathe significantly cleaner air during the lockdown. Houston — the petrochemical industry's role Coal is not the only industry culprit for poor air. NPR's investigation found that residents of Houston did not breathe significantly cleaner air during the lockdown, despite a 40% reduction in local traffic. Houston experienced an 11% decrease in ozone. Daily ozone levels in Houston were still high enough to trigger an air quality warning in the city in mid-April. The Houston metro area is home to the largest concentration of petrochemical facilities in the country. Refineries and chemical plants are major emitters of not only nitrogen oxide, but sulfur dioxide, which also contributes to smog and haze. NPR's analysis also found only modest decreases in Houston's soot pollution during the lockdown. The median amount of soot in the air decreased by just 13% in Houston compared with the previous five years, according to air monitoring sites that reported data between March 15 and the end of April. Air monitoring sites that reported comparable data in greater Los Angeles showed a 30% decrease. There was not adequate data to compare soot levels in Pittsburgh. Chronic exposure to soot is associated with shorter life expectancies, lung cancer, diabetes and low birth weight and can exacerbate respiratory and cardiovascular illnesses. Regulatory rollbacks could make industrial pollution more severe in the future. The Trump administration announced this spring that it will not strengthen limits on soot, despite an assessment published earlier this year by EPA scientists that found that a stronger standard would save lives. An accidental experiment Scientists around the country say reduced car traffic offers them an unexpected opportunity to study how cars, trucks, factories and power plants contribute to air pollution and to test the assumptions that go into pollution models. One such study is already underway at Texas A&M University, where atmospheric scientist Gunnar Schade examined preliminary air data for the city of Houston and found that levels of particulate matter increased slightly in at least one location in Houston during the lockdown. "That was a somewhat surprising result, that particulate matter is not going down at all," he says. "We assume that car traffic does contribute to [small particulate pollution]. It has in the past." Schade's analysis, which has not been peer reviewed and is still being updated as more data becomes available, also suggests that particulate pollution decreased more in residential parts of Houston than it did in industrial areas. Schade says it's too soon to be sure whether that means the pollution came from the industrial sites — he needs more data. Despite decades of research and a relatively robust set of satellites and ground-based air monitors, there are still sizable holes in our understanding of how different sources of air pollution contribute to overall air quality, according to Elena Craft, the director of climate and health at the Environmental Defense Fund in Texas. The pandemic could help make scientific models of what are called emissions inventories more accurate. "If you take all the cars off the road and it doesn't put a dent in your emissions inventory, then probably cars are not making up a lot of that inventory," explains Craft. "But if, on the other hand, you take all the cars off the road and air quality is great, then you may tweak the models."

             Dr. Max Lazarus, a medical resident at a hospital on Long Island, N.Y., is one of some 130,000 medical residents in the U.S., many of whom have found themselves on the front lines of the COVID-19 pandemic. The coronavirus is leaving a lasting impression on a generation of young doctors. In the U.S., there are some 130,000 medical residents — doctors in their final years of training after medical school — who make up a vital part of the workforce. Now a global pandemic has become the centerpiece of their training. Many are pulling long hours in emergency departments and intensive care units treating patients infected with the coronavirus, all while witnessing the health care system under unprecedented stress. Their schedules are transformed. Family members must keep their distance. And some of the hallmarks of their clinical training suddenly feel tenuous. Many recognize the pandemic as a formative moment, both for health care and their own careers. Some say it's also magnifying existing concerns about labor and mental health among doctors in training. 'Nothing is working' Before the coronavirus crisis, Dr. David Lin, a second-year medical resident at the Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City, felt comfortable working in the intensive care unit. Lin already knew how to manage a patient on a ventilator, when to adjust the settings, what to do if the person's kidneys needed help. So much changed for him the day that coronavirus patients first streamed into his hospital, though. "Every person that rolled in: tubed, unstable, respiratory failure, COVID ... anyone, young, old," he says. "It was just a deluge." From then on, Lin was treating these critically ill patients all the time, week after week, as New York City hospitals saw a crush of coronavirus patients in March and April. Lin soon discovered that some of the clinical know-how he had accumulated over years of training no longer applied in the same way to COVID-19. Instead of improving, patients would linger in the ICU for weeks, their recovery uncertain. "You are trying to do something, and nothing is working," he says. "Now whenever I see someone intubated, you just know, 'Oh my God, they are probably going to die.' " Day after day, Lin had the unsettling experience of leaving the hospital unsure of whether his efforts to help patients actually made a difference. "It has just been incredibly disheartening," he says. Another challenge is that even Lin's attending physicians — the seasoned doctors who train him — don't have all the answers either. "These leaders in critical care who I respect so much, they're telling me like, 'We don't know,' " he says. "That's terrifying." "It reminds you there are always going to be things in medicine that you will never know," Lin says. In Baltimore, Dr. Martha Frances Brucato, a second-year resident in pediatrics and internal medicine, says much of her education has emphasized that family members should be closely involved in a patient's care. But now hospitals generally bar visitors because the coronavirus is so contagious.

             "The really hard part of our jobs right now is how alone our patients are by necessity," she says. The pace is different too. She can't rush to a patient's bedside without first putting on layers of protective gear: "That immediacy is such a part and parcel of ICU care, typically." For many residents, the risk to their own health has never felt so immediate either. Before working in the ICU with COVID-19 patients, Brucato made sure to remind her husband of her own medical wishes. "Remember that I have a living will," she told him. "I would want to be ventilated as long as there was a chance for meaningful recovery." That does not mean Brucato hesitated to be on the front lines of the pandemic. In fact, she volunteered for the assignment. Dr. Brendan McEvoy, an emergency medicine resident in Chicago, also jumped at the chance to work on COVID-19 in the ICU. Then he caught the virus. "There were a lot of people that were very concerned for me," he says. It was nerve-wracking initially, he says, because he had seen otherwise healthy young people on ventilators during his shifts. Soon after his recovery, he was put on a dedicated intubation team in the hospital. "I hope we are going to look back at this like, 'How were we all not better prepared?' " Pandemic magnifies labor concerns  For some residents, the pandemic is amplifying long-standing concerns about working conditions. "It is really bringing to light a lot of the ways that residents have been mistreated for years," says Dr. Amy Plasencia, executive vice president of the Committee of Interns and Residents, a union representing more than 17,000 doctors in training. Before the pandemic, the Committee of Interns and Residents was pushing for a bill of rights that focused on better pay, sick-time policies and other protections for residents. "Now is the time that we most need those protections," says Plasencia, a resident at a hospital in Brooklyn, N.Y. "Because residents are really at the forefront doing so much of this work, they are in very large numbers becoming ill." Generally, residents are reluctant to speak publicly out of concern that doing so could jeopardize their job and professional future. Since the pandemic began, more are taking to social media to air concerns about working conditions. Medical residency is essentially a prolonged apprenticeship that generally stretches from three to seven years. Residents are expected to put in long hours as part of their education. The average salary is about $60,000 per year. At the University of Washington, the union representing doctors in training is wrestling over a contract with the hospital system in an effort to get better pay and benefits. "People can't work 80 hours a week, see really horrible things all day [and] not have access to mental health care, without having some sort of burnout," says Dr. Zoe Sansted, who is vice president of the University of Washington Housestaff Association. Sansted, a family medicine resident in her third year, was assigned to work in the ICU as the pandemic spread in Seattle. She says many residents are eager to work extra hours and be on the front line. "These are wonderful instincts," she says. "Doctors are obsessed with professionalism, but it's also ripe for exploitation." COVID-19 takes emotional toll Before the pandemic, Dr. Murad Khan was already a bit nervous about his internal medicine rotation. Khan is a psychiatry resident in his first year, known as an internship, at Yale New Haven Hospital. Suddenly his rotation coincided with a surge of COVID-19 patients. Rules were changing constantly. At first, he says, it wasn't clear what residents would be asked to do or whether there would be enough personal protective equipment.

             "Initially, things were pretty frantic," Khan says. "I actually spent a lot of the first couple weeks having a hard time sleeping before going into work." Khan says he found himself on edge, concerned that a COVID-19 patient would crash and he wouldn't know how to respond. "There is something traumatic just about not knowing how sick a patient might get at any moment," he says. Khan is much more comfortable working with coronavirus-infected patients since those early days of the pandemic in Connecticut. But he recognizes the psychological toll of caring for these sick patients, often being the only connection between them and their families. "You are having these conversations on a regular basis. Do we want to focus on comfort care? Or do we want to focus on trying to make them live more?" he says. Khan says the coronavirus has only underscored existing problems in American health care, from racial health disparities to the demands placed on medical residents. "There was already an issue around how much residents work and how much they are supervised and whether or not that's good for their mental health," he says. "That's even worse now." For many residents, the legacy of the coronavirus may be the emotional weight of so much unmitigated loss. Dr. Max Lazarus, a resident at a hospital on Long Island, N.Y., went into emergency medicine exactly so he could respond to crises. He remembers pushing stretchers around the lobby of Bellevue Hospital as a volunteer in the emergency room during Hurricane Sandy. "This is what I signed up for," he says. "It forces you to grow in a way that I don't think anything else could."

             But Lazarus says nothing could fully prepare him to watch patients call their family members before going on a ventilator. "You tell them that hopefully they will wake up but there is a chance they may not," he says. "It's not the way anyone should die, alone on a ventilator." Lazarus, 29, still thinks about two patients he treated early in the pandemic — one was a bit younger than he is, the other a bit older. "And they died," he says. "They really stick out."

             Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin speaks during a coronavirus task force briefing in April. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Jerome Powell, chair of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, will remotely address the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday regarding the disbursement of hundreds of billions of dollars in coronavirus relief aid. In written testimony released on Monday (below), Powell described the pandemic as having caused "a level of pain that is hard to capture in words."  He added: "As a society, we should do everything we can to provide relief to those who are suffering for the public good." Powell has called on Congress to do more to meet the Fed on its historic lending, and to expand relief funding to Americans. So far, Congress has passed an unprecedented $3 trillion in aid to temper the economic blow from the crisis.  The Democratic-led U.S. House last week approved $3 trillion in additional relief, including nearly $1 trillion for state, local and tribal governments, and hazard pay for essential workers and families. Republicans have called the measure a Democratic wish list, and the White House has issued a veto threat. The testimony comes a day after a congressional oversight panel released its first report outlining its supervision of lending programs. The report found that the Treasury has not yet paid out any of the $46 billion earmarked for businesses of national security and the U.S. airline industry, which has faced particular devastation during the pandemic.

             Volunteers for the grassroots network Columbia Community Care organize donated groceries and household items at one of five distribution sites in Howard County, Maryland. In her normal life, Erika Strauss Chavarria is a high school Spanish teacher in Columbia, Maryland. But when schools closed due to the coronavirus pandemic, she moved her classes online, and found another way to help. In March, she founded Columbia Community Care, a grassroots network of neighbors helping neighbors. What started as a Facebook group with about 40 members has become a network of more than 4,000 people. The group runs five sites where it distributes donated groceries and household items, and two pop-up food pantries where volunteers can safely shop to deliver groceries to families who can't leave their homes. Every day, people post offers of help — from free books and bicycles to donations of fruits and vegetables. One of the group's taglines is "choose compassion." All over the world, people like Erika are mobilizing to help each other through the pandemic. At the same time, though, we also see another kind of response: People placing their own self-interest above everything else, sometimes to the point of putting others in harm's way. There are those who have even tried to profit from the pandemic, like the man in New York accused of stockpiling N95 masks to sell at an inflated price. Such stories of alleged wrongdoing are often what get our attention. So we take action to curtail the selfish bad actor. Legislators pass laws that take aim at transgressors. Regulators and police departments come up with rules that punish lawbreakers. Parents and teachers discipline truants. But what about the helpers like Erika — have we forgotten them? What are the costs when we design our public and economic policies to focus on the crooks and wrongdoers? Sam Bowles, a behavioral economist and author of The Moral Economy: Why Good Incentives Are No Substitute for Good Citizens, says it's a mistake to focus on the bad, and to ignore the good in people. "Self-interest in markets and in relations with government isn't going to be a good way to organize the future," says Bowles. "[COVID-19] tells us that we have to rely on other things — communities, neighborhoods, obligations we have to each other — which are not self-interested. That's what we're seeing is fundamentally getting people through this." This week on Hidden Brain, we explore how laws written to govern the lawless end up changing the behavior of the lawful — for the worse. And we ask, what would happen if public policy was designed to care less about the man who sold his masks for a profit? What would happen if we put people like Erika at the center of our thinking instead?

                Shoppers began showing up earlier this month at International Plaza in Tampa, Fla. Mall business has been slow to pick up, with a lot of people still reluctant to venture out.

             Shoppers began showing up earlier this month at International Plaza in Tampa, Fla. Mall business has been slow to pick up, with a lot of people still reluctant to venture out. Marshall Gilmore finally got what he'd been waiting for this month when the state of Mississippi allowed him to offer table service again at his restaurant, the Harvest Grill in Meridian. Still, many of his tables sit empty, even at limited capacity, and he makes most of his money offering curbside food pickup. "People are just a little apprehensive about getting out in public. This was a once-in-a-lifetime scare that we all just went through. So everyone's a little scared," Gilmore says. States are slowly beginning to take steps to restart their economies, allowing retail stores, parks and even hair salons to reopen, usually under tightly controlled conditions. But analysts say that businesses and their customers, through their actions, will decide when the economy opens up again. In an April news conference, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis pledged to get his state "back on its feet by using an approach that is safe, smart and step by step." But officials still need to convince people it's safe to go out again. "If they don't feel safe, they're not going to go to a restaurant, they're not going to go out, they're not going to go to retail," Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine told MSNBC on May 11. The U.S. economy has undergone a massive slowdown over the past two months, with businesses closing their doors and laying off some 36 million workers. Schools, churches and theaters have shut down en masse. Much of this began to happen in late February, well before most governors had issued lockdown orders, because people became afraid to go out. "The fear itself might prevent them from actually going to work, or they might be forced either to stay at home because they are sick or because they have to attend [to] someone in their families or households who is sick," says Felipe Lozano Rojas, an instructor at Indiana University's School of Public and Environmental Affairs. Lozano Rojas has studied the relationship between a state's lockdown orders and how well its economy has fared. In a recent paper, he said there's little evidence that states with more aggressive social distancing guidelines have seen more layoffs. "It suggests that maybe reducing these social distancing requirements and reopening schools and allowing businesses to go back may not have as big of an effect in restarting the economies at an individual state as you might have otherwise thought," adds his co-author, Bruce Weinberg, an economics professor at Ohio State University. In other words, governors didn't shut down their states' economies all by themselves, and they can't reopen them alone either. That's been borne out in states that have begun easing social distancing guidelines. News reports have shown pictures of crowded bars in Wisconsin and busy beaches in Florida, but businesses that have reopened say customers have been slow to return, at least so far. For example, some states have begun allowing shopping malls and retail stores to reopen this month; traffic so far has been light, says Neil Saunders, who follows the retail industry for the firm GlobalData. "I think some mall owners and retailers have been taken by surprise as to how slow this build is," Saunders says. "Consumers are very concerned about coming out. And some are just not confident to go out to locations and shop like they used to." COVID-19 is not the first coronavirus outbreak we've experienced. There was SARS in 2003, and then MERS in 2012. If coronaviruses have been around for years, why don't we have a vaccine already?  The answer partially has to do with economics. Turns out that the market for emergency vaccines is weird. So weird that it involves top-secret chicken flocks, the creation of a new government agency and an annual stockpile of upwards of 900,000 chicken eggs. This is the story of what it takes to produce a national vaccine supply. Listen to the original Planet Money podcast episode here!

             Dmitry Dolgorukov poses for a re-creation of a self-portrait by Vincent Van Gogh. A Russian art project intended to ward off the lockdown blues has become a viral sensation on Facebook as pent-up Russian speakers from across the globe reenact paintings to pass the time amid the coronavirus pandemic. Called Izoizolyacia — roughly meaning "Art Isolation" — the Facebook group says it's for people with "limited movement and unlimited fantasy." It invites members to re-create masterworks but with one important restriction of its own: Use only what you have at home. In little over a month, the community has grown to more than a half-million members. Using household items, food, raided wardrobes and a familiar Russian-inflected sense of irony, members have produced dizzyingly creative remakes of everything from European masterpieces to Soviet agitprop and coronavirus-influenced memes.

             Olga Blytova, an oral surgeon based in St. Petersburg, Russia, created a self-portrait inspired by a statue of ancient Egypt's Queen Nefertiti. The project started with a few friends in Moscow looking to entertain each other as the city began enforcing self-isolation rules as the virus took hold in April. "I took a picture of my husband, tagged it Izoizolyacia, and asked a few others to join," says Katerina Brudnaya-Chelyadinova, 38. Her husband, Dmitry Dolgorukov, donned a hat and painted beard for the project's first post — a quick riff on Vincent Van Gogh's Self-Portrait with Straw Hat from 1887. The post got a few laughs, sure, but there was little sense of what was to come. Some friends responded. Then more submissions trickled in from across Russia. Soon posts were coming in from Ukraine, Georgia, Israel, Western Europe, North America and beyond. "We did nothing. It was completely organic," says Brudnaya-Chelyadinova. She quickly assembled a team of volunteers to help curate an online exhibition that defies national boundaries but shares a certain cultural affinity.

             Sasha Nikolov, a resident of Kyiv, Ukraine, makes for a surly stand-in for Valentin Serov's iconic Girl With Peaches. It's a stark departure from the sort of Russian global influence that's been grabbing negative headlines in recent years. "Art Isolation" (welcomely) stretches across borders as Russian speakers holed up in different parts of the world share creations — and jokes — that have clear broader appeal. But at their core, the creators tap into a Russian-influenced talent for laughing and creating through hard times — at the deprivations of the Soviet Union, the chaos that followed its demise and now the evolving restrictions of our coronavirus age. "It's hard to put a finger on it, but it's a certain Russian know-how — funny, ironic and depressing all at once," says Kira Yastrebova, 36, a group member whose family moved from Moscow when she was 11 to a tightknit Russian immigrant community in a suburb outside Minneapolis.

Her submission: a remake of Salvador Dalí's 1925 painting, Figure at a Window. Only, her refrigerator substitutes for Dali's lush waterside view. "Everyone's commenting that 'this represents the sentiments of our times!' " Yastrebova tells NPR. "To be honest, I didn't have that deep a thought. I just didn't have a window." Indeed, the best entries move beyond clever art cosplay and tap into the zeitgeist. "I'd just gotten off a six-hour shift," says Olga Blytova, 44, an oral surgeon in St. Petersburg, Russia, who — with a tilt of her medical shield upward — transformed herself into ancient Egypt's Queen Nefertiti and paid tribute to medical workers fighting the virus. "To each their own crown," she wrote in an accompanying post. Others joke on the familiar shortages — such as toilet paper — or the reality of simply being cooped up for too long. "I was bored and I had peaches," says Sasha Nikolov, a resident of Kyiv, Ukraine, who makes for a surly stand-in for Valentin Serov's Girl With Peaches from 1887.

             Elena Nikolaenko re-created Raphael's Sistine Madonna with her husband, mother and three children. Take Elena Nikolaenko, 36, who moved from Russia's Far East to Toronto five years ago. She re-created Raphael's 16th-century Sistine Madonna with her husband, mother and three children. "My mother came up with the idea while stuck here because of the travel bans,"  Nikolaenko says. "She noticed the picture had the same number of people as we had in our family." Nikolaenko adds that her 11-year-old son, Timofei, "has been amazed by the response," now at more than 79,000 likes. In the age of Instagram, it's no surprise that visual artists, celebrities and influencers have also gotten in on the act. But it's average people — and ordinary bodies — who often generate the most laughs and, often, likes. "I'm not a very visual person," says Karina Terekhova, 49, an information technology specialist who moved from her native St. Petersburg to Helsinki in the 1990s.

The poster reads, "Let Monday come fast and then it's back to work!" That included her husband of 20 years, Vasily Simonenko. "It was bothering me. His face? Where had I seen it before? He reminded me of something," Terekhova tells NPR. A quick search on Google, and she had her answer. She soon coaxed Simonenko to strip to a T-shirt and strike a sporty pose from a Soviet work poster of their childhood. "Let Monday come fast and then it's back to work!" reads the poster's slogan — a perfect mashup of Soviet agitprop and today's pandemic-induced financial anxieties. "At first my friends said, 'Why are you reposting that old poster?' And I said — 'Look again! It's my Vasily!' " Terekhova says. "It's magic. Sometimes even I can't tell it's him."

             A patient arrives to pick up medication for opioid addiction and is given hand sanitizer at a clinic in Olympia, Wash. The pandemic is changing the distribution networks and supplies of street drugs across the United States, authorities say. As the country went into quarantine in March, many of Joseph DeSanto's opioid-addicted patients in Orange County, Calif., told him their supply was drying up because drug dealers in the area were worried about a border shutdown and were retreating to their hometowns in Mexico. "So we lost a lot of our larger dealers that supplied the smaller dealers," says DeSanto, an addiction specialist. But within days or weeks, many of his patients had found new sources of heroin and pain pills, with dangerous results. "When they had to use another dealer, they would be getting a different strength. So they weren't really sure of how they should measure it and how much they should use. So we started seeing a lot of overdoses and a lot of overdose deaths in the first couple of weeks of the pandemic," DeSanto says. There is no national data yet on the pandemic's impact on drug supply and overdose rates in the United States, but experts in addiction and law enforcement say availability and prices of illegal drugs have changed in different areas of the country. And as drug users adjust to new patterns of use, that's creating a patchwork of new overdose risk as well. The availability of street drugs varies by region, says Uttam Dhillon, acting administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration. Methamphetamine has increased in price in most areas as supply apparently decreased, and cocaine and heroin have seen a similar uptick in price. Much of this is because of travel restrictions. Dhillon says some of the normal transit routes, through Asia or South America, have shut down. He also points to dramatic decreases in car and foot traffic to and from Mexico, the main source of America's heroin. "The ability of these drug-trafficking organizations to move across the Southwest border we believe may be having an impact," Dhillon says. Increased police presence and stay-at-home orders have also discouraged dealers and buyers from meeting in public, he says. That appears to have affected demand for the street drugs in Cambridge, Mass., where, according to Jack MacEachern, opioid supply remains pretty dry. "No one's out on the street; it's just not out there," says MacEachern, who runs a Salvation Army residential drug recovery program there. He says it's not just that dealers aren't getting shipments; their customers also can't get money to buy them. "If you have a dope habit and, you know, the way you hustle — make your money — is shoplifting, well, stores are closed," he says. MacEachern, who has been in recovery from opioid addiction for two decades himself, says relapse and overdose rates near him have decreased — at least for now. A decreased supply of drugs might sound good, but it also increases the risk of overdoses in the future, especially as many states reopen for business. During the lockdown, the Recovery Centers of America based in King of Prussia, Pa., saw an influx of lower-income patients unable to buy opioids who then sought treatment to avoid painful withdrawal, says the treatment chain's chief medical officer, Heidi Ginter. People who reduced their use of opioids may be at especially high risk if they start using again. "We may see additional potency of drug available on the street and then people whose tolerance has changed based on what they've been using," Ginter says. "So we're pretty fearful about that." That concern has led to talk of increasing distribution of naloxone, a medication often also referred to as Narcan, which is used to try to reverse an overdose. Elinore McCance-Katz, who heads the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, supports such measures but also points out that the virus has complicated the ability to treat people with naloxone. "In some areas, first responders such as law enforcement do not want to administer naloxone because they're afraid of being exposed to the coronavirus," she says. "I found that very concerning because the option is that the person dies." She says her agency is now sending training teams into communities to help them safely administer the naloxone while also managing the risk of virus exposure.

             Then-President Obama and then-President-elect Donald Trump shake hands during a transition planning meeting in the Oval Office at the White House in November of 2016. With Joe Biden on the ballot, so is the legacy of Barack Obama, and it appears we're about to see a throwdown between the last president and the current one — and their polar opposite worldviews. Amid criticism of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, President Trump has been falsely laying blame on Obama for leaving the "cupboard bare" when it comes to the national stockpile of emergency medical supplies and equipment. And lately, Trump and conservatives have been running with allegations of potentially criminal activity by Obama administration officials for their handling of surveillance that later led to the investigation and guilty plea of Michael Flynn, Trump's three-week national security adviser. (The Department of Justice now wants to drop its case against Flynn.) In the past week, Trump has tweeted "Obamagate" (on its own, as a retweet or as a hashtag) 18 times. Three times, he's tweeted simply "Obamagate!" with nothing else. OBAMAGATE! Neither Trump nor White House officials have been able to identify a specific crime, but it sure helps fire up the base.  Obama, for his part, seemed to reply with one word of his own Thursday: "Vote." Vote. And then, on Saturday, he had more words during two virtual commencement addresses. "[T]his pandemic has fully, finally torn back the curtain on the idea that so many folks in charge know what they're doing," Obama told graduates of historically black colleges and universities. "A lot of them aren't even pretending to be in charge." Then, when speaking to graduating high school students, he said: "Do what you think is right. Doing what feels good, what's convenient, what's easy — that's how little kids think. Unfortunately, a lot of so-called grownups, including some with fancy titles and important jobs, still think that way — which is why things are so screwed up." Wow. And a week earlier, when talking to former officials from his administration, leaked audio revealed that Obama called Trump's handling of the coronavirus an "absolute chaotic disaster" and an example of what happens when a "what's in it for me" mindset "is operationalized in our government." Pressed about Obama's remarks Sunday, Trump said he hadn't heard them, but noted, "Look, he was an incompetent president, that's all I can say, grossly incompetent." Welcome to the 2020 presidential campaign. Reelections are always a referendum on the sitting president. But with Biden, Obama's vice president, at the top of the Democratic ticket, it's somewhat of a referendum on Obama, too. And there's reason for Trump to want — or even need — to try and take Obama down a few pegs. Currently, Obama is among the most popular politicians in the country — and one of the highest-polling political figures (besides his wife, Michelle.) It's a clear and stark choice offered up to voters — and one Trump seems to want front and center. He even tweeted at Republican Senate Judiciary Chair Lindsey Graham, who says he wants to hold hearings on the Flynn case, to call Obama to testify.  "Do it @LindseyGrahamSC, just do it," Trump tweeted. "No more Mr. Nice Guy." If I were a Senator or Congressman, the first person I would call to testify about the biggest political crime and scandal in the history of the USA, by FAR, is former President Obama. He knew EVERYTHING. Do it @LindseyGrahamSC, just do it. No more Mr. Nice Guy. No more talk! Graham responded, telling reporters he thinks that would "be a bad precedent" to compel a former president to testify and would "open up a can of worms." "I understand President Trump's frustration," Graham said, before warning, "but be careful what you wish for. Just be careful what you wish for." 1. Coronavirus death toll approaches 90,000: About 90,000 people are now confirmed to have died from COVID-19 in the United States, and though new cases are slowing, the country is still on pace for 100,000 deaths from the coronavirus before the end of the month. That slowing of new cases is good news, but with two-thirds of states significantly relaxing stay-at-home restrictions, experts are concerned about a potential resurgence.  Loading...  "We're seeing a decline; undoubtedly, that is something good to see," Jeffrey Shaman, an epidemiologist at Columbia University, told The New York Times. "But what we are also seeing is a lot of places right on the edge of controlling the disease."  Another good sign, though: New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo tweeted on Sunday that his state now has "more testing capacity than New Yorkers are using." And he wants not only symptomatic New Yorkers to get tested, but also those who "have been in contact with someone with COVID." That's a first step in what experts say is one of the most important things to do to try and contain the virus — test as many people, including those without symptoms, as often as possible.

             President Trump and Vice President Pence look on as a video plays of New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo giving a press conference in April. 2. Will the Senate make a push for another relief package? Health versus the economy has been the tension since the beginning of the lockdowns. Unemployment has hit almost 15%, the highest since the Great Depression. And as deaths spiked in April, 20 million jobs were lost. Congress has passed four relief packages; the Democratic-led House has passed another, but Senate Republicans — and the White House — have balked at a fifth major package.  "We have not yet felt the urgency of acting immediately," Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said last week.  On Tuesday, there could be more clarity on the state of the economy and what more the administration is planning to do to support people and the economy in the coming weeks when Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell appear before the Senate Banking Committee, as required by the CARES Act. 3. Watching for fallout from inspectors general firings: The firing of the State Department's inspector general, Steve Linick — announced on a Friday night, which is where bad news goes to be buried in Washington — is raising more questions than answers. Linick is the fourth inspector general the Trump administration has sought to remove in the past six weeks. A Democratic congressional aide told NPR's Michele Kelemen that Linick was looking into Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's conduct. The move triggered Republican Sens. Mitt Romney, Susan Collins and Chuck Grassley to question Trump's motives. Romney said the move "chills" the IGs' essential independence and called the moves "a threat to accountable democracy." Collins said Trump had not provided "the kind of justification for the removal ... required" by law. Grassley pointed out that "written reasons" are "required" and that "A general lack of confidence simply is not sufficient." But what does the Republican Senate do to maintain the accountability that they say Trump is threatening or not abiding by? So far, during the Trump presidency, it's done little to hold him in check. 4. Senate Republicans move ahead with Hunter Biden probe: On Wednesday, the Senate Homeland Security Committee will vote on a subpoena to Blue Star Strategies. That's a company that worked with the Ukrainian energy company Burisma, which hired Biden's son Hunter to sit on its board. Republican senators are looking into whether Blue Star "sought to leverage Hunter Biden's membership on the board of directors for Burisma." Call it the impeachment backlash.  With Romney signaling he will vote in favor of the subpoena, it is expected to pass, NPR's Philip Ewing and Claudia Grisales report. 5. Supreme Court opinions Monday: The Supreme Court is expected to issue opinions Monday. We are keeping an eye out for an LGBTQ employment discrimination case, as well as whether the court thinks the Trump administration acted lawfully in shutting down the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program. When the DACA case was argued last fall, the court's conservative majority appeared it would go along with the Trump administration. Both of these decisions could be released at any time in the next few weeks. "After much reflection, I've concluded that circumstances don't lend themselves to my success as a candidate for president this year, and therefore I will not be a candidate." — Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan announcing via Twitter the end of his short-lived Libertarian bid for the presidency. There was much Democratic hand-wringing that Amash could cost Biden votes, especially in Michigan.

             Casa de Salud clinicians, staff and health apprentices socially distance outside their New Mexico clinic. The facility is one of many social safety net clinics that haven't yet received pandemic-related funding and are now on the brink financially. Casa de Salud, a nonprofit clinic in Albuquerque, N.M., provides primary medical care, opioid addiction services and non-Western therapies, including acupuncture and reiki, to a largely low-income population. And as with so many other health care institutions that serve as a safety net, this clinic's revenue — and its future — are threatened by the COVID-19 pandemic. "I've been working for the past six weeks to figure out how to keep the doors open," says the clinic's executive director, Dr. Anjali Taneja. "We've seen probably an 80% drop in patient care, which has completely impacted our bottom line." In March, Congress authorized $100 billion for health care providers to compensate them both for the extra costs associated with caring for COVID-19 patients and for the revenue that's not coming in because of interruptions in the usual sorts of care they provide. Clinics, hospitals, doctors' practices and others have been required to stop offering most nonemergency services, and many patients are afraid to visit health care facilities. But more than half that money has been allocated by the Department of Health and Human Services, and the majority of it so far has gone to hospitals, doctors and other facilities that serve Medicare patients. Officials said at the time that this was an efficient way to get the money beginning to move to large numbers of providers. That approach, however, has left out a large swath of the health system infrastructure that serves the low-income Medicaid population and children. Casa de Salud, for example, accepts Medicaid but not Medicare. State Medicaid directors say that without immediate funding, many of the health facilities that serve Medicaid patients could close permanently. More than a month ago, bipartisan Medicaid chiefs wrote to the federal government asking for immediate authority to make "retainer" payments — not related to specific care for patients — to keep their health providers in business. "If we wait, core components of the Medicaid delivery system could fail during, or soon after, this pandemic," wrote the National Association of Medicaid Directors. So far, the Trump administration has not responded, although in early April it said it was "working rapidly on additional targeted distributions" for other providers, including the clinics, physicians and other staff that predominately serve Medicaid patients. In an email, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services said officials there will "continue to work with states as they seek to ensure continued access to care for Medicaid beneficiaries through and beyond the public health emergency." CMS noted that states have several ways of boosting payments for Medicaid providers but did not directly answer the question about the retainer payments that states are seeking the authority to make. Nor did it say when the funds would start to flow to Medicaid providers that do not also get funding from Medicare. The delay is frustrating Medicaid advocates. "This needs to be addressed urgently," says Joan Alker, executive director of Georgetown University's Center for Children and Families in Washington, D.C. "We are concerned about the infrastructure and how quickly it could evaporate." In the administration's explanation of how it is distributing the relief funds, Medicaid providers are included in a catchall category at the very bottom of the list, under the heading "additional allocations." "To not see anything substantive coming from the federal level just adds insult to injury," says Todd Goodwin. He runs John F. Murphy Homes in Auburn, Maine, which provides residential and day services to hundreds of children and adults with developmental and intellectual disabilities. He says his organization — which has already furloughed almost 300 workers and spent more than $200,000 on expenses related to COVID-19, including essential supplies such as masks and protective equipment that will not be reimbursable — has not been eligible for any of the various aid programs passed by Congress. Goodwin's organization gets most of its funding from Medicaid and public school systems. It has tapped a line of credit to stay afloat, he says, "but if we're not here providing these services, there's no Plan B." Even providers that largely serve privately insured patients are facing financial distress. Dr. Sandy Chung is CEO of Trusted Doctors, which has about 50 physicians in 13 offices in the Northern Virginia suburbs around Washington, D.C. She says about 15% of the group's funding comes from Medicaid, but the drop in private and Medicaid patients has left Trusted Doctors "really struggling." "We've had to furlough staff, had to curtail hours, and we may have to close some locations," Chung says. Of special concern are children — because Medicaid covers nearly 40% of them across the United States. Chung, who also heads the Virginia chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, says that vaccination rates are off 30% for infants and 75% for adolescents, putting them and others at risk for preventable illnesses. The biggest rub, she adds, is that with the economy in free fall, more people will qualify for Medicaid coverage in the coming weeks and months. "But if you don't have providers around anymore, then you will have a significant mismatch," she says. Back in Albuquerque, Taneja is working to find whatever sources of funding she can to keep the clinic open. She secured a federal loan to help cover her payroll for a couple of months but worries what will happen after that. "It would kill me if we've survived 15 years in this health care system, just to not make it through COVID," Taneja says.

Classes have moved online. Like so many sectors of the U.S. economy, higher education is taking a hit from the coronavirus pandemic. In March, Congress set aside more than $14 billion to help colleges and universities weather the outbreak. Here's where most of that money has gone and why many colleges are holding out for more: The coronavirus rescue package, known as the CARES Act, created three buckets of funding for higher education: $12.5 billion to help with coronavirus-related expenses for schools that participate in federal financial aid; $1 billion for minority-serving institutions, including historically black colleges and universities; and a smaller pot of nearly $350 million for colleges that didn't get much from those first two buckets and still had "significant unmet needs." The largest bucket — that $12.5 billion — was designed to be the main vehicle for getting funds directly to colleges and students. The U.S. Department of Education allocated this money to colleges using a formula that favors institutions serving full-time, low-income students. According to the department, it has distributed more than $10 billion to colleges so far. The CARES Act says schools have to give at least half of that money — more than $6 billion — directly to students whose lives have been disrupted by the pandemic and are having trouble making ends meet. Schools are required to publicly report what they've done with the money. But there isn't much guidance on what these emergency grants for students should look like, and it's up to schools to figure out how to distribute the funds.  "The fact is, to give somebody emergency aid is actually pretty difficult," Sara Goldrick-Rab, a professor of higher education and sociology at Temple University, told Inside Higher Ed. That may be why some universities have yet to begin the process of handing the money out. Eastern Michigan University, which was allotted nearly $14 million in federal aid, said that as of mid-May it still hadn't distributed any money to students because it was working on plans to do so. The law allows institutions one year to give out the money, and EMU plans to have a program in place by late summer or early fall, according to a statement.  And there's another wrinkle: Three weeks after the CARES Act was signed into law, the Education Department issued guidance that said only students who are eligible for federal student aid programs can qualify for these emergency grants. That means, according to the department, international students and undocumented students — including those who are protected under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program — are not eligible for any emergency aid.  In a statement to NPR, the department said this was how Congress wrote the law: "There is no persuasive legal support for the proposition that Congress intended the CARES Act to create an entitlement for DACA recipients and others who are otherwise ineligible for Federal public benefits." Democratic lawmakers have expressed concern about the guidance and the impact it will have on immigrant students. And at least one college system says the new guidance is illegal: Earlier this month, California Community Colleges filed a federal lawsuit against Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, calling the aid restrictions "arbitrary" and "unlawful." From the beginning, higher ed leaders have said the $14 billion lawmakers set aside in the CARES Act wouldn't be enough to save the country's colleges and universities. The American Council on Education, a higher education lobbying group, has called the money "woefully inadequate" and said schools would need about $46.6 billion more.  On Friday, House lawmakers passed a Democratic proposal that would put about $37 billion more toward higher education. Most of that money would go to governors to distribute to public colleges, and about $10 billion would go to schools with pandemic-related needs. The money is part of the $3 trillion HEROES Act, which Senate Republicans have already said they won't support.

             World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus speaks during a press conference on January 30, 2020, in Geneva. The World Health Organization's annual oversight convention will be held by teleconference beginning Monday, as the worst pandemic in modern history continues around the globe. The 73rd annual World Health Assembly typically brings together representatives from the WHO's 194 member states in Geneva to discuss a wide range of health topics. However, this year's meeting will be held by teleconference for the first-time ever. It will also be much more focused — on the novel coronavirus that's infected more than 4.5 million people, killed 300,000, crashed the global economy and shows no sign of going away on its own. "It's probably the most important assembly in their history," says Paul O'Brien,  vice president of policy and advocacy for Oxfam America. "We have a global pandemic. We have half a billion people at risk of falling into poverty. And we need the World Health Assembly to come up with the core solutions. And that is getting a vaccine out, manufactured, distributed and freely available to everyone as soon as possible," he says. Oxfam America is part of a global effort for what the organization calls the "People's Vaccine." The goal is to get countries to work together to rapidly produce a vaccine and agree to make it universally available.  The issue of an inoculation against COVID-19 is expected to dominate the WHO's assembly. But O'Brien isn't convinced that the WHA will reach an agreement on one. "The challenge right now is the leadership challenge," O'Brien says. "[Countries] are not agreeing. They're not delivering the level of ambition that this crisis needs." Helen Clark, the former prime minister of New Zealand, is one of 50 current or former heads of state who've signed on to the People's Vaccine campaign.  "Without a vaccine, we will never live normally again," Clark says. "I want to live normally again. Every American wants to live normally again. Every person everywhere wants to live normally again. That's why it's so critical to have this," she says, adding that the World Health Assembly is a key moment in building the solidarity needed for this initiative.  "As fellow citizens of planet Earth, we're all in this together," Clark says. But some other plans for a COVID vaccine have not necessarily embraced planetary solidarity and appear to have been driven by national and commercial interests. For example, the U.S. last week announced Operation Warp Speed to develop a coronavirus vaccine for "American patients" and "the American people." Despite calls for a vaccine, its development isn't guaranteed. And it's also not clear that a road map to developing one will emerge from the World Health Assembly. Like any United Nations gathering, with representatives from nearly 200 countries, getting consensus on any issue can be difficult. This year things are particularly difficult as the pandemic and economic collapse have exacerbated the geopolitical rivalry between the world's two largest economies. Georgetown University law professor Lawrence Gostin sums up the diplomatic tension at the World Health Assembly this way: "There are two naughty children in the room," he says of China and the U.S. "They're both really big and they're both bullies." The Trump administration has attacked China and the World Health Organization over their handling of the coronavirus pandemic, accusing them of covering up the seriousness of the initial outbreak in Wuhan. The WHO disputes the accusation. China has countered by pushing a conspiracy theory claiming that the virus may have been introduced into its territory by the U.S. military. Ahead of the World Health Assembly, U.S. diplomats have spent far more time calling for Taiwan to be allowed to attend the meeting as an observer than about global efforts to confront the pandemic. As the number of coronavirus cases ratchets up, U.S. and Chinese officials have engaged in a twitter war over whether or not officials from Taiwan, which Beijing sees as a rogue province, can be at the meeting. "If [the U.S. and China] can set aside their differences, stop blaming one another, and actually join forces for constructive good, we could see enormous progress coming out of the World Health Assembly," Gostin says. "But if they fight publicly and privately and if they block each other's initiatives, I think we're going to just get a stalemate. It'll be an enormous lost opportunity at the World Health Assembly."

             Seniors line up in cars with their families in the main drive of Webster County High School in Dixon, Ky., waiting to pick up their diplomas outside of the school one at a time. Like almost all schools across the U.S., county high school officials had to adapt this year's graduation ceremony because of the COVID-19 pandemic. It's graduation season. But thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic, ceremonies are likely to be anything but typical for the class of 2020. For seniors at Webster County High School in Dixon, Ky., that meant a no-contact, drive-through ceremony. On Friday, 146 graduates and their families lined up in vehicles — many decorated with streamers, paint and balloons — at the school, each waiting for their chance to drive up to the entrance. Once there, the rules were simple: exit your family's car, walk up the red carpet, pick your diploma up off the table, pose for a quick picture and go back to your car. No handshakes. No hugging. No contact whatsoever — even with the handful of school administrators standing more than six feet away. Eighteen-year-old Ali Avery Jr., who goes by A.J., was one of the seniors who made this unusual walk to get his diploma. A few days before the ceremony, which was live-streamed on YouTube, he told NPR that he was shocked when first heard he wouldn't get to receive his diploma in front of a crowded gymnasium. "I didn't expect [COVID-19] to hit Webster County that fast," he said. "It doesn't seem real until it actually affects you." Avery was also really looking forward to an in-person graduation because he had been voted by his classmates to give the commencement speech. "To see my parents look at me, just to see their faces when I walk down and get my diploma," he said. "I think that's a real emotional moment for everybody and now we don't get that."

             Ali Avery Jr., who goes by A.J., stands in the back of his family's pickup truck in the driveway of his home. His family decorated their vehicle for the drive-through ceremony. But after Friday's ceremony, during which he drove through in his family's red four-door pickup truck decorated with a huge banner noting his athletic and scholastic achievements, Avery's tune had changed. He was now acting like, well, someone who had just graduated high school. "I feel great, it was bigger than I thought it would be, more people came out," he said. "It was just amazing." For Webster County and its roughly 13,000 people, graduation is a big deal. There's only one high school, fed by the quintessential small, rural towns that dot the county nestled in the rolling hills of Western Kentucky. Once the drive-through ceremony ended, graduates returned to those towns to parade. They were greeted by friends, neighbors and family who, despite the rainy evening, lined the main thoroughfares to cheer them on.  Principal Jarrod Hankins said that because Webster County High School is a "multigenerational school," the community had to be involved in the altered graduation ceremony plans.  "Most of the grandparents went to school here, the parents went to school here, so the kids are going to school here," he told NPR. Furthermore, it's typical for nearly 50% of a graduating class not to go to college, Hankins said, instead going straight into a trade or, until recently, the coal mines. "This is the highest level of education that some students are going to have," he said. "So that's a special moment for that family." A.J. Avery, who is headed to college in the fall, said, in the end, his graduation was actually very special. (And he did get to make the commencement address, it was just prerecorded.) "It gave me goosebumps just hearing people call my name. Just feeling the love and support of the community was just amazing," he said. "They truly did something marvelous and unforgettable."

             Unemployed people wait outside the state Labor Bureau in New York City in 1933. The current economic crisis has drawn comparisons to the Great Depression, but experts say this downturn should be shorter. With the U.S. economy in free-fall, a lot of forecasters have been digging deep into the history books, looking for a guideposts of what to expect. Often, they've turned to the chapter on the 1930s.  "Clearly people have made comparisons to the Great Depression," said former Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke.  "It's not a very good comparison," he cautioned. Bernanke, who is a student of the Great Depression, says that crisis was triggered by a financial meltdown and made worse by bad policy choices, including the decision by his Fed predecessors to raise interest rates.  Perhaps most importantly, the Depression dragged on for a dozen years. While Bernanke doesn't expect to rebound from the current crisis in the next six months or so, he doesn't see it stretching out indefinitely, either.  "If all goes well, in a year or two we should be in a substantially better position," Bernanke told an audience at the Brookings Institution last month. That optimistic view is supported by a different historical example from more than a decade before the Great Depression: the 1918 flu pandemic, after which the U.S. economy bounced back relatively quickly. "I think there is quite a lot to be hopeful for," said Carola Frydman, an economic historian at the Kellogg School of Management.  The so-called Spanish flu pandemic killed an estimated 50 million people worldwide, including hundreds of thousands in the U.S.  It also prompted some of the same "social distancing" measures we've adopted against the coronavirus, with shuttered bars, schools and churches. Still, the economic fallout was "mostly modest and temporary," Frydman wrote. And the U.S. enjoyed strong growth in the decade that followed. She believes that could happen this time as well. "As soon as people feel confident again interacting and being able to go about their business, I would not expect the economic fallout to last a lot longer than that," Frydman told NPR.  Of course, no one's certain how long it will take for people to feel comfortable shopping or traveling again — or how many businesses and families might go under in the meantime.  In 1918, government spending on World War I helped make up for some of the lost private demand, Frydman said. No one is advocating another world war.  But Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said the federal government might have to spend more than the trillions it's already shelled out to keep businesses and families afloat.    "Additional fiscal support could be costly but worth it if it helps avoid long-term damage and leaves us with a stronger recovery," Powell said during an online forum sponsored by the Peterson Institute for International Economics.  Other government policies — including protectionism — could hamper the recovery. President Trump has long advocated higher trade barriers. He's getting less resistance thanks to the pandemic. "These stupid supply chains that are all over the world — we have a supply chain where they're made in all different parts of the world and one little piece of the world goes bad and the whole thing is messed up," Trump said during an interview with Fox Business this past week. "I said we shouldn't have supply chains. We should have them all in the United States."   Here the Great Depression does offer a useful lesson. In the 1930s, the U.S. and other countries turned their backs on trade, adopting steep tariffs in an effort to prop up their Depression-scarred economies. It backfired.  "And that, economists have come to believe, contributed to how long the Great Depression actually lasted," said Chad Bown of the Peterson Institute for International Economics. "It made it very, very difficult for countries to grow their economies again and use trade to help them get there."  Bown acknowledges that protectionism is a natural reflex at a time like this, but he warns it's counterproductive. The coronavirus does not have to touch off another Great Depression, but with misguided policy, it could.

             Signs in English and Spanish outside a hospital in West Reading, Pa., advertise visitor restrictions as a precaution against the spread of COVID-19. When Mary Henderson, a 63-year-old woman with Down syndrome, died in a Boston-area hospital last month, her family says she was confused and alone. Her siblings wanted it to be different. She had tested negative for COVID-19, but the hospital set tight restrictions on visitors, a step common in states and hospitals around the country, to prevent the spread of the virus. Henderson had Alzheimer's, an issue for as many as 50% of people with Down syndrome in their 50s and 60s, and as a result had difficulty speaking clearly and often got confused. During other recent hospitalizations, family members and staff at the group home where she lived would visit to comfort her but also help communicate with doctors. In the hospital this time, Henderson pulled out her IV and her oxygen tube. Nurses in the ICU eventually tied large mittens to her hands to stop her.  "It made my heart ache not to be able to be there for Mary," says her older brother Dick Henderson. "Any other time she was in the hospital, I was there every single day to make sure everything was going all right," says her sister, Kathy Hines. Henderson died April 13, without her family, at the Norwood Hospital in Norwood, Mass., the same hospital where she'd been born. Many people with disabilities and elderly people who have difficulty communicating rely on family members or a direct service professional to help them get medical care.  NPR has learned that the Office for Civil Rights at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has opened an investigation of a similar visitation policy in Connecticut. The inquiry stems from a complaint filed by four disability groups that say that when family and support workers are banned, many elderly and disabled people can't make informed medical decisions, which can affect their care.  OCR investigates complaints about discriminatory health care policies. Last month, it announced settlements in Alabama and Pennsylvania after investigating allegations that elderly and disabled people were denied equal access to treatments for COVID-19. Those rulings then became guidance to states around the country. An OCR action on hospital visitor policies could set national practice, too.

             A family portrait of Mary Henderson. Once she lost her short-term memory and her ability to speak clearly, she relied upon family and the staff at her group home to communicate with doctors. But when she went to a hospital last month, they weren't allowed in. OCR would not confirm NPR's reporting that it had opened an investigation in Connecticut. But in a statement to NPR, Roger Severino, the director of the civil rights office, said states and hospitals need to set policies that balance safety while recognizing the needs of disabled and elderly patients. "Our recent enforcement actions," he added, "show our commitment to protecting older persons and persons with disabilities from a dog-eat-dog worldview that would deprioritize people from receiving healthcare based on unlawful stereotypes about their relative worth." There has been other pressure on HHS to act. Pennsylvania Sen. Robert Casey has called upon the head of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, which oversees health care facilities that get federal funding, to tell hospitals to ease their limits on visitors to some elderly and disabled patients.  "This decision removes an essential member of the care team," Casey wrote in an April 30 letter to Seema Verma, the CMS administrator. Family and caregivers, he wrote, know the "extensive medical history of the individual" in the hospital and can help provide "better communication with the patient and more positive health outcomes." The Senate Special Committee on Aging, of which Casey is the senior Democrat, will hold a hearing on Thursday about care for older people during the pandemic. The issue of hospital visitation is expected to be addressed. In Massachusetts, Dick Henderson describes his sister Mary as lively and social, someone known in her small town for greeting family and friends with a thumbs up or a peace sign. "She was a huge part of the family," he says. "The rock star of the family. She was the youngest of six, but she was the boss." Before Mary lost her short-term memory and her ability to communicate clearly, she wasn't afraid to let people know how she felt. At Mass one Sunday, in her customary seat in the front pew, she felt the priest's sermon was going on a bit long. She tried to get his attention by repeatedly jamming her hands together in the signal for "timeout." "OK, Mary Henderson just gave me my cue," the priest said. "I've got to cut this short." Henderson's family feels she got good medical treatment in the hospital. Doctors and nurses communicated almost daily with family members. And twice a nurse held a phone up to Mary Henderson in her hospital bed so she could hear her sister Kathy's voice. But her siblings feel if they'd been allowed into the hospital they could have helped the medical staff understand what Mary was trying to communicate. And they could have helped Mary understand the need for those IVs and tubes or uncomfortable treatments such as suctioning out her airway. "We felt badly that we couldn't be there to support her, help her communicate her feelings and her symptoms, too," says Dick Henderson. "Because we could probably figure out what she was feeling a little bit better when they were asking questions." A spokesman for the hospital sent NPR a statement: "In conjunction with the Massachusetts Department of Public Health and for the protection and safety of our patients and caregivers, all Steward Health Care hospitals in Massachusetts began restricting visitors on March 17 except in limited cases. We do allow exceptions for end-of-life visits." Lawyers for the Disability Law Center in Massachusetts wrote to the state's Department of Public Health to ask it to set statewide standards — instead of leaving it to hospitals — and to ask that family and support workers be allowed to visit people in hospitals who need assistance. Hospitals have a legal obligation to clearly advise patients and to get their informed consent for treatments, attorneys Hillary Dunn Stanisz and Rick Glassman say.  And people with disabilities have a legal right, in federal civil rights law, to have someone in the hospital who can help them communicate. That assistance makes the job of medical staff easier, says Glassman. "If you don't know them," he argues, "if you're in a chaotic hospital environment during a global pandemic and you need to interpret what their behavior is." The limitations on visitors at that hospital are common across the country. A few states, including some in hot zones such as New York and New Jersey, and a few hospitals, starting with Rush University Medical Center in Chicago, have changed policies to include family and direct service providers. Nancy Foster, vice president of quality and patient safety policy at the American Hospital Association, told NPR in a statement that "it is up to individual hospitals to set up their own protocols." In the pandemic, she says hospitals have followed guidance from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and from state and local governments "to implement even more stringent visitation restrictions because of the higher level of spread in their communities. When possible, hospitals have worked to accommodate companions in the room for those who could not speak for themselves, and when that was not permissible, other accommodations have been used, such as video or phone conferencing with family members or others." The same issues are at the heart of the complaint filed in Connecticut on behalf of three individuals who had difficulty communicating and had been hospitalized. 
                Christine Getman can move just two fingers and relies upon personal care attendants 24 hours a day. When she went to the hospital last month for a bout of meningitis, her attendant wasn't allowed in.

             Christine Getman can move just two fingers and relies upon personal care attendants 24 hours a day. When she went to the hospital last month for a bout of meningitis, her attendant wasn't allowed in. She says it would have helped both her and the hospital staff if they'd been allowed. One was a 73-year-old woman who went to a hospital with kidney problems and right away was diagnosed with COVID-19. Years before, she'd had a brain aneurysm and strokes. She lost her short-term memory. Now she gets confused and can't speak. In the 11 years since her brain injury, her family had painstakingly learned how to communicate with her, reading her gestures and emotions and speaking back words to her. But alone in the hospital, the woman's condition started spiraling down. "It's horrible. It's a living nightmare," her daughter told NPR. "And to know that your mom knows what's going on but can't communicate it and probably feels that we left her there is beyond devastating." The last time the mother went to the hospital, last summer, her husband or one of her three daughters stayed with her around the clock. "People don't typically try to communicate with her because she's nonverbal," the daughter says. " So they don't look at her and explain to her what's going on. Where we've always been able to say, 'Mommy, there's this test that's going to be very uncomfortable' and we've learned techniques to help her relax during certain tests because they are very painful and she's never had to be sedated or tied down." Now she is tied down and sedated while on a ventilator in the ICU. NPR agreed not to name the family because they've joined in the complaint without using their name. There have been some nurses who have held up an iPad so the family can talk to their mother. But it's just not the same as being there, the daughter says, adding that there have been missed X-rays, missed tests and extra pain. It's not just families of patients who have filed complaints. In Oregon, Christine Getman gets round-the-clock assistance because she has a progressive neuromuscular disease and she can't move except for two fingers. She uses a power wheelchair. On the back, there's a ventilator with a tube that goes to her throat to help her breathe and speak. A personal care attendant  helps her eat, get dressed, talk on the phone or just move her body so that she can avoid getting painful bedsores — 24 hours a day. With that help, Getman gets around. And she runs a small nonprofit group. When she went to the hospital last month for a bout of meningitis and ended up on a COVID-19 ward, her attendant wasn't allowed in. Getman says it would have been better for her, and the hospital staff, if her attendant had been allowed to help. "Anytime somebody entered my room to help me use the bathroom, eat or reposition, it was another round of changing gloves and masks, using sanitizers and gowns," she says. "And my care attendants would have stayed in my room. They wouldn't use up any additional PPE." A coalition of disability groups this month filed another complaint over hospital practices in Oregon. It included a demand that people like Getman be allowed to bring an attendant with them to the hospital.

             Vicki Novikoff Barnhart of Galveston, Texas, shows off her new microwave and a fresh red pepper. Maybe your garbage disposal is broken or the fridge is slowly dying. Because of the coronavirus lockdown, you can't easily call a professional. But you have a hammer and you have YouTube, so what could go wrong? We asked listeners that question, and they said plenty! Vicki Novikoff Barnhart of Galveston, Texas, had a problem that was driving her to the point of madness. Her microwave oven was beeping loudly nonstop, 24 hours a day. Because it was built in, it wasn't possible to just unplug it. A friend suggested she turn off the circuit breaker to the microwave. But it was mounted outside up high and would require taking the back off, which she figured was too dangerous. A different friend said to hit the microwave with a hammer. That just seemed like a great way to get electrocuted. So the beeping went on. Day after day after day. "I wanted to get a gun and shoot it," she says, "but I didn't have a gun." After living like this for six weeks, Barnhart finally got a repairman to come to the house to install a new microwave. He put the old one out on the curb, promising that someone would happily take it away. He was right. A few days later, Barnhart was outside and heard a familiar sound. "I knew it was my microwave and it was at a neighbor's house," she says. "And then a full day later, I was out there and it was still on and it was still beeping!" Barnhart recently was on her neighborhood posting site and saw these words: "Does anybody hear that beeping and do you know what it is?" A perfect quarantine match It was a quiet Sunday night in lockdown when Sophia Hsu of Brooklyn, N.Y., heard a crash and expletives coming from the bathroom. Hsu ran downstairs to find her husband standing next to the sink, now dangling off the wall. Her husband, who's over 6 feet tall and says he has trouble turning around in small spaces, had "hip-checked" (ran into) the sink. Hsu says he "wrecked the sink, the underlying pipes and my good weekend mood." Hsu, the handy one in the family, opened up her toolbox. She lacked the right wrench, but using common sense and lessons from her father, she reattached the sink and all the pipes, and now it drains perfectly. Theirs is a perfect quarantine match. "He breaks things," Hsu says. "I fix them." Water everywhere For Megan Glasscock of Pensacola, Fla., the recent national toilet paper shortage inspired her to install a bidet with her mother.

             The bathroom at the Glasscock house in Pensacola, Fla., where mother and daughter attempted to install a bidet. "I read the instructions," Glasscock says. "I said, 'Aah, 20 minutes — this will be a breeze.' " "Mind you, Megan knows nothing about plumbing," says her mother, Cheryl Glasscock. The pair knew enough, though, to turn the water to the toilet off before getting started. After hours of struggling to install the bidet, which included a trip to the hardware store for a part, they called it quits for the night. They turned the water back on. "That's when the nightmare began," Megan says. The bathroom started flooding, and now this time the water wouldn't turn off. Cheryl rushed outside to cut off the main water supply to the house. But in the dark, she couldn't find the valve. She reached down and started turning a wheel. That's when water began bubbling up from the ground. Now both the bathroom and the yard were flooding. Water was everywhere. Buckets were no match. Eventually the local water company arrived. They were dumbstruck at the destruction they found. They pumped out the yard and replaced the water meter that Cheryl had destroyed when she somehow disconnected the water meter from the water line. After the mess was cleaned up and tears were dried, mother and daughter installed the bidet, this time following instructions on YouTube. That's key, the Glasscocks say. They are now the proud owners of a bidet, just as toilet paper is back on the shelves! Good walls make good neighbors

Kenneth McNay of Morrisville, N.C., also decided to use the shutdown to take on a DIY project. "I noticed that the retaining wall between my and my neighbor's townhomes was sagging in the center." He removed all the stones, leveled the ground with paving stones, rock and sand and then put everything back straight. He felt rather proud of the finished job. McNay's neighbor, however, was not happy. She wanted a professional to do it. The neighbor was also worried about the safety warnings on the bags of stone and sand, which McNay found really puzzling. "During the next weekend, she completely reversed my work, taking away all the stones, taking all the sand and gravel out and then putting it all back with a sag in the middle," McNay says. What did McNay's neighbor do with the paving, gravel and sand that he had so carefully installed during the pandemic, when we are all supposed to be practicing social distancing and keeping surfaces clean? She returned them all to his porch in zip-lock bags. NPR's Peter Breslow produced this story for broadcast.

             Patients entering the Pikine Hospital in Dakar on April 23. Every morning at a few minutes after 10 a.m. Dakar time, an official from Senegal's Health Ministry walks calmly to a podium, usually with a face mask pulled across his or her face – so there's no visual clue as to whether the days COVID-19 case count is good news or cause for worry. The official reaches the microphone and begins a routine that has become a daily staple in Senegal since the outbreak began here in early March. First, the official lists the results of yesterday's COVID-19 tests. (In Senegal, test results are routinely known within 24 hours). In a monotone voice, the official reads off multiple figures — number of new cases, the number of those new cases who were known contacts (so already in isolation), the number who were infected by community transmission, the number of recovered patients, and more.  More than two months into the outbreak the country of almost 16 million people has registered more than 2,400 positive cases and 25 deaths. As people watch, they chime in on Facebook with emoji-laden comments: "Almost 1,000 sick, that is scary ...."49 recovered "... "It's time for us to learn how to live with COVID-19 as we do with malaria, HIV, hypertensions. if not it will be a catastrophe. We cannot rest at our homes anymore. Two months is too long." And every time a death is announced, the official adds a personal note: "Senegal registered its 13th death from COVID-19 Tuesday, May 5, 2020. The death was a 94-year-old man. The Minister of Health and Social Action offers its condolences to his family." In this country of 16 million known for its peaceful democracy and sense of community, Senegal's response to the coronavirus is notable not only for its humanity but for its thoroughness. For example, each newly diagnosed individual – no matter how mild or severe the case – is provided a hospital or health center bed where he or she stays isolated and observed– a key element to Senegal's strategy to contain the virus. "Senegal is doing quite well, and we were impressed at the beginning at the full engagement and commitment by the head of state," says Michel Yao, program manager for emergency response for the World Health Organization Africa.   Officials from both Senegal's ministry of health and WHO stress that the wheels of the response team were set in motion five years ago in response to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. Yao explains: "What we advised countries to have in place following Ebola in West Africa was to have an operations center, to have in one place the required information for effective decision making. It's quite an important tool to control the crisis, and this was a good plan from Senegal to have this structure."  Senegal set up its Health Emergency Operation Center (also known by its French acronym, COUS), in December 2014, in response to the Ebola outbreak spreading in nearby countries. At the start of this year, the center had some 23 staff members – five of them doctors.  Over the past five years, that center, working with the ministry of health and the support of international partners such as the World Health Organization, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and UNICEF, have run simulations of mock outbreaks and crafted emergency measures to activate in case of an epidemic.

             A motorbike rider in Dakar wears a mask with the silhouette of a local religious leader. That half a decade of preparation was set into motion on March 2. In an uncanny coincidence, Senegal's president Macky Sall was meeting with health officials to finalize the country's COVID-19 contingency plan hours before the first case was confirmed at the Pasteur Institute lab down the street from the Presidential Palace where they were meeting — a traveler returning to Dakar, the capital city, from France.  "We must not wait for it to fall on us, to react," President Sall said of the virus as he outlined the agenda before the meeting. In fact, says Dr. Abdoualye Bousso, director of COUS, Senegalese health officials had started forming their contingency plan in January after receiving an alert on January 10 from an international network of health agencies they follow closely.  Bousso added they knew that to hospitalize every positive case and isolate all contacts would be a challenge in a country where hospital equipment is in short supply. At the start of the outbreak, there were only 86 ICU beds able to provide oxygen support in public health facilities, he says.  "The first issue was to find beds for eventual cases," Bousso says. For the first step his team and partners added 500 beds, mostly in existing health-care facilities. By early May they had upped that to 900 new beds in health centers and hospitals, with another 300 beds for milder cases in hotels. The plan is to scale up by another 700 beds dedicated to COVID-19 patients by the end of May. This strategy of a bed for every case – no matter how mild the symptoms — –has helped stop the spread of the virus in a country where most people live in large family households where it's nearly impossible to self-isolate, says Nicolas Mouly, head of emergency services for ALIMA, an international health organization working with the Senegalese government to ramp up health-care facilities. "They could contaminate other people if they were home," he says of the milder cases. Senegal has also set up contact tracing teams working out of 78 district health centers, supported by the Red Cross and the World Health Organization but headed by local staff to build trust, Bousso stresses. By May, the budget for Senegal's response was $160 million.  Once the contacts are identified, adds Bousso, they are quarantined in a hotel room for two weeks, with meals provided. These vast preparations and quick actions were also needed because Senegal's health infrastructure is not adequate and could be easily overwhelmed. According to WHO, there are an estimated 7 physicians per 100,000 people.  Like many countries around the globe, Senegal has taken other measures to control the spread of COVID-19. With 47 total positive cases recorded by March 20, Senegal had already closed its borders to air traffic, put schools on hiatus, enforced a curfew and shuttered many gathering spots, such as restaurants and mosques.  To help the working poor during confinement, in March, President Sall announced an Economic and Social Resilience Program that will among other actions pay the electricity bills of some 975,522 households for six months and purchase food for one million eligible households.  Despite praise for the president's initial actions, there have been some missteps and controversies. After initially closing down mosques in mid-March (prompting at least one protest by hundreds of worshipers in a Dakar neighborhood), the president eased restrictions on May 11 — the day Senegal registered 177 new positive cases — its highest number. Sall said houses of worship (as well as businesses) could reopen the next day.  Hady Ba, a professor of cognitive science and philosophy at the University of Dakar and an expert on Senegalese politics, says the sudden opening of the mosques most likely reflected pressure from Senegal's powerful Muslim leaders on the government during the month of Ramadan. "We have these religious leaders asking to be authorized to pray," he says, noting that religious leaders have always had a powerful sway in politics.

             There have been other concerns as well. Early on, the police in some areas assaulted people with batons for being out in the streets past curfew. Shortly afterward, the police issued a statement apologizing for "excessive force." And part of the country's current treatment plan includes the controversial strategy of treatment with the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine, backed by Dr. Moussa Seydi, head of infectious and tropical medicine at Dakar's Fann Hospital – despite warnings from the World Health Organization about the potential risks and dangers of using such untested medicines. So far, officials in Senegal say they have kept the numbers low enough to stick the strategy of a bed for every case and isolation for contacts as well. And officials at the Pasteur Institute are working on a test that would give results in 10 minutes. The WHO representative in Senegal, Dr. Lucile Imboua, says she is hopeful this test will be successful.  For the moment, Bousso is hopeful that Senegal will keep its case counts low, despite steadily rising case numbers in both the political capital of Dakar and the country's largest holy city, Touba. He's also realistic about how hard that might be. "We can stop the fire in our country but the fire is still going in other countries.." he says, trailing off before he has to run to another urgent meeting.

                Yellowstone National Park begins a phased reopening Monday, with the park's Wyoming entrances slated to open for day use only.

             Yellowstone National Park begins a phased reopening Monday, with the park's Wyoming entrances slated to open for day use only. Billed as the oldest operating hotel in West Yellowstone, Mont., the Madison is a short hop from the west entrance to Yellowstone National Park. With its original pine log siding and thick wood beams, the historic hotel sits on a street squeezed with camera stores and trinket shops hawking Old Faithful t-shirts, wooden grizzly bears carved by chain saws and paintings of the iconic Yellowstone Falls.  Normally these sidewalks beneath the old western facade would be humming with tourists. But obviously nothing about anything we're living through is normal. "It's really disheartening, there is no one here," says Garrett Ostler, owner of the Madison. "You could shoot a bullet in any direction and not have to worry." There's been growing pressure from business owners in gateway towns like this to reopen America's most popular national parks, even as many states still have travel restrictions and continue to see rising cases of coronavirus. Yellowstone, the country's first national park and one of its most popular, will begin a phased reopening Monday when the gates come down at its Wyoming entrances only. The park closed March 24, largely at the request of local officials in towns and states surrounding the park. "Sunrise" reopening Yellowstone is an especially complicated case. The park touches three states, all with a mix travel restrictions and rates of coronavirus infections alongside a patchwork of local health districts with different enforcement rules. Most of the towns are small and lack health care infrastructure and could be overwhelmed by an influx of cases. Yellowstone and neighboring Grand Teton National Park draw visitors from around the country and world.  "There's a point in time where the stressers of economics start to override the fear of the virus with some people," says Cameron Sholly, the Yellowstone superintendent.  Sholly is ushering through what's being billed as a "sunrise" reopening. Initially it will be barebones; day use only in Wyoming with few if any services available. At a to be determined future date, some campgrounds and other businesses in the park will be allowed to reopen, as well as its three Montana entrances. Of the four million annual visitors to Yellowstone, almost three-fourths of them tend to pass through the Montana gateway towns. Garrett Ostler at the Madison is frustrated that an official date hasn't been set on his side of the park. 
                Garrett Ostler, owner of the historic Madison Hotel in West Yellowstone, Mont., has hired about half his normal summer staff. Reservations are cratering.

             Garrett Ostler, owner of the historic Madison Hotel in West Yellowstone, Mont., has hired about half his normal summer staff. Reservations are cratering. "There are people who have been hunkered down for eight weeks and are ready for some healing and normalcy," he says. "Yellowstone brings that." His bookings for June are at barely 15% of normal, and reservations later in the summer are cratering amid all the uncertainty.  Ostler says he's put the steps in place to protect his guests from the virus. But even he isn't sure how you regulate social distancing in one of the nation's most crowded national parks. "People really struggle with staying 50 feet away from a bison, let alone six feet from each other," Ostler says. "We're social critters." Crowd management  Yellowstone's highways and its boardwalk paths atop boiling geothermal pools can be infamously clogged with tourists. On road shoulders, it's not uncommon to see crowds of amateur photographers with tripods trained on bison or bears or moose. And then there's Old Faithful, which on a warm summer day can be more crowded amusement park than pristine geyser.    "I don't pretend to say that I can disperse every crowd and every picture you're going to see out of Yellowstone and Old Faithful is going to be people standing six feet apart," Supt. Sholly said. Park officials say they've figured out how to manage and regulate crowds in indoor spaces. But the outdoors are going to take serious cooperation with the public. This is a big reason why parks like this aren't just turning on all the lights and inviting everyone back in at once. Yellowstone's initial plans are designed to evolve and change with the science. Other large parks that have begun phased reopening such as the Grand Canyon in Arizona and the Great Smoky Mountains in Tennessee have adopted similar strategies.  The Trump administration and its Department of Interior appears to be leaving it up to individual park superintendents to make decisions about how and when to reopen. "No one is putting economics over health," Sholly says. "But is there a balance we can strike where we can start to reopen safely, get some of the economy rolling again, but not so far so fast that we can't pull back if it doesn't work out."  Ready or not, here they come  For every business owner pressuring him to reopen quickly, Sholly says he's gotten just as much pressure from others urging him to stay closed longer. The resort areas west of the park in Gallatin County, Mont., had been a coronavirus hot spot. In Montana and Idaho, technically all nonessential out of state travelers are supposed to self-quarantine for 14 days on arrival.  It's not really being enforced, which makes some locals like Melissa Alder nervous. She co-owns Freeheel and Wheel, an outdoor store and coffee bar in West Yellowstone.

             Melissa Alder, co-owner of Freeheel and Wheel in West Yellowstone, is worried that the park reopening could bring a spike in coronavirus cases. "We are fearful of the congregation of people that will come," Alder says. "I don't think we're ready."  Alder got money from the federal CARES Act to help her ride through for a few more weeks, mostly so she can keep paying her employees. They began a soft reopening themselves recently, mostly delivering coffees to customers out on the sidewalk and doing bike repairs by appointment. Alder says she'd rather the park stay closed than reopen too soon, only to have to shut down in the actual summer high season if there was a second wave of cases. "We don't have a hospital, we don't even have a doctor full time here in West Yellowstone," Alder says. The nearest hospital is more than an hour's drive away in Big Sky, Mont., or Rexberg, Idaho.  Despite the park closure, Alder has been spotting out of state plates arriving in town and hearing second homeowners talking in the grocery store about traveling to Montana to ride out the pandemic. Just the other day, West Yellowstone reported its first coronavirus cases, believed to have been traced to a family visiting from out of state.

             The usually humming streets of West Yellowstone at the park's main western entrance are deserted. One evening on the otherwise deserted Yellowstone Avenue, tourist Donny Santee said he drove west from his home in Iowa thinking the park would have reopened by now.  "I think America needs to get out," he said. "If you think that the bug is something to worry about, keep locking these people up then you'll have a problem you ain't never seen." Clutching plastic shopping bags full of gifts he said he bought to support local businesses, Santee praised Trump for pushing to reopen national parks. He said people know to protect themselves from the virus. "If you get rid of individualism, then you get rid of America," Santee says. "That's what this is really about."  That ethos says it all about the challenges facing many institutions here in America, under pressure to reopen even if it's not yet known whether doing that is safe. Resilience. It's the word of the hour. Weeks into the coronavirus pandemic, many people are wondering: How do you find the strength to keep going when everything seems bleak? How do you stop thinking, "What did I do to deserve this?" Manyang Reath Kher, a Sudanese refugee now living in the U.S., shares his moment of deepest despair — and how he pulled through.

             Jerry Morales owns Gerardo's Casita, in Midland, Texas. The former mayor of Midland and past president of the Texas Restaurant Association has done anything and everything to keep his businesses alive over the past two months. Restaurant doors are cautiously opening again in Texas, but nothing is quite the same with the continuing threat of the  pandemic. Eateries have had to get creative to survive, and learn how to protect their customers and staff.  Jerry Morales is the amiable, animated owner of Gerardo's Casita, in Midland, Texas. With menus in hand, he greets customers who are just venturing out after seven long weeks of quarantine. "Y'all been doing alright, staying safe?" he asks.         Wendy Holland, a Mary Kay beauty consultant, looks up grinning from a plate of beef tacos with pico de gallo.  "We do a lot of cooking, but I'm a little tired of what I cook," she says with a laugh. "Ready for a little change today."   The dining room is classic Tex-Mex décor — sombreros, beer signs and a Mexican flag. But most of the tables have been removed or roped-off to create a 6-foot buffer between diners. That's what the governor ordered earlier this month when he allowed restaurants to open at 25% of capacity. Morales closed Gerardo's and his two other restaurants in one world, and reopened in another. Across the country, more than 8 million restaurant employees have been laid off or furloughed, and the industry has lost at least $80 billion in sales, according to the National Restaurant Association. Now that Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has allowed restaurants and other businesses to reopen, the state is "embarking on a grand experiment in public health," one doctor here warned. For a restaurateur, it means unimagined challenges.   "We had to start being nurses in our restaurants," Morales said. "You've got to look for signs now of temperature, coughing, sneezing, people holding their chest. If you're back in the kitchen and a delivery person comes in with a major cold, you have my permission to kick 'em out immediately!"  All that, and they still have to make sure the fajitas come out sizzling. As a former mayor of Midland and past president of the Texas Restaurant Association, Morales is a take-charge guy. He's done anything and everything to keep his businesses alive in the last two months of restaurant hell. First, there was the impromptu store.  "We already have essential goods that our food suppliers would deliver us every day," he says. "So we were selling beans and rice, sugar was a big hot commodity, eggs, milk, bacon, hamburger meat, chicken, cheese, flour, all those things that our customers needed."   When stores ran out of bleach, Gerardo's created its own household sanitizer.  "We put a formula together that had soap, bleach and a few other items, put a label on it and called it the Corona Killa," he explains. "So we sold about 400 bottles of that within days."

             When stores ran out of bleach, Gerardo's created its own household sanitizer. After the state passed an emergency measure to let restaurants sell alcohol-to-go, the Corona Killa was followed soon after by the Corona-rita.   "We started selling packages of Corona-rita as our margaritas. We were strategizing, we were thinking off our feet all the time," Morales says.  The public reaction to Texas lifting stay-at-home orders has been mixed. Some folks are still hunkering down at home. Others are stretching their legs and tiptoeing back into public life.  "This is the first time out in, literally, in seven weeks," said Richard Scherer, a petroleum engineer, who was having the catfish special. "It's for mental health purposes that I got to get out. Seriously."   His lunch partner, Jay Reynolds, a local oil and gas investor, was not troubled that going out to eat — he had grilled chicken breast in salsa verde — was premature. "I believe if we do what they ask us to do, I feel safe," Reynolds said. "I feel like I want to get out, just like Richard. I've been at my home, my office. That's all I've done. So I think the virus is serious but I think you've got to go on with your life."  Gerardo's Casita is struggling, like every other restaurant in town. Jerry Morales is looking anxiously toward Monday when Gov. Abbott will decide whether to let restaurants increase their occupancy from 25% to 50%. The proprietor shudders to think what happens if a new wave of the coronavirus hits next fall.  "I don't know that restaurants can survive another round," he said. "It's so hard and very scary." 
                A growing number of sleep-away camps have already been canceled because of the coronavirus.

             A growing number of sleep-away camps have already been canceled because of the coronavirus. Updated on May 19 at 11 a.m. Summer camps around the nation are grappling with whether or how they can open this summer as the pandemic continues. The prospect is especially challenging for overnight camps, where hundreds of kids play, eat and sleep together, and the very idea of social distancing is completely anathema to the camp experience.  Little wonder a growing number of sleep-away camps have already capitulated to COVID-19.  "The cancellation of camp this summer is profoundly disappointing for all of us after what already feels like an eternity of frustration and uncertainty," wrote Shannon Donovan-Monti, executive director at Chimney Corners Camp in Western Massachusetts, in an email to parents this week.  "There are no words that can take away the heartbreak of depriving our children and ourselves of something that has given us such joy and connection to others." Eleven-year old Maddie Prince was among the many Chimney Corners campers who took it hard. "It makes me sad that I can't be with my friends," she said.  Camp is where she "grows up more," she said, and where she is happiest. "You don't have any tech and it's really easy to forget all of your worries," she added. "I would argue that kids need camp this summer more than ever before," said Dayna Hardin, president of CampGroup, which runs 15 camps from Maine to Michigan, including 13 overnight camps that are still hoping to open.  She says the overnight experience might be just what the doctor ordered for kids who have been suffering through months of isolation and anxiety. And she argued that kids may actually be safer from infection at overnight camp than at home. "We are looking at this like we are the castle," Hardin said. "Our kids are going to enter the castle and we are going to pull up the drawbridge and we will be our own isolated community."   But a strict "no in, no out" policy would certainly crimp camps' style. It would mean no field trips, no visiting days and no socials or sports tournaments with other camps.  Staff would have to remain on campus for days off. And laundry and food deliveries would pose challenges.  Camp life inside the "bubble," as some are calling it, would also change. Instead of playing tag, kids would have to fill their time with noncontact activities like making crafts.  "Camp is going to look very different," said Matt Fragala, managing principal consultant at Environmental Health & Engineering, the group hired by the American Camp Association (ACA) to recommend best practices and guidelines for camps. Specifics will depend on state and local mandates, but Fragala said recommendations will include constant disinfecting, spreading kids out for sleeping and eating at a distance and in shifts in the dining hall. The goal, Fragala said, is to "control some of the mayhem the best way we can. It's going to be a change from business as usual at camp. But there's a balance we have to try to meet to keep everybody safe and to minimize potential risk."  Camps are also expecting to have to split kids up into smaller units, said ACA president and CEO Tom Rosenberg. "These would be like families where [kids] would be able to socialize somewhat normally," he said. "But between the family circles, there will be physical distancing."  The same rule would apply to wearing face masks, according to Rosenberg.  Campers would wear them when outside their "family" group, he said, and staff who interact with more than one "family" group, like a food service worker or an archery instructor, would likely have to wear a mask all day. Camps would be expected to regularly monitor campers and staff for symptoms of COVID-19, for example by taking temperatures every day. But whether camps would test for COVID-19 is an open question. Some camps see testing as a requirement; they won't even consider opening unless they could test kids before and during the session. But other camps say they would not test, relying on taking campers' temperatures daily and watching for other symptoms. That's an approach some parents find irresponsible.  "That keeps me up at night," said Fina Barouch, a Boston-area physician and parent of two campers. She said she will not allow her kids to go to camp.  "It only takes one person to be shedding virus when completely asymptomatic, and my concern is that this could turn into something like the nursing home pandemic, where it just spreads exponentially," Barouch said.  The CDC has issued its guidance for camps, recommending general precautions like social distancing, screening and extra disinfecting. The agency also directs camps to follow state and local laws, but in most cases camps are still waiting to hear what those will be, and they're growing increasingly frustrated that they don't have more information to help them make their decision.  State and local governments are beginning to make their decisions on sleep-away camps. Georgia has banned them for the summer, and Connecticut has banned them "for the duration of this [...] public health emergency," which is likely to last through the summer. On the other hand, an executive order in Texas allows overnight camps to open after May 31 as long as they follow safety protocols, and officials in Vermont appear headed in the same direction. Other states, such as Minnesota, have banned overnight camps for now while keeping open possibilities for later. The vast majority of jurisdictions are still wrestling with the issue.  Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker said the issue comes up every day in conversation with other states.    "The tough part," he said, "is figuring out, especially when it comes to some of the stuff that involves the joys of being a kid, figuring out some way to do this, where you have at least enough rules to make sure it can be done safely, but you don't destroy the whole spontaneous nature of what those are supposed to be about."  Indeed, one camp director said an overnight camp that cuts so many core traditions would be like Disney World without the Magic Kingdom or Mickey Mouse.   Camp consultant Lauren Kasnett Nearpass, co-founder of Summer 365, agrees  that if the restrictions become so onerous that camp no longer feels like camp, it may no longer be worth it.   "If you have to remove the magic completely," she said, "if it's going to look and feel so different, then perhaps you know, we just power forward to 2021." The prospect of a watered-down camp experience gives pause even to die-hard campers like 15-year-old twins Sasha and Amanda Fine, who were looking forward to the perks and privileges they would enjoy as members of the oldest bunk at their camp this summer.  "Trust me, I want camp more than anyone," said Sasha. "It's just that we can't have camp like this. Like it's taunting us." A month ago, Amanda said, her friends were all in favor of going to camp this summer no matter what. But now, she said, rather than a heavily compromised and shortened 2020, most would rather wait and have a "normal" summer in 2021. Staying home and sheltering in place can be stressful for everyone. But for some college students who identify as LGBTQ, returning to family environments can be very difficult and even psychologically damaging, psychologists say.  "A lot of young people when they make it to college are able, for the first time, really, to live their truth," says psychologist Megan Mooney  who works with children, teens and young people and specializes in preventing and treating trauma in LGBTQ youth. Mooney is also President of the Texas Psychological Association. Now, many young people are forced to stay in a home setting that forces them to hide their identity again. And even when stay-at-home orders start to lift, most dorms are closed, and colleges may stay closed for summer and and even fall terms  For many of these young people, Mooney says, college is a refuge from years of rejection and discrimination in high school and even from family members.  "The vast majority of LGBTQ youth in high school experienced name calling on a regular basis, the kinds of names I don't even like to repeat because they are so offensive," Mooney says. In addition, school policies often prohibited the type of clothing they wanted to wear, the restrooms they could use, athletic events they could take part in, as well as participation in special celebrations like prom with their partners. College is "a life affirming new world," says Mooney, "where these young people can date who they want, dress as they choose, access medical care and treatments they weren't able to before, access mental health care they weren't able to before; being out of the home and away at college is a life line for a lot of LGBTQ people." Help is available  If you or someone you know is feeling hopeless, contact The Trevor Project's TrevorLifeline 24/7 at 1.866.488.7386, via chat every day or by texting "START" to 678-678. Returning to the family home can be traumatizing all over again, she says, especially if parents or siblings reject them or are even hostile. She says LGBTQ young people have a high likelihood of having experienced a lot of trauma and stressful life events already; that means the impact of returning to an unsupportive home is dramatically magnified.  "So what we are most concerned about is seeing increases in anxiety and depression including suicidality," Mooney says. Suicide and crisis hotline calls are now on a rapid rise at The Trevor Project, a large suicide prevention and crisis intervention organization for LGBTQ young people. CEO Amit Paley says that since the onset of COVID-19 the volume of youth reaching out to The Trevor Project's crisis services program has increased dramatically at times spiking to more than double the volumes from earlier in 2020. "There are just so many young people who are impacted and scared and frightened and in unsafe or challenging situations and many of them are reaching out for help and to talk about what they are going through," he says.  'You can't be gay' A college senior, Mia says that at school she could finally "be herself" complete with a gay pride flag in her apartment.  Her friends are accepting and "feel like family" she says, "they love me for who I am." (NPR is not using her last name because she fears being ostracized by her family if they found out about her sexuality.)  But her parents are evangelical and the message they gave her, she says, is "you can't be gay; you have to leave that at the cross if you want to be a Christian."  Mia says her Dad is very angry and frustrated with her, and she thinks he suspects that she is gay. She says she fears that if they knew she was lesbian she would be disowned.       She decided to shelter at a friend's parents house because it was not an emotionally toxic place for her. Her friend's parents "are not abusive and they allow you to have different opinions from theirs. They do not care that I'm gay. I am accepted no matter what." Even so, she is saddened that she can't be home with her own family.  She misses them, especially her mother. She says they have "always been a big part of my life."  The impact on the young person ranges from feelings of guilt, shame or fear to worries about their physical safety. Paley says parents might not realize that these types of rejecting behaviors can put the young person in danger. "In fact, the emotional damage that rejecting parents can have is enormous," he says.    Paley points out that LGBTQ youth who have rejecting families are eight times more likely to attempt suicide than those who do not have rejecting families, according to a study published in 2009 in the journal Pediatrics. Conversely, a recent Trevor Project survey found that just having one supportive adult in a young person's life reduces their risk of suicide by 40%.  "And that's why we really want to make sure that every adult and every family member is really thinking about how they can come from a place of love and support and acceptance because it can literally save lives," he says.  Facing rejection and hostility Leaving accepting college environments, Paley says, can be especially painful for those who are transgender. "You're forced back into this home environment where not only you don't have those normal sources of support but you may have parents who are calling you by a name that is different than the name that you are using in most of your life, who may be referring to you with gender and pronoun markers that are not who you really are" and that can be incredibly difficult, Paley says.  Of course, there are families that are accepting and supportive, he says, and some that are "trying their best." But there are heartbreaking stories, he says, of extreme rejection and hostility. "We hear stories about parents who say things to their children that you couldn't possibly imagine someone could say," he says. For example, Paley recently took a call from a young person who told him they had just come out to their father and the father said, as Paley recalls, "you are an abomination before God, you are a disgrace to this family and I will not accept you for being who you are." When you hear something like this, says Paley and "you can't help wondering how a parent could reject their own child's authenticity." He says they routinely hear about parents who say they no longer want the child "under this roof" and, especially in the case of transgender children, refuse to call them by their chosen name and even force them to dress in a way that clearly doesn't correspond with their gender identity.  Staying connected The risk of mental health problems for LGBTQ youth is further exacerbated because they can no longer interact on a daily basis with all those people in the college community who were supportive. "And now they don't have any of those sources of support, at least physically and they're with people who don't accept them, which leaves a lot of young people feeling completely alone," Paley says. The disparity between how good and supported these young people felt before and how lonely and rejected they might feel at the moment makes the situation even more painful.  Physical distancing does not mean social isolation, he says. Young people may be in a small living space that is not supportive but Paley encourages them to reach out to people who are supportive, whether that's other family members, friends, teachers or organizations like the Trevor Project. Maintaining social connection is critically important during this crisis, says psychologist Mary Alvord who specializes in teaching resilience and has co authored two books on the topic. There's a big difference between being alone and being lonely, she explains. "You can be alone and be OK with it, maybe even feeling a sense of calm," she says. "The problem is when you feel lonely you feel like you don't have the support out there, you don't have the connections and it's a feeling of being sort of an island unto yourself without somebody there to have your back."     Social connection is one of the key protective factors in resilience, she says. "First we need to remember that we're not alone and if we can get support from others and talk with others again, we get perspective and we get the validation of who we are and what we want and what we think is important." Luckily in today's world, online venues for connection are plentiful, she says. Young people "need to connect with a community or at least with friends who accept them for who they are and share their value system," says Alvord.  And it's important to remember, she says that the hopelessness many young people may feel now is not going to last forever. Social distancing will let up, schools will open again sooner or later, and eventually the pandemic will end.  "When we have moments to ourselves we can actually remember the times when we were in a good place and in a good space and our identities were affirmed; and really keep that in mind that we can go back to that," she says.

             Dr. Ray Lorenzoni is in his second year of a pediatric cardiology fellowship at the Children's Hospital at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx. In March, he was recruited to treat adult COVID-19 patients during New York City's peak. On the night of March 30, just before 7 p.m., Dr. Ray Lorenzoni put on his face mask, walked across the street from the Bronx apartment he shares with his wife and started his shift at the Children's Hospital at Montefiore Medical Center. Lorenzoni, 35, is in his second year of a pediatric cardiology fellowship at the hospital. But this night, the patients would be different: It was his first shift treating adult coronavirus patients — the first adults he's treated in the hospital since medical school six years before.   "Coming into the hospital, it was a little bit unreal," he says. "The whole floor was filled with adult patients." By then, COVID-19 cases systemwide at Montefiore Medical Center had gone from just two cases a little over two weeks earlier to more than 700. In response, Montefiore transformed part of the children's hospital into a 40-bed adult COVID unit. All around the city, other hospitals were making similar adjustments. Medical students graduated early. Operating rooms were converted into ICUs. A field hospital went up in Central Park.  But the surge in New York City has done much more than simply rearrange space and upend protocol. More than 15,000 people have died of COVID-19 there, and that enormous toll will profoundly impact the city's tens of thousands of health care workers for years to come. Lorenzoni is one of them.  A little over a month ago, Lorenzoni answered a request from NPR for hospital workers to describe what work was like at the epicenter of the crisis. Lorenzoni began recording his reflections for NPR after his shifts, sitting at the desk in his bedroom, speaking into his iPhone in a slow, measured voice. Just a few weeks earlier, Lorenzoni had watched — along with many other Americans — how the Italian medical system had been brought to its knees. It seemed likely it was only a matter of when, not if, the coronavirus would arrive in the U.S. And of course, by then, it already had.  "I knew I could be involved because of what happened in Italy," Lorenzoni says, and adds, "a pediatric physician needing to take care of critical adult patients is unheard of." Still, he was surprised he was recruited so early.  "They filled us up pretty quickly and the patients were very sick. I remember in the first couple shifts we were putting breathing tubes in patients on a floor that doesn't usually do that," he says. Treating adults hit him hard, he says. He's used to working with kids. "Pediatrics is a career where most of your patients get better," he says. "But these were very with-it adults who were scared. They knew what the risk was." It felt important to him, he says, to be honest about what was happening, even when the news wasn't good. "One of my main mantras is to sit down with somebody. And that was very tough in this environment because our protective equipment didn't surround us," he says. "So we were discouraged from sitting down on the bed next to a patient to have a deep discussion or sitting down in a chair and being at eye level with the patient." Instead, he says he would do his best to give his patient a sense of comfort by leaning against the wall, trying not to stand over or talk down to them. "I think patients can see right through a physician when they try to dance around a difficult conversation," he says. "You can be honest with a person and they appreciate that honesty." One patient, a man in his mid-forties, kept asking how bad his condition was. As the man's health deteriorated, Lorenzoni was open with him, aware that those hard conversations — like what it means to be put on a ventilator — are sometimes the last a patient will ever have. "I remember that he asked me, 'doc, I know I'm not getting better, what else can we do?' and unfortunately I had to answer that we'd been doing everything we could. And he broke down. And I broke down a little bit in tears," he says.

             Dr. Ray Lorenzoni, a pediatrician in the Bronx, answered a request from NPR and captured his experiences treating adult COVID-19 patients during New York City's peak in a series of audio recordings. In his recordings, Lorenzoni lingered on the quieter moments. He spoke about why it was important to take time with his patients, especially because visitors were not allowed. One woman, in her early 30s, often wanted staff to check in on her, beyond the usual rounds that doctors and nurses make. "I feel like she knew she wasn't doing well, and she wanted the company," Lorenzoni says.  When he would leave for the day, he'd check in on her to make sure she was okay, but he worried that she would take a turn for the worse by the time he returned.  Eventually, that's what happened. She needed to be placed on a ventilator to breathe. "One of the things I remember before the breathing tube was placed was simply sitting by her side and telling her what was going to happen. And what we could and couldn't do to help," he remembers. "She was scared about how little control she had or even the doctors had in how she did." Lorenzoni transferred her to an ICU, an operating room that had been converted. His shift was ending, and he signed out his other patients, but he stayed on to be with this one during the intubation.  "When her body didn't respond well to that, because it was so weak, I was there doing chest compressions on her," he says. "And I signed her death certificate afterwards. It was a tough day." She was the first of his patients to die. "Although she passed away without her family by her side, she wasn't alone," he says. "I hope that even this small amount of company that she had at the end was comforting for her. And it's going to be one of the things that sticks with me for the rest of my career." Many of the people who have died from COVID-19 in New York had underlying health conditions, like diabetes and high blood pressure, and that's true in Lorenzoni's experience as well. But he says conditions that put someone at a higher risk are much more common than people realize. "These are people that we know. These are people that we're related to," he says. "It's either yourself, or your neighbor, or people that you work with." Hospitalizations and deaths from COVID-19 have been decreasing for a few weeks now in New York, and Lorenzoni is back on pediatrics. It's a welcome relief for now, but he says if there's another surge, he could be called back.

             Former President Barack Obama talks during a panel with NBA players in Chicago on Feb. 15. Former President Barack Obama delivered a virtual commencement address on Saturday, urging the tens of thousands of graduates from historically black colleges and universities to "seize the initiative" amid what he described as a lack of leadership from leaders in the United States to the coronavirus pandemic. "More than anything, this pandemic has fully, finally torn back the curtain on the idea that so many of the folks in charge know what they're doing," Obama said in remarks that were streamed online. "A lot of them aren't even pretending to be in charge. If the world's gonna be better, it's going to be up to you." Obama's remarks come as the virus has killed more than 88,000 Americans and crippled the nation's economy. He delivered them as part of "Show Me Your Walk HBCU Edition," a virtual commencement hosted Saturday by the comedian Kevin Hart. The event included a stream of prominent black athletes, politicians and entertainers — many of whom attended HBCUs themselves. While Obama's remarks were billed as a sendoff for graduating seniors — forced by the pandemic to leave campuses across the country and unable to participate in more traditional commencement ceremonies — Obama also appeared to bring the graduates together around a set of shared values. The former president made note of the disproportionate impact that the pandemic has had on black communities. Black Americans account for a disproportionate number of coronavirus-related deaths in the U.S. There have also been stark racial disparities in the economic impact of the outbreak.  Addressing these disparities, Obama said that coronavirus "spotlights the underlying inequalities and extra burdens that black communities have historically had to deal with in this country."  He also made reference to the killing of Ahmaud Arbery, the 25-year-old black man who was fatally shot in Georgia in February, saying there were disparities evident not just in public health, but "just as we see it when a black man goes for a jog, and some folks feel like they can stop and question and shoot him if he doesn't submit to their questioning." Obama praised the key role that historically black colleges play in the black community, telling graduates that now more than ever, they have the tools they need to seize their power to make change. Obama called on the 2020 class to be "bold" and have a "vision that isn't clouded by cynicism or fear." Taylor Harris, 22, who attended Hampton University, said she was glad to see Obama and others taking notice of HBCUs given their key role in educating a large population of low income and first-generation students.  "I feel like we don't get a lot of recognition — they kind of looked at as second tier compared to Ivy League schools or predominately white institutions," said Harris. "So I'm just glad that celebrities are taking the chance to embrace our young African-American graduates. There are so many statistics that we have overcome, just graduating for college." Harris left Hampton's campus nine weeks ago, and went home to St. Louis, assuming she'd be back on campus in a matter of weeks. "At first people were excited, it was like a little break," Harris said. "But as soon as I got back home and I knew that I couldn't return back to campus, now I'm living out of a suitcase." Hampton University is planning on holding a commencement ceremony for graduating seniors in September. Harris said that's a long way in the future, but she hopes she gets the opportunity to walk across the stage in front of her family and friends, and professors that she said became like family too. Obama's remarks on Saturday marked the first of three speeches he is scheduled to deliver to graduating students. On Saturday evening, the former president is slated to take part in a prime time special for high school graduates that will air on the major television networks. In June, Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama are also scheduled to speak at a commencement hosted by YouTube. Over the course of his presidency, Obama gave in-person commencement addresses at three historically black colleges: Hampton University, Howard University and Morehouse College. On Saturday, he said that graduates of such institutions are "inheritors of one of America's proudest traditions" and that "no generation has been better positioned to be warriors for justice and remake the world." Donethe Cyprien, 22, graduated from Morgan State University in Baltimore on Saturday. Since Morgan State ended in-person classes, she's been with family in Montgomery County, Maryland. "Honestly, it was sad," she said after participating in her virtual commencement. "Right now I'm supposed to be at school actually doing all of this. Instead, I'm watching my graduation in my bed and texting my friends." Cyprien said virtual commencements are a nice gesture, but can't replicate what she and other members of the class of 2020 have lost. "All those goodbyes, those hugs — all that was supposed to be happening in person."

             A newborn baby girl receives treatment for the gun wound in her right leg received during the attack on a maternity clinic in Kabul this week. The gunmen killed her mother. On Tuesday morning three gunmen stormed into a maternity clinic in Kabul, Afghanistan, run by Médicins Sans Frontières. They rampaged through the ward, going from room to room and shooting nurses, mothers and newborn babies. At least 16 people were killed. Afghans watched in terror as security forces began evacuating people from the ward and soldiers rushed out of the hospital, carrying infants wrapped in bloodstained blankets to waiting ambulances. Photos of dead mothers clutching their crying, tiny babies circulated online, alongside videos of desperate fathers and family members begging for information about their loved ones. While the attack was happening at the clinic, a suicide blast tore through a funeral more than 100 miles to the east in Nangarhar province. The attacker detonated a bomb that ripped through the gathering of hundreds of fasting mourners and families, killing at least 24 people. No one has claimed responsibility yet; the Taliban denied involvement in both assaults, according to an NPR report. This is the cycle of life and death in Afghanistan. Our people are targeted and killed on a daily basis. From the cradle to the grave, there is no respite. Today, the degree of violence and inhumanity we face every day is plastered all over Twitter and the news for the world to see. Afghan women are calling for an end to it. Since the U.S. began peace negotiations with the Taliban in February 2019, we, the women of Afghanistan at home and in the diaspora, have held protests, organized petitions and launched campaigns to demand our safety and rights. In response, we have been told by leaders, political commentators and officials that we are being unrealistic. That we are too loud, too demanding and an obstacle in the path toward peace in our country. We have been told to wait and to listen to men who, in the safety of their palaces and compounds, posture about the complexities of reaching peace. We have been told the Taliban will demonstrate their commitment to peace and that they will be an effective counter-terror partner. What demands have we made that warrant such a response? We are asking only for the safety to go to work without fearing that we will never be able to return to our homes. We are asking to be able to pray with our children and families, in mosques and temples, without the fear of being killed. We are asking that the basic freedoms of movement and opportunity for our mothers, our sisters and our friends, be respected and protected. We are asking that our children and newborn babies not be killed in their beds, in schools or in maternity wards, never once having drawn a breath in safety. Our children are being born into this violence and dying in this violence. Are we really asking too much? The brutality and killings of recent days demonstrate that the current peace process is a farce. The deal, signed on 29 February 2020 between the U.S. and the Taliban, was supposed to reduce the daily violence against Afghans. Despite this agreement, the Taliban have not stopped fighting. Irrespective of the identities of the perpetrators of these latest attacks, it is Taliban violence, networks and backers that create the cycle of violence. They are increasing their attacks on soldiers and civilians alike, killing Afghans daily. They have rejected repeated calls for a humanitarian ceasefire, even as the COVID-19 pandemic sweeps across the country. It is their criminal networks, their financiers and the people who benefit from the violence who have created and emboldened a culture of violence — and has brought us here to the burying of infants and their mothers. The pain and outrage of the Afghan people in response to this reckless and indiscriminate violence is not what stands in the way of peace. The true obstacle is the violence and those who perpetrate it. Today, we once again ask all international governments and institutions who have power and influence — the U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, the heads of state of the European Union, NATO and President Trump — to stop allowing Afghan lives to be used as pawns at the negotiating table. The time for posturing and pontification is over. We urgently ask that you come together and do everything in your power to push for an immediate ceasefire in Afghanistan. Do not tell us that this deadly compromise from February is the pathway to peace. There can be no peace without security, accountability and justice. We need to raise our collective voice and reject a world in which mothers and their newborn infants are a target. We need a ceasefire now.

             Georgianna Glose died last month of complications from the coronavirus. She stands in front of the Fort Greene Strategic Neighborhood Action Partnership, a nonprofit she founded nearly 25 years ago. Georgianna Glose, an outspoken advocate for the poor and disadvantaged and a nun who sounded the alarm on sexual abuse in the Roman Catholic Church, was a fixture in her longtime Brooklyn, N.Y., neighborhood of Fort Greene. Glose died last month at the age of 73 from complications linked to the coronavirus. "She embodied the spirit of our profession and of a progressive nun, and she did it her way," Teresa Theophano, a close friend of Glose, told NPR's Scott Simon. "She was a reverent woman with a hilariously irreverent streak. I loved that about her." Theophano worked with Glose at the Fort Greene Strategic Neighborhood Action Partnership, a nonprofit where Glose created educational programs aimed at mobilizing residents through literacy, job preparedness, and support for seniors and caregivers, among other services. "She was passionate about putting anti-racism into practice for white social workers and what it meant to collaborate with communities of color without taking on a white savior complex, especially in a gentrifying neighborhood that was just rife with tension and inequity," Theophano said. Glose, director and founder of the Fort Greene SNAP, was active in serving her community through the organization up until her final days. In a stunt he described as "classic Georgianna," Glose's friend Victor Ayala told The New York Times that she called him from the hospital, hoping he would take over her teaching duties at SNAP. "She's about to go under a respirator and she's calling to tell me what to do with the students," Ayala said. "Her humanity was just so alive." Glose left her convent of the Roman Catholic order, the Sisters of St. Dominic of Amityville, N.Y., in 1969 when she moved to Fort Greene, where she'd spent previous summers working alongside her sisters. There, Glose, along with two other sisters in her order, joined the priests of St. Michael-St. Edward Church. Glose, whose parents instilled the value of education in their three children from an early age, went on to earn a master's degree at Hunter College and a doctorate in Social Welfare from the City University of New York. According to The Times, she wrote her dissertation about the racism African American nuns faced in the Catholic community. While she studied and taught, she continued her social work in Brooklyn. An obituary from the Sisters of St. Dominic of Amityville cites an anecdote of the support network she arranged to keep elderly people connected. "In 1973 she set up a telephone reassurance service coordinating a staff of volunteers who would call, on a daily basis, seniors who lived alone. She asked for and received financial help from a number of our convents to cover the large monthly phone bill," the tribute read. In 1993, Glose learned about allegations of child sex abuse by a priest at the St. Michael-St. Edward parish. It strained Glose's trust in church leadership. In a 2017 interview with The Global Sisters Report, she called the revelations a "huge betrayal" for all three of the sisters who, after contacting potential victims and building more evidence of abuse within the institution, reported their findings to the Brooklyn Diocese. But they felt he hadn't taken proper action at the time. During those dark times, Glose said their faith and their social work kept them afloat. Theophano said her friend's whistleblowing is "an excellent example of the fearlessness that she put forth in all of her actions." Glose showed that doggedness could go hand-in-hand with gentleness. "She really stood up for her ideals and for other people," Theophano said. "But she was kind, and she was patient, at the same time that she didn't take any crap from anybody." Glose is survived by her younger sister Katherine and her older brother Steve.

             Pier Fries in Old Orchard Beach, Maine, was open and serving recently, but  a few restaurants have announced they will close permanently. Maine has seen one of the country's lowest rates of hospitalization and deaths from COVID-19, and the lowest in the entire Northeast. But its economy relies heavily on summer visitors — many from states where the virus is still rampant. With Memorial Day approaching, tourism businesses are worried summer may be over before it has begun. In the historic seaside summertime playground of Old Orchard Beach, it's spruce-up time. Workers are starting to open up the fry shacks, pizza parlors, and the town's many low-rise hotels. At the Waves Oceanfront resort, workers like Raksmey Yi and owner Ken Lafayette also have something else to worry about: the coronavirus. As lawnmowers and leaf blowers buzzed around them, they discussed set-up strategies that could help with social distancing. "So we're keeping some of the pools closed, we're not opening all of our pools," Lafayette said. "It's about the social distancing on the pool deck." They will tell people "you can't sit on the deck, only swim, in and out," Yi said, which drew a laugh. But when Yi suggests that those who want to sunbathe should head to the beach, Lafayette points out another concern: for now, at least, it's a "walking beach" where people must keep moving or face a possible citation. Such are the new concepts of the COVID-19 era that Maine's tourism leaders have to contend with. In March, Lafayette took a significant loan to buy a new property, based on its long history of repeat customers from Canada. But now President Trump has sealed the border indefinitely. Lafayette said sending back deposits has become almost a full-time job, and he's lost bookings worth at least half a million dollars. "So I almost feel like a failure," he said. "My brother will tell me it's not my fault, my wife tells me it's not my fault. But [with] all the optics and gauges that I use, it's just demoralizing." And it's discouraging as well for the 80-plus seasonal workers he'd planned for, whose job prospects are now uncertain. Tourists spend more than $6 billion a year here, supporting about one in seven jobs. The cascade of economic effects is being felt up and down the coast and far inland too, in an area called "The Forks," for instance, at the confluence of two major rivers where Suzie Hockmeyer pioneered the state's whitewater rafting industry back in the 1970s. "We're looking right down the gun barrel like a lot of people are," Hockmeyer said. Her river adventure resort, Northern Outdoors, should be ramping up for the season now — opening up the inn, cabins, campgrounds, restaurant and brewery. More than 100 workers make a buck here at the height of most seasons, with some 10,000 visitors taking on the rapids. But the inn is empty and the rafts are still in storage. Hockmeyer's trying to figure out how to maintain social distancing through all her operations, including on the water. "A boat is 16-feet-long, and it has four different thwarts," she said. "So if you kept people in the same household in the first few thwarts, you'd probably get almost a 6-foot distance between the guide and the people out front. It's possible we'll have to put a mask on the guide." If they even get the chance, that is. Commercial lodging in Maine is mostly shut down, except for essential workers. That changes next month, but visitors from out-of-state will have to quarantine in place for two weeks before doing anything else. The hospitality industry said few tourists would be willing to take that on, and the policy's led to thousands of cancellations. Leaders are begging state officials to modify or lift the restriction. Heather Johnson, Maine's commissioner of economic development, said the state is working with industry to design a multi-pronged strategy, including expanded testing for the virus, that could change the structure of the quarantine requirement. Much depends on the pandemic's progress in hard-hit Massachusetts, perhaps the single biggest contributor to Maine's tourist population. Johnson said it's a mistake to think an economy can thrive without robust public health protections. "I don't think there's an either-or proposition here," she said. "I think this will be a multi-layered response, and will take communities, industry and local leadership, which we're seeing a lot of." Johnson adds that recent research shows tourists planning future travel are looking for experiences that include outdoors "assets" in areas where there is space and strong safety practices. That portends well for the fall and next summer, she said. "We think that lines up really well with the Maine brand," she said. But, she adds,"we are not giving up on summer." Some businesses have though. One theme park in southern Maine said it won't reopen until next year, some restaurants say the same, and a few have already announced they will close permanently.

Meantime, tourist towns like Old Orchard are experimenting with ways to meet the needs of the day: closing streets to cut down on the density of sidewalk crowds, coordinating beach openings so no one area gets overwhelmed, creating new cleaning regimes for all-important public restrooms. On a recent day, Rocco Ferraiuolo was selling pizza as usual at his high-profile takeout shop on the town's main drag. "The world is crazy now, who was suspecting this?" he asked, wearing a mask and gloves as he floured and shaped pizza rounds. He said he's worried about making the rent. But he has some hope too. "You know, I think if everybody does the right thing, masks, the gloves, this and that, everybody can work,"Ferraiuolo said. "Everywhere, you know? In every shop." Another restaurant owner said it's not time to think outside of the box anymore; it's time for a whole new box.

             Gabe Silverman is sheltering at home with his family and this is the first Zoom mitzvah for Temple Shir Tikva, a congregation west of Boston. As Gabe Silverman chants his Torah portion, he's intensely focused on every word. It's the culmination of months of study and the high point of his Bar Mitzvah service. The same is true for almost every 12- or 13-year-old celebrating a bar or bat mitzvah. "For the Torah service, I was very nervous about, like, losing my place," Gabe said. "It's so big and all the letters look the same, basically." The Torah is rolled open on a table in his family's living room and positioned in front of a computer camera. Gabe is sheltering at home with his parents and younger brother and this is the first Zoom mitzvah for Temple Shir Tikva, a congregation located 20 miles west of Boston. May and June are popular months for bar and bat mitzvahs and many congregations schedule the Jewish coming-of-age ritual two to three years in advance. It takes time to learn Torah portions and prayers and to book venues and caterers for the celebration afterwards.  That makes postponing tough. Now, during the coronavirus pandemic, congregations are reimagining the ceremony and bringing it online. For family and friends watching Gabe's Zoom bar mitzvah, Gabe and the Torah occupy a central square flanked by Shir Tikva's rabbis and cantor.  Rabbi Danny Burkeman calls upon a few family members. They temporarily appear on screen for aliyot -- blessings over the Torah reading. Gabe's grandmother Helaine Silverman is honored with the first of the aliyot. Before Helaine begins, Burkeman reminds her to switch on her camera and unmute. Burkeman leads the service remotely from his synagogue's main sanctuary. He's doing double duty, making sure the ceremony follows tradition and monitoring all the technology involved. "Our aim was to create for them as much as possible a digital bar mitzvah experience," Burkeman said. "And we use the word digital because it wasn't virtual. There was nothing virtual about it. It was real."

             Rabbi Danny Burkeman delivers the Torah two days before the bar mitzvah. The Silvermans thought about postponing until the end of the year, but two weeks before the big day, they decided to go forward on Zoom on the original date. At that point, the most pressing question became: What elements of the bar mitzvah mattered most?  Gabe wanted to read from an actual Torah, not the sheets of paper he used for practice. Two days before his bar mitzvah, Burkeman made a special delivery. "Rabbi Danny just came to our driveway with the Torah seatbelted in the front seat," Gabe recalled. "It was wrapped up, seatbelted, and then he handed it off to my dad." At his bar mitzvah, as soon as Gabe finishes reading from that Torah, he looks at his parents, smiles and noticeably exhales. For him, the toughest part is over. Soon the entire service concludes. Then, Burkeman exhales. "I felt really good that we'd been able to give him an experience," Burkeman said. "And you could see in his face and in the face of his family that this was meaningful for them."

             Gabe wanted to read from an actual Torah, not the sheets of paper he used for practice. After the ceremony, family and friends turn on their cameras and unmute. They wave and hold up congratulatory signs and shout "Mazel Tov!" Reflecting on the bar mitzvah, Gabe's mom Erica is happy with the whole online event, but she knows it's not for everyone. "I'm very compassionate for people who are making the other decision to postpone and do it in person," she said. "But for us, in that moment, it was the right decision. It was more special because of the circumstances." As she talks, Erica sits next to Gabe and her husband Scott. The Torah is still there, a couple feet away on the dining room table. She glances over at the scroll and adds, "I feel very complete by what we experienced." Erica and Scott wonder if they'll need to celebrate with a big bar mitzvah party when family and friends can gather again. And Gabe?  "I hope that we can have a party," he said. "But I can do without." The pandemic has made the service — the actual religious ritual — the place where the most meaningful and memorable moments happen.

             President Trump stands during Game 5 of the World Series at Nationals Park in Washington, D.C., last October. Last month, President Trump said something a lot of sports fans can relate to. "You get tired of looking at nine-year-old baseball games, and playoff games that took place 12 years ago," he said. With the NBA and NHL seasons suspended, and Major League Baseball hitting pause mid-spring training, fans initially flocked to the classic games that ESPN and other sports networks resorted to re-airing to fill their schedules amid the coronavirus pandemic. As time has gone on, the sports world has grown increasingly antsy for live competition. As the MLB negotiates a partial, fan-less season with the players union, many baseball fans have been waking up early to follow the Korea Baseball Organization, which recently resumed play in empty stadiums. ESPN has resorted to airing live coverage of the beanbag game cornhole. The NFL has announced a fall schedule, but given no specifics about whether it expects to have fans in the seats.  But Trump has gone beyond the typical sports fan's laments. He's circled back, again and again, in appearance after appearance, to the idea of resuming play. "We want to have our sports leagues open. You want to watch sports. It's important," Trump said in April. "We miss sports. We miss everything. We want to get back." The president has held multiple calls with sports commissioners to encourage them to resume play, and several with ties to professional sports are among those the president has asked to weigh in on how to reopen the economy.  "He knows the American people are yearning for the things we used to take for granted, sports being a big one of them," said Ari Fleischer. He now works in sports communications, but was White House press secretary on Sept. 11, 2001, when terror attacks stopped sports and everything else. Fleischer said even with everything else they had to confront and plan for, senior White House staff paid close attention to when and how sports resumed play in mid-September.  "The president was personally very cognizant of the signal it would send to the American people: that we're back on our feet, you can resume your lives, put your fears aside, as soon as sports returned," said Fleischer, adding that "America without sports was like a heart that doesn't pump." Indeed, the return of baseball provided New York City — and the country at large — that signal that fall. First, catcher Mike Piazza powered the Mets to a comeback win over their nemesis, the Atlanta Braves, with a late-inning home run at the first game back in Shea Stadium. Then, the Yankees marched to their fourth-straight World Series with comeback after comeback, including two of the most iconic moments in Derek Jeter's career: a mind-bending defensive play against the Oakland A's that became known as "The Flip," and an extra-inning home run in the World Series.

             President George W. Bush threw out the ceremonial first pitch of Game 3 of the World Series in New York's Yankee Stadium in October 2001. President Bush himself provided one of the most memorable sports images in 2001, when he threw out the first pitch from the Yankee Stadium mound before Game 3 of the World Series. But as strange at it seems, it was easier to protect against terrorism than it is to protect against a virus: the very nature of a large gathering is dangerous, no matter what precautions are taken.  That's why officials from Dr. Anthony Fauci on down have warned that pro sports aren't advisable any time soon, especially with fans in the seats. "Safety, for the player and for the fans, trumps everything," Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told the New York Times last month."If you can't guarantee safety, then unfortunately you're going to have to bite the bullet and say, 'We may have to go without this sport for this season.' " "The prospect of mass gatherings is negligible at best, until we get to herd immunity and until we get to a vaccine," California Gov. Gavin Newsom recently said, in response to questions about whether play can resume this year.  If baseball begins play this summer — league officials are currently in talks with the players union — it would be in empty stadiums. That's how the Korea Baseball Organization and Germany's soccer league, Bundesliga, are proceeding.

             A cheerleader performs in front of a large screen displaying baseball fans cheering from their homes during the opening game of South Korea's new baseball season earlier this month. That's not what the president is pushing for, though. "When Alabama has a football game against LSU, I don't want 20,000 people in the stands with seven empty seats in between everybody," he recently told ABC News. "I want 110,000 people like they got." "I hope we can do that soon," said Trump, who in recent days has begun downplaying the importance of both pervasive testing to resuming normal life.  "President Trump is eager to see Americans back to work, businesses back open, and families and friends able to support their favorite teams. The President is hopeful that sports will be able to return quickly and safely at all levels." White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said in a statement to NPR. "As our resilient country defeats coronavirus, we are confident that sports will continue to strengthen and unite all Americans."  Still, even the sports world isn't united around the concept of resuming games. Washington Nationals pitcher Sean Doolittle has been outspoken on his concerns about safety. He recently told The Athletic's Starkville podcast that he's also worried about the message games would send. "You know, look, these guys are playing baseball, and sports are back. So everything has returned to normal," he envisioned many fans thinking. "And then all of the sudden we break social distancing measures and we stop home quarantine too soon. And then it spikes again and it gets out of control." In that sense, instead of uniting, sports is once again mirroring the broader culture — showing increasing divides on how to proceed in a pandemic that shows no signs of ending soon.Knock knock. "Come in," Ms. H calls out. I step into her room triple-protected — wearing my N95 mask, a surgical mask and an eye shield. I introduce myself as her doctor, my voice barely audible among the chorus of loud alarms blaring from a hospital monitor. It's signaling that her IV infusion has finished. I tune out the sounds — I hear them all the time — but I can tell that she is frustrated. She's not getting any sleep or rest. I glance at the monitor and quickly press "silence," giving her momentary relief from the noise. In a momentary lapse, I hold out my hand for a handshake, then pull it back. "How are you doing?" I ask instead. The pain medications are not working very well, she tells me. I frown, but my downturned mouth is hidden beneath my three masks. All she can see are my eyes, and even then, she sees them through the glare of the protective shield. Ms. H had come to our hospital in bad shape. She had significant bleeding inside her abdomen, requiring my colleagues to perform emergency life-saving surgery. Many patients do not survive what she's gone through, and I'm relieved just to see her alive. Still, I'm also upset to see her in so much pain. "Hang in there," I tell her as I leave. It feels as if I'm talking to myself as much as to her. The encounter was frustrating. From the very early stages of our medical training, we are taught about the importance of bedside manners. Eye contact. Smile. Perhaps a handshake or a pat on the shoulder. These gestures can be as simple as sitting in a veteran's room for an extra five minutes to listen to World War II stories. Or listening with a young cancer patient to a song by our shared favorite band. Or clutching a sick patient's shoulder and reassuring him that he will see his three daughters again. These gestures acknowledge a patient's humanity. It gives them some semblance of normalcy in an otherwise difficult period in their lives. Selfishly, that human connection also helps us — the doctors, nurses and other health care providers — deal with the often frustrating nature of our stressful jobs. Since the start of the pandemic, our bedside interactions have had to be radically different. Against our instincts, and in order to protect our patients and colleagues, we tend to spend only the necessary amount of time in our patients' rooms. And once inside, we try to keep some distance. I have stopped holding my patients' hands. I now try to minimize small talk. No more whimsical conversational detours. Our interactions now are more direct and short. I have, more than once, felt guilty for how quickly I've left a patient's room. This guilt is worsened, knowing that patients in hospitals don't have family and friends with them now either. Doctors are supposed to be there for our patients, but it's become harder than ever in recent months. I understand why these changes are needed. As I move through several hospital floors, I could unwittingly transmit the virus if I'm infected and don't know it. I'm relatively young and healthy, so if I get the disease, I will likely recover. But what about my patients? Some have compromised immune systems. Most are elderly and have more than one high-risk medical condition. I could never forgive myself if I gave one of my patients COVID-19. So I am excessively careful. As always, we must adapt during tough times. If we want to preserve the bedside manners that can help our patients heal, our words matter more than ever. "I am here for you." "I want you to know that I will do everything I can to make you better." "What can I do to make you more comfortable?" "Did what I just talked about make sense? Did you want me to repeat anything?" I have relied on these words in recent times. And it works. Patients, almost universally, appreciate the extra effort, and it paves the way for good rapport. Beyond what we say, there are other ways to maintain good bedside manners. I have started showing my ID badge — which has my picture — to every patient I meet, so they know what I really look like. I have become mindful of leaving the room more ergonomically helpful for my patients than when I entered — such as moving the call bell or the bedside table within their reach. Some of my colleagues have started pausing to call into patient rooms as they walk by throughout the day — just to check in on them more often. Most patients say these changes make a difference. It's certainly made a difference for Ms. H. The day after my first visit, I stand outside her closed door, putting on protective gear, and place my ear a few inches from the door before entering. No alarms this time. Knock knock. She invites me in — and looks a lot better. She finally got some sleep, Ms. H tells me, but she wishes that the hospital food tasted better. I instantly relate, letting out a laugh. She seems to be in good spirits. "Thank you, doctor, for what you are doing," she says as I get ready to step out. I look up to see her smiling. I smile back. "You just made my day, Ms. H, so thank you," I tell her. As I close the door behind me, I, too, am feeling more optimistic. Together, we are getting through this pandemic and its forced estrangement, day by day. Soon enough, everything will be OK.

             Rob Grier says if he weren't taking care of him, his dad, Robert Grier Sr., would probably need to be in a nursing home. Macabre news of bodies stacked in a makeshift morgue. Federal emergency teams swooping in to take control of state veterans homes where the coronavirus has killed scores. For veterans, getting care in their own homes has gone from a preference to a matter of survival. "It's definitely scary," says Rob Grier.  His father, Robert Grier Sr., served in Korea and Vietnam, and Rob says if he weren't taking care of him, his dad would probably need to be in a nursing home. The VA has been good to them over the years, Rob says, especially when his father got lung cancer. "We were just blessed to have a great team at the VA during his care for that, "he says, "but still, a pre-existing condition, that's not good for COVID."  Grier wants to keep taking care of his dad, but he's not sure he can without help from the VA caregiver program, which is not yet open to older veterans. Since 2011 the VA has helped caregivers with a stipend, but only for Iraq and Afghanistan vets. In 2018 the VA MISSION Act promised to expand to veterans of Korea and Vietnam, and eventually all veterans who need it. But who needs it? The VA finally announced its highly technical answer to that question in March after a two-year wait. Anyone with at least a 70% disability rating from the VA can apply. It's now available to veterans disabled by illness, not just injury. That's particularly important to Vietnam vets suffering from cancer and other diseases linked to the defoliant Agent Orange.  VA says this will significantly expand the program. Veterans advocates had a mixed reaction to the 56 pages of newly proposed rules. "This looks to me like a significant restriction of eligibility for the program," said Bob Carey, a navy vet with the Independence Fund. Carey says under the rules, vets qualify if they need help with one basic activity like eating or bathing, but only if they need help every single time they do it. And the caregiver in the program has to be doing all the vet's care and supervision, or they don't qualify. Carey says he's afraid rules like that will keep thousands of deserving vets out. "We and other (Veterans Service Organizations) have been pushing for a long time for fundamental reforms to the caregiver program, and none of those were addressed," Carey says. Among their requested changes was a permanent designation for catastrophically injured vets, so they don't have to check in yearly to reconfirm their status. "I've been missing the same three limbs since June 26, 1965," says Dennis Joyner, who lost his legs and one arm to a landmine in Vietnam. He'd like to be able to get his wife Donna on to the new expanded caregiver program. After taking care of him for decades, she finally had to quit her full time job in 2008. "I gave up my job, my pension. It's just everything that snowballed from that," she says. "You take on a lot when you're a caregiver.  I might be getting older, but I'm doing probably more than ever."  The Joyners got excited in 2018 when Congress voted to expand the caregiver program to include Vietnam-era vets.    "They passed it, the president signed it.  I'm thinking wow, I'm ready to go file," Dennis Joyner says. "Well, talk about taking the wind out of your sail — it's been a couple years now." Joyner is pretty sure he'll qualify, but he still can't apply - the VA estimates that the new IT system to run the caregiver program won't be ready until later summer or early fall. The VA is not starting this process with a great foundation of trust — the current caregiver program was administered inconsistently, and the now the new one has kept older vets waiting — some have died since the law passed in 2018. "Delay, deny, until they die," says Rick Weidman, with Vietnam Veterans of America. "It shouldn't have been this complicated." He says VA shouldn't need a new IT system to see that a triple amputee like Joyner needs a caregiver. But the VA and many in congress have agreed that getting the system to work well is just as urgent as getting it done soon. "When you expand to a very different population the challenges grow exponentially," says Meg Kabat, the former director of the caregiver program, now with Atlas Research. Kabat says it's crucial for the VA to be transparent in how it implements the caregiver expansion. "If I'm the caregiver of a veteran, I have to have a sense of whether we're going to qualify even before we apply. To do that VA has to make it crystal clear, more black and white," Kabat says. "It's a trade-off, though. The result of that may be that some veterans who were in the program previously may no longer meet that criteria."

             House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., walks past the Statuary Hall ahead of floor debate on a record $3 trillion coronavirus response package Friday to fund the fight against the pandemic and provide emergency payments to millions of Americans. House lawmakers on Friday approved a Democratic proposal to provide $3 trillion in coronavirus relief that would include a new wave of help for state and local governments, workers and families.  The House voted 208 to 199 —  largely along party lines — to pass the measure. The size of the bill represents the biggest ever proposed and it includes another round of direct cash payments to Americans, extends unemployment benefits to the end of January, and adds hazard pay for front-line workers. It also expands virus-testing efforts, contact tracing and treatment. "This is a very strategically planned piece of legislation that is tailored strictly to meet the needs of the American people regarding the coronavirus pandemic," House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said on the House floor ahead of the vote. "To do anything less would not be responsible."  Most Republicans derided the bill as a wish list from House Democrats to push ahead of November's election. Bipartisan talks have stalled with the GOP-led Senate and the Trump administration.  Pelosi maintained the measure is focused on reopening the economy, but the plan is dead on arrival in the Senate. Still, Democrats say it showcases a starting line for talks for more fiscal stimulus as the pandemic worsens its economic and public health toll. The legislation weaves together a long list for policies Democrats have pushed over its 1,800-plus pages, addressing gaps they feel left behind by four previous bipartisan packages approved since March. So far, Congress has passed about $3 trillion in aid.  Now, Republicans say members should pause to evaluate how the previous bills are working, and not rush into another plan that will pile more onto the deficit. "Instead of going big, it seems you went crazy," House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif. said on the floor Friday. "This is a political messaging bill that has no chance of becoming law."  McCarthy, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and other Republicans are also insisting any new effort include liability protections for businesses and individuals, a move Democrats oppose. On Thursday, the Trump administration quickly issued a veto warning if the Democratic bill reaches the president's desk. The statement noted that previous plans have won White House support.  "This proposed legislation, however, is more concerned with delivering on longstanding partisan and ideological wishlists than with enhancing the ability of our Nation to deal with the public health and economic challenges we face," the administration's policy statement argues. And the effort drew some opposition among some moderate and progressive Democrats. Progressive members, such as Washington State Rep. Pramila Jayapal, raised alarm the bill didn't go far enough. And moderate Reps. Abigail Spanberger of Virginia, Joe Cunningham of South Carolina and Cindy Axne of Iowa said the bill went too far.   "Unfortunately, many Members of Congress — including some in my own party — have decided to use this package as an opportunity to make political statements and propose a bill that goes far beyond pandemic relief and has no chance at becoming law, further delaying the help so many need," Spanberger said.  Most Democrats referred to the legislation as a follow-up to the CARES Act, which was approved in March, but it is not seen as the final action that Congress will have to take in response to the coronavirus. The legislation, just released Tuesday, provides large sums for policies that go beyond that earlier proposal. It directs nearly $1 trillion to state, local and tribal governments, including $500 billion in direct, flexible aid for state governments and an additional $357 billion for local governments and counties. And it adds $200 billion in pandemic hazard pay for essential workers and $75 billion for coronavirus testing, contact tracing and treatment efforts. Many Senate Republicans have criticized the push for more state assistance, arguing that any new money needs to be tied to the pandemic and not help address budget issues that predated the crisis. "It still reads like the speaker of the House pasted together random ideas from her most liberal members and slapped the word 'coronavirus' on top of it," McConnell said of the House bill a day earlier on the Senate floor.  The bill also includes some changes to programs that were approved in the CARES Act, including an expansion of the IRS payment program. Democrats want more generous benefits for families, including a $1,200 payment for each dependent. The CARES Act limits payments to $500 per child; adults or other dependents do not currently qualify. In all, the Democratic bill provides up to $6,000 per household. In addition, the plan sets aside $3.6 billion to protect federal elections, $25 billion to support the U.S. Postal Service, $100 billion for low-income rent support, $75 billion for a homeowner assistance fund and $100 million for the Violence Against Women Prevention and Prosecution Programs. And it expands funding for small-business loans, enhances an employee-retention tax credit program and boosts worker protections. The HEROES Act, which stands for the Health and Economic Recovery Omnibus Emergency Solutions Act, also extends emergency family and medical leave until the end of 2021. Doing so is part of their broader focus on child care and family support. The official scorekeepers at the Congressional Budget Office estimate that the earlier version of the leave provisions, which passed in March and extend through the end of this year, would themselves cost $105 billion. The latest proposal would more than double the length of those benefits. Republicans have already rejected many elements of the bill, including a suspension of the cap on the state and local tax deduction that was approved as part of the 2017 GOP-led tax cuts. Pelosi conceded Thursday she hasn't talked with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin — her administration contact in previous negotiations — since the bill was released. However, she's bullish that Republicans, including the Trump White House, will come around for a deal on a fifth bill.  "I do think, and have confidence, that our colleagues on both sides of the aisle, both sides of the Capitol and even down Pennsylvania Avenue know ... the hardship the American people are feeling, that they need that cash that we're sending," Pelosi told reporters Thursday. "I'm optimistic that the American people will weigh in and make their views known and, again, we want to do this working together, predicated on initiatives that have passed in a bipartisan way before."  Earlier Friday, the House also voted along party lines to approve historic changes to their ability to vote and attend hearings remotely during the pandemic. In a vote of 217 to 189, they green-lighted a plan to vote by proxy and hold hearings by video conference despite Republican objection.  Many members voted for the measures on Friday donning masks, and under new social distancing requirements that stretched the votes into a daylong affair.

             New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced today that the NYPD will no longer require people to wear masks in public, unless the absence of a mask presents a "serious danger." He's seen here on March 31. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio today announced police will no longer require people to wear masks in public, unless the absence of a mask presents a "serious danger." The decision is part of a "reset" of the NYPD's enforcement of emergency rules during the pandemic, following a number of  controversial encounters between officers and members of the public, some of them caught on video. The most recent was a confrontation between officers and a woman in a subway station, over whether she was wearing her mask properly. At the same time, de Blasio says police will continue to enforce rules against large gatherings, because he says it's a matter of "saving lives." Advocacy groups have complained that the NYPD's social distancing enforcement has been unfair and even racist, because about ninety percent of the people arrested in encounters related to social distancing enforcement have been black or Hispanic.  "The NYPD shouldn't be thrown at this particular pandemic — at this health problem," says David Galarza, a volunteer with a police watchdog group called the Justice Committee. "It only leads to more criminalization and violence against our people, people of color." The city has pushed back on the racism charge, pointing out that in nearly a million police encounters with the public over social distancing, only a few dozen people have been arrested, and usually for unrelated infractions. Earlier this week, the mayor said the role of police in the pandemic had become an "ideological issue," but he insisted officers should remain "part of the equation." "That is my decision, that's what we are doing," he said. "Because we cannot have a situation where social distancing comes unglued because there's no enforcement." But it's not just left-of-center activists calling for police to back off; online, conservative groups are circulating the video of a Port of Seattle police officer named Greg Anderson, sitting in his patrol car, in uniform, calling on his fellow officers not to enforce "tyrannical orders against the people." "Every time time I look to the internet, I'm seeing people arrested or cited for going to church, for traveling on the roadways, for going surfing," he says in the video. "What you're doing is you're widening the gap between public trust and law enforcement officers." The Port of Seattle has put Anderson on paid administrative leave while it investigates him for violating its social media policy. Police departments are worried about getting caught in the political cross-fire over social distancing. Texas governor Greg Abbott recently went on Fox News to criticize big city police departments in his state for enforcing the state's emergency rules too aggressively. "In Houston, they were issuing fines and potential jail time for anybody who refused to wear a mask," he said. The Houston police department says it never issued any fines and made no arrests related to masks, and Chief Art Acevedo accused the governor of "hypocrisy," saying Abbott was trying to score political points with his conservative base at the expense of the police. "The men and women in blue don't need leaders who are more interested in politics than in public safety," Acevedo told NPR. He says enforcing the governor's emergency order will not be a "law enforcement priority" for his department. Sue Rahr, a former sheriff who runs the police academy in Washington state, says public health enforcement is an awkward assignment for police, especially in the current political environment. "Clearly, the public is not united on what should be done in the community to keep people safe from the virus," she says. "And so the cops really do get trapped in the middle." One solution may be to move officers back from the front lines of  enforcement. In Florida, the city of Clearwater is using civilian "ambassadors" to roam the beaches remind the public to keep social distance, while the police hang back. Police chief Dan Slaughter says the intention is to put communication ahead of enforcement."All that communication is to avoid the officer having to get involved in something that we would quite honesty wish we would not have to be involved in," he says.It's an approach being tried in New York, too. Despite Mayor de Blasio's insistence that the NYPD stay in the mix, he says the city is also preparing to send out about 2,300 civilian ambassadors to remind New Yorkers to keep their distance,  as the weather warms up.

             A restaurant in Ohio, Taste of Belgium, seats customers outside as businesses begin to reopen in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic on Friday. One month ago, the White House announced principles for reopening the country. Soon after, governors who felt they weren't getting enough federal guidance banded together to coordinate regional reopening plans.  Michigan's Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, for example, told NPR last month that she'd been in regular contact with the governors of Illinois, Minnesota, Wisconsin and Ohio.  "We know that COVID-19 doesn't respect party lines and it doesn't respect state lines, and that's why we've got to share our best information and move strategically together whenever possible," she said on All Things Considered.  Now, many of those national and regional plans seem to have evaporated. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention put out guidance Thursday, but those are just recommendations. As a result, many businesses and customers are navigating a convoluted jumble of rules that change as you cross city, county and state lines.  The patchwork is most pronounced in the center of the country. 'People Need To Have The Courage To Go Out' Ed Brownell owns about a dozen Spin pizzerias around Kansas City. Within the same metropolitan area, some are in the state of Kansas, others in Missouri.  "The rules up to this point have changed, sometimes day to day, but certainly week to week," says Brownell. "They either extend the close orders or they change what they're requiring us to do to reopen, so that's been very difficult to navigate." 
                Ed Brownell's dozen or so pizzerias in the Kansas City area straddle Kansas and Missouri.

             Ed Brownell's dozen or so pizzerias in the Kansas City area straddle Kansas and Missouri. Brownell says Kansas City, Mo., originally planned to allow eateries to open at 50% capacity. Now, the governor has allowed much of Missouri to reopen, but the Kansas City mayor has enacted what he calls a "10-10-10 rule." That means Brownell can allow either 10 people into a location at a time, or 10% of the restaurant's total capacity. If customers are in the building for more than 10 minutes, he is required to log their name and contact information for contact tracing. "That's probably the most onerous," Brownell says. "Some (municipalities) are requiring 25% capacity, some of them are 50% capacity, and then, gloves and masks and then marks on your floor to make sure the guests don't come within 6 feet of each other." Two of Brownell's restaurants just opened again on Monday, but not many people showed up for lunch. He has 500 employees. If things don't pick up soon, he's afraid for them and the future of his business. "People need to have the courage to go out and participate and take the proper precautions," Brownell says. "But I think keeping our head in the sand is not going to do us much good long term. There won't be much to come out to if we keep this going long." Is 'Turning A Quick Buck' Worth The Risk?  Lora Moore has a different perspective. In Indiana, she and her husband own MDG salon studio and the Black Orchid barber lounge. The two locations are a short drive from each other.

             Lora Moore and her husband own MDG salon studio and the Black Orchid barber lounge. One in Indianapolis, the other just over the border in Carmel. Moore has decided not to reopen either location. But there's a catch: One's in the city of Indianapolis, the other just over the border in Carmel.  Carmel has a Republican mayor, and salons and barbershops there are open — as in much of Indiana. Indianapolis has a Democratic mayor, and the outbreak is worse there, so he's keeping salons and barbershops closed. Moore has decided not to reopen either location. "Is opening this soon just to turn a quick buck or two, is it really worth it? And the answer at the end of the day was no, it's not," Moore says. "So we pushed our date back to June 1 and there are many salons that followed suit. We're really proud of that movement." Moore says the lack of clear guidance has put business owners in a tough spot. On Monday, many barber shops in Carmel were open and full all day. "From the beginning, we were like, someone give us some direction here," she says. "And it's been pretty cloudy, but we're doing our best to navigate that." Crossing State Lines For Services  To many business owners and customers, this patchwork feels arbitrary and unscientific.  Becky Olsen of Plymouth, Mich., decided she's going to talk her 2-year-old golden retriever Finn across the border for a haircut.

             Becky Olsen of Plymouth, Mich. is taking her dog Finn, a 2-year-old golden retriever, to Ohio for a haircut. So Olsen is going to drive 45 minutes from Michigan — where groomers are closed — to one in Toledo, Ohio, which is open.  "The grooming salon we're going to ... told us they've had a ton of people from Michigan call them," she says. "They're bringing their animals down there to be groomed because they can't get them done here in Michigan." Olsen says she thinks it's safe to do what she's doing, noting that people are going to places like the grocery store and hardware stores. "Bringing my dog to the groomers ... if there is a drop-off, someone is picking up the dog from my car, very limited contact, they're going to do the service and bring the dog back to my car, I feel that is very safe and secure and I don't feel bad at all going to Ohio," she says. "I just feel bad that my groomer's going to lose money from me going to another place." 'When Were We Ever Considered?' COVID-19 has disproportionately affected people of color. And Orlando Watson believes the policymakers rushing to reopen the economy are not listening to African Americans like him.   Watson owns a St. Louis restaurant called Prime 55. He has cancer, which has compromised his immune system, so he's especially careful.   Most of Missouri is open. In St. Louis, restaurants remain closed. Watson doesn't know what he's going to do when the time comes to reopen, which could be as soon as next week.  "I've been real cautious and reluctant to get out," he says as he spray-painted patio furniture he hopes to use when his restaurant reopens. "This is probably my third time getting out during this whole time, minus going to the doctor." Watson says he's avoided people and characterizes this as a time of "extreme anxiety" for him.

             Orlando Watson owns a St. Louis restaurant called Prime 55. He has cancer, which has compromised his immune system, so he's especially careful. He says policymakers at the state level who have decided to reopen Missouri aren't acting with the African American community in mind. "When were we ever considered when policies were made?" Watson says. "I think that at the end of the day, money is going to outweigh safety. There's going to be casualties behind this country not having a better plan in place and really attacking this from day one." Missouri's Republican governor, Mike Parson told NPR last month this "phased approach" to reopening makes sense when you look at where people are getting sick and dying.   "What we did here in the St. Louis region, we knew that we needed to put resources up there — mobile testing sites — but that's not happening in rural areas of the state," he said on All Things Considered. "And those cases are not there, and they haven't been there." Frustration At Lack Of National Policy But many policymakers feel that a public health challenge of this magnitude should have a cohesive national strategy.  Greg Fischer is a Democrat, and mayor of Louisville, Ky., where many businesses are still closed. Across the Ohio River, much of Indiana is open for business — even though, Fischer says, the case rates and death rates are about four times that of Kentucky while Indiana's  population is just 50% more.  "There's no question [reopening] is not nearly as aligned as what it should be," he says. Fischer says that's a problem happening all over the country. "I don't think it's a bi-state issue, it's more of a national issue," Fischer says. "Ideally, we would have a national policy here so that we're all singing in concert. ... We realize that's not the case. Cities and states are on their own, so we're building that capacity from the ground up. I think we're doing a good job from what we have to work with, but it's too bad we couldn't have a more aligned national strategy around this. ... That's my frustration." There are experiments happening all over the country right now. The stakes are high. There is no precedent. And it will be weeks, or months, until the results are known.

             Cynthia Murray's hours at Walmart had already been cut, and she was worried about her health in the pandemic. After a customer shouted at her, she decided to go on unpaid leave. Updated on May 17 at 10:55 a.m. ET Cynthia Murray has worked at a Walmart store in Maryland for nearly 20 years, most of them as a fitting room associate. Her 64th birthday was fast approaching when the coronavirus pandemic hit and Walmart workers were suddenly "essential." Murray started worrying about her health and wondered whether she should keep working every time she looked at customers who came into the store. "You could see it in customers' faces — the panic," she says. "Don't get me wrong, some of our customers are awesome ... they appreciated us being there. ... But you could see the panic, and it's really eerie." FACES OF THE CORONAVIRUS RECESSION  Jobs lost. Businesses in peril. Meetings gone virtual. Faces Of The Coronavirus Recession offers snapshots of working Americans whose lives have been upended by the pandemic.  Murray's daughter, too, worried about her mother getting sick from being around so many customers and advised her to stay home. But Murray kept telling herself she had bills and rent coming due. Murray, who's part of the labor group United for Respect, says the store had cut back her hours in recent years, making it harder to accumulate paid time off – she says it takes her more than a week of work to earn one hour of sick time.  But one angry customer put her over the edge. She says the man shouted and demanded access to the fitting rooms, which have been shut as Walmart tries to limit the spread of the virus. The next day, Murray went on unpaid leave. "I just really felt uncomfortable," she says. "Whether I get paid or not, I'll just have to suffer whatever consequences." Editor's note: Walmart is among NPR's financial supporters.  Read more stories in Faces Of The Coronavirus Recession.

             Passengers wear masks on a Myanmar National airlines flight out of Yangon. Many airlines now require passengers to don masks. Each week we answer pressing coronavirus questions. For this week's installment, we're focusing on flying. We'd like to hear what you're curious about. Email us at goatsandsoda@npr.org with the subject line: "Weekly Coronavirus Questions." Since the coronavirus began its spread around the world, the number of people flying has nosedived. In the U.S., for example, the number of flyers has dropped more than 90% since the beginning of March.  TSA screened 234,928 travelers on Thursday, compared with 2,611,324 people on the same weekday a year earlier. With some countries and states are starting to allow businesses to reopen and lifting stay-at-home orders, people are wondering about the risks of flying. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance urges avoiding travel as much as possible, "especially if your trip is not essential .... Don't travel if you are sick or travel with someone who is sick." Travel increases your chances of getting and spreading COVID-19, the CDC  states.  Dr. Mark Gendreau, chief medical officer at Beverly Hospital in Massachusetts and a professor of emergency medicine at Tufts University, agrees: Even as some restrictions start to lift, he believes that it's still not a great time to take a flight for, say, a beach vacation. "If you're going for a vacation, it might be a good idea to postpone it for a little longer and by a little longer I would say another couple of months. We still have a lot of [viral] activity out there," he says. Here are answers to some of the commonly asked questions about flying.  What do I need to think about before making a decision to fly — or not? Determine whether the trip is necessary — and worth the risk and hassle. "It's up to individual travelers to decide what is really urgent and necessary," says Dr. Henry Wu, a professor of infectious disease medicine at Emory University and director of its TravelWell Center. "While traveling in an aircraft, you may be around people from all over the world, whether on the plane or at the airport. There will always be some risk at this point, and it's going to be very difficult to determine how high." He says personal protective measures like face coverings, hand hygiene and keeping social distance all help to reduce the transmission rate of the virus — but cautions that these measures don't eliminate risk entirely. To determine whether it's smart to fly, suggests Wu, start with a self-assessment: "Your medical background, your age and whether or not you have risk factors for severe complications." Second, evaluate the importance of the trip. In certain instances – say if you want to visit a dying family member or greet a new grandchild – you may feel strongly that you should go. Other situations may be discretionary. Third, evaluate your own tolerance for risk and inconvenience. Some states and countries require a 14-day quarantine period for arriving visitors – Hawaii, for example, requires all arriving plane passengers to stay home or in their lodging for 14 days after arriving and monitor their health, with a possible $5,000 fine or year in prison for violators.  The CDC continues to advise a 14-day quarantine when you get home from international travel. "I think everyone has to sort of do a little soul-searching to see what their risk tolerance is and the importance of the trip and their ability to take protective measures," Wu says. How stressful will it be? Airplanes are confined spaces. Someone seated near you on the plane could start sneezing or coughing uncontrollably — which could cause you anxiety. Make sure you are prepared for the mental stress of an environment that is not fully within your control during a global pandemic. The last time this reporter flew was in early March. It was not a relaxing experience: I was crammed in a full plane, highly aware of any stray cough or sneeze (including my own) and with no way to know if someone sitting near me might be carrying the virus. It was a relief to land. Gendreau says that your risk within a confined space like an airplane comes down to three factors: the duration of your exposure, your proximity to the source of the exposure and how infectious that source is. While there's no way to eliminate that risk, there are steps you can take to reduce your chance of picking up an illness on board. If I do fly, do I need to wear a mask? While there's still much that isn't known about COVID-19, the virus is believed to spread primarily through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes, according to the CDC. Masks can protect you from spraying your fellow passengers with droplets if you cough or sneeze and can also protect your mouth and nose from the droplets of others. All major U.S. airlines, and some overseas, now require employees and passengers to wear face coverings during flights except when eating or drinking. Very young children are exempted as are those with medical conditions that prevent wearing a face covering.  Your mask should cover your nose and mouth and not be too loose, Wu says. Be sure your hands are clean when putting the mask on and taking it off, and always wash or sanitize your hands after removing your mask.  Can you practice social distancing on a plane? As airlines have cut flights, some planes in recent weeks have been quite full. After an outcry from the public, airlines are now taking steps to promise travelers they'll have more space: Many do not seating passengers in middle seats on any flights, and if space allows, are seating passengers every other row. Bethany Long Newman flew on American from Chicago to Charleston, W.Va. in late April. On her flight from Chicago to Charlotte, "Everyone had their own row, and they put an empty row in between people."  But the situation was more haphazard on her next flight, aboard a smaller plane from Charlotte to Charleston: "When we boarded, there was a flight attendant that just said, 'You can sit wherever you want." Newman and her two family members family took a seat, but then someone sat down directly behind them, spurring Newman and her family to move elsewhere. That's smart. Wu says it's easier to stay spread apart now, with fewer people flying, but that will be more challenging if and when travel picks up. United Airlines says that beginning next week until the end of June, it will aim to inform passengers 24 hours before departure if their flight will be more than 70% full. Customers can opt to rebook on a different flight or receive a travel credit.  What's the safest seat to select? People sitting on the aisle are more likely to be in contact with other passengers and crew members as they walk down the aisle or take something out of the overhead bins.   "If it's a crowded flight," Gendreau says, "you can't go up those aisles without accidentally touching someone who's just seated there." Those passengers by the window are also less likely to get up during the flight to use the bathroom or move around – activities that can also expose you to other people and surfaces. Gendreau says in this era of not-so-crowded flights, he'd go for a window or middle seat instead of an aisle. Wu's pick? "Wherever is the most distant from others." Do I need to bring hand sanitizer? And when should I use it? "Hand gel: don't leave home without it," says Gendreau. He says the germiest places on airplanes are often the bathroom faucet handle, the slider that locks the lavatory door and the magazine pockets and tray tables. If you use the lavatory, use sanitizer gel on your hands after you return to your seat, to remove germs from surfaces like the door lock. Wu says it's important to stay aware of what you're touching: "If you touch anything that may not be clean, which is virtually everything that's not on yourself, be mindful of that," he says, and sanitize your hands when needed.  He says that in general, it's not a bad idea to carry around a pen to touch elevator buttons and the like, instead of using your fingers. Though then you need to be aware that you're carrying around a dirty pen. Should I do any pre-emptive wiping? Wipe down surfaces in your area. Airlines have stepped up their cleaning procedures of aircraft cabins, disinfecting them with fogging machines that spray disinfectant. Staff come through again with cleaning supplies to clean cabin surfaces like seat belts, window shades, tray tables and seat-back screens.  Your airline might provide disinfecting wipes and hand sanitizer as you board, but you may want to bring your own in case it doesn't. Gendreau hasn't flown since the arrival of COVID-19, but he was already in habit of bringing wipes and sanitizer gel.  "I'd just clean my seat back tray, my gasper [air vent], my seat belt. Then I'd wipe down where the magazine stuff was," he said. "Then I'd dispose of that wipe, take out my gel and sanitize my hands." When you use hand sanitizer,  use several drops and rub for at least 20 seconds. What if my face gets itchy? Don't touch it. Sanitize your hands, put on your mask and adjust it so it's comfortable — and then leave it alone. "If I've got an itchy eye or something, it's my forearm that's getting it unless I sanitize my hand," says Gendreau. How effective are cabin air filters? "The good news is that airline aircraft air circulation is very good," says Wu, "and it is constantly being filtered and circulated." Most aircraft used by U.S. airlines use high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filtration systems. "This type of air filter can theoretically remove at least 99.97% of dust, pollen, mold, bacteria and any airborne particles with a size of 0.3 microns," the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency says. "Particles that are larger or smaller are trapped with even higher efficiency."  The CDC says, "Because of how air circulates and is filtered on airplanes, most viruses and other germs do not spread easily." But those air filters are not going to protect you from a sneeze that lands right on you. "My main concern would be my individual row, as well as the two rows in front and back — that's roughly your six-foot radius," Wu says. "Even if the air is well-circulated and filtered, if somebody is just really coughing or sneezing within vicinity, it certainly does increase the chance of some exposure or contamination of the area around you." What preventive measures can I take if someone starts coughing or sneezing a lot? If someone is hacking nearby, hopefully they're wearing a mask. If they're sitting close to you, you might want to move seats if possible. If you can't, Gendreau says, try to convert your mask into one that seals more tightly against your face. He suggests a technique demonstrated by a former Apple engineer, in which three rubber bands are stretched over top of a mask to create a seal over the mouth and nose.  Gendreau would also reach up and turn on the adjustable air duct above your head, known as a gasper. He recommends turning it to a medium flow and angling it so the air current is directed slightly in front of your face. He says that by turning the gasper on, you might be able to add some turbulence to the air in your space. Modeling studies have shown, he says, that opening the gasper for additional air flow "does create some extra turbulence in your personal air space and that might create enough turbulence where the particle doesn't sort of land on your mask or on your arm." 
                Remarks by Sanofi CEO Paul Hudson provoked an uproar in France this week about access to a future COVID-19 vaccine.

             Remarks by Sanofi CEO Paul Hudson provoked an uproar in France this week about access to a future COVID-19 vaccine. With turf wars over face masks and other personal protective equipment not yet over, the battle over who will be the first to get a COVID-19 vaccine seems to have begun. Earlier this week, Paul Hudson, CEO of French pharmaceutical giant Sanofi, told Bloomberg News that if Sanofi develops a vaccine, doses would likely go to Americans first. Hudson said this was understandable, given the U.S. had financially supported its research. The comments outraged the French government and provoked an uproar in France. "For us, it would be unacceptable for there to be privileged access of any country based on financial reasons," French Deputy Finance Minister Agnès Pannier-Runacher told Radio Sud. President Emmanuel Macron was said to be shocked by the revelation from a company that is considered a champion of French industry and is given 150 million euros ($162 million) in tax exemptions every year. He will meet with the leaders of Sanofi at the Élysée Palace early next week. French Health Minister Olivier Véran told France's CNEWS television he was so disturbed he called Sanofi's French division CEO Olivier Bogillot, who he said reassured him about Hudson's comments. "I believe it was a phrase, as far as I can understand, that was a bit clumsy, and perhaps taken out of context, and I was quite reassured by the conversation I had with the head of Sanofi," said Véran. Bogillot was soon making the rounds to try to further justify and explain Hudson's comments. "You understand how shocking this is for us, to hear that one of our top companies would serve Americans first?" asked a commentator on BFMTV. Yes, said Bogillot, he absolutely did. He tried to explain that the U.S. was very organized and reacting quickly, "more quickly than Europe — with the money and the necessary regulatory structure," he said. "A vaccine usually takes 10 years and we're trying to do it in 18 or 24 months," he said. "That's something exceptional." Bogillot emphasized that Sanofi has huge vaccine production facilities in France and Europe and that Europeans would get a vaccine quickly. France, with nearly 177,000 confirmed cases and more than 27,000 deaths, is among Europe's hardest-hit countries, behind the U.K., Italy and Spain. Hudson's comments particularly shocked French people because Europe has pledged to fight COVID-19 together with other parts of the world. Earlier this month, the European Union organized a fundraising event at which countries and organizations around the world pledged $8 billion for coronavirus vaccines, diagnostics and therapeutics. The U.S. and Russia were notably absent. Macron has said vaccine availability should be for all and should not be influenced by the laws of the market. Stefan De Keersmaecker, a health policy spokesperson at the European Commission in Brussels, says a vaccine should be a global public good. "Its access needs to be equitable and universal," he said at a news conference. Talk of European solidarity is heartening, says Yannis Natsis, who is on the board of the European Medicines Agency, the equivalent of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. But the reality has been different, he notes, and he expects there will be fierce competition for access to a vaccine.  "The way there was fierce competition among EU member states when Italy started asking for protective equipment and got nothing," he says. "And the same way EU member states closed their borders and didn't exchange medical supplies. They practically said, 'Everyone for himself.' That's the sad reality." Natsis also says drugs are almost always released first in the U.S. "Why? Because there, they get the highest price," he says. "Because the U.S. doesn't have a health care system, it has a market. And the principle is the sky is the limit — as much as the market can bear." European nations offer universal coverage to their citizens, so they negotiate with drug companies for lower prices. That can translate into much lower prices for drugs in Europe.  But with the U.S. committing so much money to develop a vaccine, Natsis says it would not be surprising if it would be the first market served. Sanofi board president Serge Weinberg, appearing on the French nightly news, said the U.S. had contributed around $600 million for Sanofi's research.  In a tense interview, Weinberg said he understood why the French felt angry, but he didn't want there to be any ambiguity. He insisted that the French and other Europeans would get a vaccine at the same time as the Americans — made in Sanofi's European factories. Hudson's comments, he said, had been misconstrued. "We will collaborate and find solutions and make them accessible," he said. "Any vaccine will be a public good." Natsis says pharmaceutical companies, for the most part, are saying all the right things about accessibility and affordability — but he's not sure what that will mean when this is all over. In the aftermath of COVID-19, he says, European governments are going to be bankrupt and weakened and unable to take on big pharmaceutical companies. He calls the Sanofi incident a wake-up call for France. "Sanofi is not a French company," he says. "Even if it instills national pride in France, it stopped being a French company a long time ago. It's a multinational, and it's behaving like one."

             Undocumented workers are fighting for personal protection equipment as they perform work categorized as "essential" by the federal government. Occasionally, Alt.Latino looks beyond the world of music, though the intersection of the pandemic, politics and the arts is never far from mind. This week, we host a roundtable with reporters covering the coronavirus and how infections have adversely impacted communities of color in the U.S.  Dianne Solis is a Senior Writer for the Dallas Morning News who normally covers immigration for the paper. She tells us about the spread of the coronavirus in immigration detention centers in Texas. We're going to hear from my NPR colleague Marisa Peñaloza. She's been reporting on the plight of undocumented workers and their fight for personal protection equipment and economic aid when they can't do the work that has been categorized as "essential" by the federal government. When the pandemic started, many Latinos from the U.S. and Latin American countries were in Europe. For Palabra, a publication run by the National Association of Hispanic Journalists, Barbara Estrada spoke to the folks who chose to stay there and ride it out.   Dallas Morning News reporter Alfredo Corchado recently wrote an editorial for the New York Times op-ed section that called for changes to our immigration laws. These changes could have a positive impact on food chains and manufacturing supply routes, which could contribute to the economic recovery of not just the U.S. but the entire North American region.   This will not be the last time we change our focus from music to the pandemic and we hope you embrace this coverage as intimately as you do our musical offerings. Be careful out there, gente. — Felix Contreras Loading...  Updated at 6:58 a.m. ET Saturday Congress has authorized roughly $3 trillion in coronavirus relief in four separate measures over the last two months. These bills attempt to protect the American economy from long-term harm caused by stay-at-home orders and respond to the overall impact of the virus.  On Friday, the House approved a Democrats-only bill to spend another $3 trillion. Republicans have rejected the proposal, known as the HEROES Act, and are calling for a pause on new aid. But House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., says the latest legislation is her starting point for any new negotiations.  In several cases, Congress voted on the relief spending with little time to review the proposals and without an official cost estimate from the Congressional Budget Office. But now CBO has released estimates showing that the costs of some programs are expected to outpace early projections — driving up the total cost of the bills.  These long-term expenses will be added on top of recent projections from the CBO that the U.S. deficit would be more than $3.7 trillion in 2020. NPR reviewed data and estimates reported by the CBO to break down how Congress allocated money to respond to the pandemic. Those estimates, known as scores, detail how much the agency expects programs will cost and how those measures will impact the debt, deficit and government revenue.  In some cases, Congress approved a fixed amount of money for a program, like the Paycheck Protection Program loans for small businesses.  In other cases, like the expanded unemployment insurance and tax credits for emergency paid family and sick leave, Congress approved the credits and their values but did not put a cap on the expenditures. When that happens, the CBO estimates the number of people and companies that may take advantage of the program. The CBO often provides those estimates in two-year figures, in part because it may take time for businesses and individuals to file claims. Here's how the coronavirus relief money breaks down.  Loading...  The bulk of the support for individuals was approved in the second and third packages, known as the Families First Coronavirus Response Act and the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Stability Act, also known as CARES.  The biggest expenditures on individuals have been on cash relief payments, expansions to unemployment assistance, emergency family and medical leave. Cash relief payments: $293 billion (estimated) Many people have already started to receive direct deposits totaling as much as $1,200 under the program known as recovery rebates. Individuals earning less than $75,000 can expect a one-time cash payment of $1,200. Married couples would each receive a check and families would get $500 per child. That means a family of four earning less than $150,000 can expect $3,400. The checks start to phase down after that and disappear completely for people making more than $99,000 and couples making more than $198,000. The cash payments are based on most recent tax filings. People who receive Social Security payments, people experiencing homelessness and others who don't typically need to file tax return are still eligible, too.  Expanded unemployment insurance: $268 billion (estimated).  The third piece of legislation included temporary changes to federal unemployment benefits, including a supplemental benefit for all workers and new protections for gig workers.  Under the legislation, states will still pay base unemployment to people who qualify. That amount varies state by state, as does the amount of time people are allowed to claim it. Congress added $600 per week from the federal government on top of whatever base amount a worker receives from the state. That boosted payment will last through the end of July. For example, if an out-of-work person is receiving the national average of about $340 per week, under the new federal program their take-home pay will be $940. The legislation also adds 13 weeks of unemployment insurance. People nearing the maximum number of weeks allowed by their state would get an extension. New filers would also be allowed to collect the benefits for the longer period. The estimated cost also includes a new, temporary Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program through the end of this year to help people who lose work as a direct result of the public health emergency. The Congressional Budget Office made their predictions based on a model projecting an unemployment rate reaching 14% in the second quarter of this year and remaining at 10% at the end of 2021.  Administration officials have admitted in recent weeks that the rate could continue rise in the immediate term before recovering. The scorekeepers specifically noted that this is just a projection and the numbers could change, which would in turn change the overall cost of the changes to unemployment insurance.  Emergency family and medical leave: $105 billion (estimated).  The second bill congress approved included new tax credits for businesses to support emergency family and medical leave.  Under the bill, certain employers are required to give up to 80 hours of fully paid sick leave if the employee is unable to work because they are in quarantine and/or experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 and seeking medical care. Those employers would also have to approve up to 80 hours of partially paid leave for people caring for someone under the same conditions or to care for a child under 18 whose regular child care facility or school is closed.  The Congressional Budget Office projects that offering employers fully refundable credits against payroll taxes to compensate employees for the leave will cost the government about $105 billion. This cost is unlike a program where the federal government pays for the benefit directly. Instead, the cost is based on the expectation that the Treasury Department will lose revenues as a result of the policies.  Cost reductions for individuals on federal health insurance programs: $8.6 billion (estimated two-year cost) The second coronavirus relief bill eliminates any cost-sharing for people seeking testing and treatment for COVID-19 under Medicare, Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program, known as CHIP. This was intended to make it easier for low-income people to get tested.  Loading...  The total amount available to big businesses is well over $500 billion. The CARES Act includes a section described as Economic Stabilization and Assistance to Severely Distressed Sectors of the U.S. Economy. That is the long way of describing aid for big businesses. This includes emergency lending from the federal reserve, credit assistance to airlines and pandemic relief for airline workers.  Extra lending authority for the Federal Reserve: $454 billion (this money is expected to be fully recouped with fees and repayments) This portion of the bill has a big price tag up front, but the CBO estimates that the repayment, fees and other economic activity will make up for the initial spending. They do not consider it a true cost to the federal budget or the deficit. The chart includes the money because it is an approved expenditure, but it is considered in a separate category than the remaining spending. The Federal Reserve has also taken separate actions that don't involve Congress.  Airlines: $58 billion  This money is allocated to help airlines stay open. One portion of that money is set aside to help cover employee wages, salaries and benefits divided up as up to $25 billion for passenger air carriers, up to $4 billion for cargo air carriers, and up to $3 billion for airline contractors.  Loading...  There is more than $800 billion in small business aid spread across the four bills that have passed so far. The biggest portion of that sum is dedicated to the forgivable loans in the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). The first round of PPP — $349 billion — ran out in less than two weeks. Congress approved another $321 billion that is still being spent. Small businesses also have access to $21 billion in disaster grants plus some additional loan subsidies. There's also a tax credit for keeping employees on payroll that is estimated to cost about $52 billion.  Loading...  Some elements of the CARES act support a wide range of businesses without the size limitations included in the PPP. The legislation establishes a fully refundable tax credit for businesses of all sizes that are closed or distressed to help them keep workers on the payroll. The credit is expected to cost about $52 billion.  The goal is to help businesses re-hire employees that have already been laid off or furloughed. The credit covers to 50% of payroll on the first $10,000 of compensation, including health benefits, for each employee. For employers with more than 100 full-time employees, the credit is for wages paid to employees when they are not providing services because of the coronavirus. Eligible employers with 100 or fewer full-time employees could use the deduction even if they aren't closed. Other broader business supports include a delay in when payroll taxes are due, which the CBO estimates will cost $352 billion up front but will be largely repaid years in the future. There are also tax changes increasing the cap on net operating losses and changing the rules for interest deductibility.   Loading...  All four bills include money to help support hospitals and public health systems. The most expensive items include funding for research and development, direct aid to hospitals and care centers, and money to offset more of the cost of treating Medicare patients.  The first bill focused primarily on public health and global health. It was passed in the weeks before it was clear how deeply the coronavirus would affect the U.S. It included $3.1 billion for vaccine and treatment research, $3.2 billion for Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and $1.2 billion for the State Department to carry out global health programs.  The CARES Act provided $1.32 billion for community health centers that provide health care for roughly 28 million people. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention got another $4.3 billion from CARES and the Strategic National Stockpile received $16 billion.  Loading...  Congress has set aside roughly $28 billion to help pay for testing and access to testing. Other spending areas, including funding for the CDC, Food and Drug Administration, and National Institutes of Health have been used to boost testing capacity and speed up the process of approvals.  Loading...  States and local governments have access to funds in a number of programs, particularly public health funding and money for publicly run hospitals and community health centers.  The Families First Coronavirus Response bill included $1 billion for state and local administrative costs, and CARES included $150 billion in direct aid to states for the coronavirus response.   Loading...  There is long list of miscellaneous programs including those that shore up social safety net programs but do not pay money directly to individuals. In many cases, the funding helps support existing federal programs that have been stretched during the coronavirus response. Child nutrition: There is $8.8 billion in the CARES Act to give schools more flexibility to provide meals for students. Food stamps: CARES also included $15.5 billion for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as SNAP. The money will help cover the expected cost of new applications to the program as a result of the coronavirus. That bill also included $450 million more for food banks and other community food distribution programs. Government administration: CARES included $10 billion in lending for the Postal Service, the Families First Coronavirus bill gave the IRS $15 million to implement programs – the filing date was extended to July 15.

             A nurse at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Manhattan holds a cellphone last month so a COVID-19 patient can see and listen to his family. COVID-19 has given ventilators an undeservedly bad reputation, says Dr. Colin Cooke, an associate professor of medicine in the division of pulmonary and critical care at the University of Michigan. "It's always disheartening to know that some people are out there saying if you end up on a ventilator it's a death sentence, which is not what we are experiencing — and I don't think it's what the data are showing," Cooke says. Early reports from China, the United Kingdom and Seattle found mortality rates as high as 90% among patients on ventilators. And more recently, a study of some New York hospitals seemed to show a mortality rate of 88%. But Cooke and others say the New York figure was misleading because the analysis included only patients who had either died or been discharged. "So folks who were actually in the midst of fighting their illness were not being included in the statistic of patients who were still alive," he says. Those patients made up more than half of all the people in the study.  And Cooke suspects that many of them will survive. "We think that mortality for folks that end up on the ventilator with [COVID-19] is going to end up being somewhere between probably 25% up to maybe 50%," Cooke says. Scary, but hardly a death sentence. There's also some encouraging news from a New York health system that cares for people with risk factors that make them much more likely to die from COVID-19 Montefiore Health System in the Bronx serves a low-income population with high rates of diabetes, obesity and other health problems. And in April, it faced an onslaught of sick people with COVID-19. "The number of patients with critical care needs was more than triple the normal levels," says Dr. Michelle Ng Gong, chief of critical care medicine at Montefiore and a professor at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. To cope, regular hospital wards became intensive care units, critical care teams worked extra shifts, and heart doctors found themselves caring for lung patients. Weeks later, it's still too soon to calculate mortality rates precisely, Gong says.  "We still have a large number of patients on mechanical ventilation in our intensive care unit," she says. "So the outcomes of those patients is still uncertain." But Gong adds that when it comes to COVID-19 patients on ventilators, "We win more than we lose."  That's especially good news coming from a city where hospitals faced so many challenges, says Dr. Todd Rice, who directs the medical intensive care unit at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tenn. "They were having to care for patients in makeshift ICUs [with] doctors who weren't their normal ICU doctors," Rice says. "That probably results in some worse outcomes." So far, Vanderbilt has been able to keep COVID-19 patients on ventilators in existing ICUs with experienced intensive care teams, Rice says. And the mortality rate "is in the mid-to-high 20% range," he says. That's only a bit higher than the death rate for patients placed on ventilators with severe lung infections unrelated to the coronavirus.  And, like many other intensive care specialists, Rice says he thinks COVID-19 will turn out to be less deadly than the early numbers suggested. "I think overall these mortality rates are going to be higher than we're used to seeing but not dramatically higher," he says. Preliminary data from Emory University in Atlanta support that prediction. The mortality rate among 165 COVID-19 patients placed on a ventilator at Emory was just under 30%. And unlike the New York study, only a few patients were still on a ventilator when the data were collected. Factors that may have kept death rates low include careful planning and no shortages of equipment or personnel, says Dr. Craig Coopersmith, who directs the critical care center at Emory. But the care largely followed existing protocols for patients with life-threatening lung infections, he says. "There is no secret magic that can't be replicated in other places," Coopersmith says. "And I do believe that we will see a global trend toward better outcomes on the ventilator and in the intensive care unit." Also, intensive care doctors say ICU teams are becoming more skilled at treating COVID-19 patients as they gain experience with the disease. For example, they are doing more to prevent dangerous blood clots from forming. That means COVID-19 mortality rates in ICUs are likely to decrease over time, Coopersmith says. "It's still going to be a devastating disease," he says, "but a more manageable devastating disease."

             A nurse and National Guard medic interview a patient before taking a swab for a coronavirus test last month at Gallatin High School in Gallatin, Tenn. The state of Tennessee started picking up the tab for testing in April. To reopen businesses and public spaces safely, experts say states need to be testing and contact tracing on a massive scale. But only a handful of states are doing enough testing to stay on top of potential outbreaks, according to a state-by-state analysis published by NPR.  Among those, Tennessee stands out for its aggressive approach to testing. In Tennessee, anyone who wants a test can get one, and the state will pick up the tab. The guidance has evolved to "when in doubt, get a test," and the state started picking up the tab in April. It's still rare for a community to encourage such broad symptom-free testing.  "In most places, you still need to show you have the signs and symptoms of COVID-19 to get a test," research professor Sabrina Corlette of Georgetown University says. "It's really patchwork."  Ample testing, preferably including people who are not symptomatic, can help contain future outbreaks of COVID-19 by giving health officials the knowledge to act quickly to suppress any new cluster of cases.  Because of testing shortages, many states still have limitations on who can get a test. Some states such as Alabama are inviting people without symptoms but only if they qualify as high risk. A few counties in Nevada have started asymptomatic testing, and Rite Aid in a dozen states has opened up its walk-in testing, but it's still for folks who preregister. Tennessee's commitment to testing so broadly has helped it pull ahead of most other states in its rate of testing. According to NPR's analysis, Tennessee is doing more than double the minimum number of tests needed to control its outbreak.  Tennessee Department of Health Commissioner Lisa Piercey gives a lot of credit for the state's increased testing to private, commercial labs. "We've called on almost all of them to say, 'We need you to ramp up because you're about to get a flood of tests,' and that's exactly what we've given them," Piercey said at a daily briefing in late April. In one weekend, it was more than 11,000 tests. But private labs are shouldering the testing load in most states. What's somewhat novel in Tennessee is that the state guaranteed payment to those companies upfront. So rather than making them bill various health insurance plans — which are required to cover coronavirus testing but still create paperwork — the state is picking up the tab. And the typical rate set by the federal government just doubled to $100 a swab.  Memphis-based American Esoteric Laboratories has been processing the bulk of the state-collected swabs. The company declined to comment for this story. Nashville-based Aegis Sciences Corp. jumped in more recently and is already doubling its capacity to 7,000 tests a day. CEO Frank Basile says the guaranteed payment was a big motivator. "Clearly, it's beneficial for the lab companies like us to receive the assurance of payment," Basile says. "That's definitely a positive. And it gives us the confidence to put the effort and the capital in to make this happen." And coronavirus testing requires more investment right now because the swabs and chemicals necessary to do it are in such high demand. The tax dollars are well-spent, says Dr. Ashish Jha, faculty director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, which has been tracking testing capacity by state. He says Tennessee's investment could more than pay for itself since ample capacity is seen as a necessity to reopen businesses. Jha says he's been recommending this approach to government officials across the country. "If the state says they'll just pay everybody 100 bucks every time you do a test, that strikes me as very smart policy," he says. Tennessee officials said they're banking on being reimbursed by the federal government at some point. The Tennessee Department of Health doesn't know exactly how much it's on the hook for yet. But it's a tab that grows by millions of dollars a week. Aside from weekend drive-through events, the state is also paying to process the weekday testing being done by local health departments in 95 counties. On a recent Sunday more than 800 people were tested at one site in Hendersonville, Tenn. Christine Garner was willing to wait in her minivan as she slowly moved through the parking lot of a local high school. "I said, 'I know there will be a long line, but we'll just sit and wait.' We charged our tablets, and I'm doing sight words with the kids," she says.  Garner closes refinanced mortgages for a living, which puts her in close contact with multiple families a day — often in their homes. Still, she had no symptoms. And her closest contact to someone with COVID-19 was secondhand. "I'm just hypersensitive to any change in my body at all. I think a lot of people are," she says.  All this testing access is generally a good thing, says Dr. Kelly Moore, a pandemic consultant, formerly of the Tennessee Department of Health. She refers to the test takers as primarily "the worried well" since nearly 99% of them have tested negative at some testing events. "If these highly motivated, worried well people, coming out for free tests, are not taking up scarce resources we need for someone else, then it's definitely not a problem to test them," Moore says. But there's a potential downside. All those negative test results improve a state's closely watched positivity rate — that is the percentage of cases coming back positive. A low rate of positives is seen as a sign that a community is doing enough testing. But it's possible to be missing pockets of infection among people who might not have the awareness or resources to get tested.  "We can't draw conclusions about what's going on in the whole community based on this self-selected group of people who are so motivated they come out to get tested," Moore says. But recently, Tennessee started using its testing muscle in a more targeted way and is also testing everyone who lives or works in nursing homes and prisons. And on May 7, the state said the National Guard would start testing everyone who lives in public housing.

             Sam Sterling skis over a crusty layer of snow in the mountains off the Denali Highway in Interior Alaska this month. After a spring of grim coronavirus headlines, Alaska faces a near-apocalyptic outlook for its summer tourist season, with few out-of-state visitors likely to follow through on plans to travel to the state this year. But for a moment at Denali National Park and Preserve earlier this month, a handful of tailgaters contemplated a few possible upsides: Resident discounts. Busy fishing holes transformed into blissful calm. RV-clogged roads emptied of traffic. Cruise destinations with no ships in sight. "Think of how much fun Talkeetna is going to be when there aren't hordes of people in the middle of the street!" said Rebecca Pottebaum, referring to the touristy town just south of Denali. "That's why we're going to go to Juneau!" said her friend Julie Sweetin. "Juneau's epic without cruise ships." The COVID-19 pandemic has all but vaporized Alaska's tourism industry this year, with social distancing measures and quarantines effectively eliminating the normal summer deluge of out-of-state visitors. And questions linger about how comfortable people already in Alaska will feel about stepping aboard a chartered fishing boat or a park shuttle bus. But some residents, businesses and land managers still see a possible silver lining in the devastation: A spring and summer in a world-class tourist destination — without the tourists. On May 9, Pottebaum, Sweetin and a few of their friends got a preview of options that could be open to them over the rest of the summer, when they parked at a gate 30 miles along the Denali Park Road, and rode their bicycles deeper inside. "One thing great about here in Alaska is we have these wide open spaces where you can be with your family or a single household, and then also social distance when you need to," said Sarah Leonard, chief executive of the Alaska Travel Industry Association, the state's leading tourism advocacy group. "This is a great time — if you can do it safely and you're right here in Alaska — to visit a place that you might not have visited before." ATIA last month sent Gov. Mike Dunleavy a request for $25 million in federal COVID-19 relief, which it would put toward a national campaign to market Alaska "as a safe destination, when travel restrictions loosen." But before that happens, the group also wants an extra $1 million for an in-state campaign. The idea is to remind Alaskans that they can take staycations this summer, as most out-of-state visitors remain at home. There's pent-up demand from Alaskans for the kinds of experiences that tourism businesses want to sell this summer, and the industry could use the boost, says former U.S. Sen. Mark Begich, who now co-chairs the governor's economic recovery team.  "We've been kind of cooped up for a little long here, right?" he said. "There's going to be Alaskans who will want to take that road trip that they haven't been able to do in years because they never could get a reservation, or they couldn't get access, or the tour was sold out." Some tourism businesses are already trying to pivot to Alaska residents. On the Kenai Peninsula, Alaskan Fishing Adventures is offering 50% off "locals' specials" trips, starting later this month. The company, which runs boats out of Seward and Homer, usually offers similar discounts this time of year, said owner Mark Burner. But because of social distancing mandates, he'll put fewer people on this spring's charter trips and run the boats farther out from the harbor, likely making for better fishing. "We're not going to fish close. We're actually going to take them out fishing and treat it as if it were a fully-paid charter," Burner said. "It's a hell of a deal." Charter operators have also formally asked federal fisheries managers to loosen restrictions on the size and number of halibut that customers can catch, saying the move would grant Alaskans and other fishermen already in the state "an opportunity to bring halibut home in these challenging times." In Denali, meanwhile, the National Park Service is still developing its plans for socially distant summer recreation opportunities. The area typically sees heavy traffic from cruise ship passengers, and as many as 90 buses can drive the restricted 92-mile road into the park each summer day. But nearly all of Alaska's cruise season has been canceled.

             Sverre LeRoy rides toward the Polychrome Overlook on the road that leads 90 miles into Denali National Park earlier this month. The park service still hopes to run a limited bus service into Denali, with fewer people and safeguards like plexiglass shields and masks, said Denice Swanke, the park's acting superintendent. It's getting ready to unveil a separate, new program for businesses to offer smaller-scale tours, like with a guide and a single family driving the park road in separate cars. And with fewer tour buses on the road, the park service is also planning to allow more access for private vehicles. During the summer, cars are normally blocked from continuing past Savage River, 15 miles along the route; this year, the park service is likely to grant access to private vehicles, through a reservation system, every other weekend, Swanke said. "It's going to be a good summer," she said in a phone interview. "It's just going to be a different summer." While business from Alaskans could soften the pandemic's punch, it won't be a panacea: The state's entire population of 730,000 represents just half of the 1.4 million cruise ship passengers expected this summer before the coronavirus outbreak. Plus, with tens of thousands of Alaskans out of work, tourism businesses aren't expecting residents to have abundant disposable income. "If they don't open the restrictions, the locals aren't going to have any money anyways," said Burner, the charter operator. Burner said one reason he's able to offer his discounted early-season trips is because his business received Paycheck Protection Program aid from the federal government. Unless that continues, "the price is going to have to go up," and he'll likely have to pull all but maybe one of his six boats out of the water. Burner said he'll have ample hand sanitizer and require customers to wear masks, and people will likely have to have their temperature taken as they enter his business' lodges. But those types of steps still may not be enough to convince Alaskans to leave the isolation of their family units. Back at Denali, Pottebaum, one of the tailgaters, considered the risks that would come with a chartered fishing trip. "I trust my friends — we could go as a household. But the captains are potentially exposed to different groups all the time," she said. "And if they're not taking two weeks between every trip, is it worth the risk?"

             Then-Vice President Joe Biden stands onstage during the Democratic National Convention on July 27, 2016, in Philadelphia. Four years ago, Joe Biden took the stage at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia to the Rocky theme, looking out over a crowd of delegates waving red and white signs that bore his name. He encouraged fellow Democrats to unite and rally around Hillary Clinton. Now, as Democrats plan to hold the convention that will nominate Biden, the chances that he'll bask in the same kind of scene this year seem ever more distant, as the Democratic Party faces the possibility of a limited in-person presence or virtual gathering. The challenge is not unique to Democrats or to politics, as events across the U.S. have been scrapped or dramatically curtailed because of the coronavirus pandemic. Joe Solmonese, the chief executive of the Democratic National Convention, said in an interview on Thursday that organizers of the event, scheduled to take place in Milwaukee this August, were being guided by both public health "and the idea of what it is that this convention is intended to do." "How many people we do that in front of, how many hotel rooms we occupy in the city of Milwaukee, how many buses and what sort of security infrastructure we end up having in terms of the uncertainty of the public health environment remains to be seen." This week, the Democratic Party's rules and bylaws committee adopted changes to allow delegates to participate in the party's convention even if they are unable to attend in person. This comes after Democrats delayed the convention, which had originally been planned for July but was moved back about a month out of concern for public health and in the hopes that restrictions would ease by then. Democrats have made no final decisions about what their convention could look like, and Solmonese said it's too soon to say. But Democrats have been openly discussing alternative formats, should public health mandates make a traditional gathering unrealistic. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., suggested last week in an interview with C-SPAN that Democratic National Committee Chair Tom Perez should "get a gigantic stadium and put people 6 feet apart" and reduce the convention from a multiday affair to a single day. In a Politico interview, Democratic strategist Lis Smith, who advised Pete Buttigieg's presidential campaign, alluded to the virtual event that Travis Scott held via the widely popular online game Fortnite as a source of inspiration. Even Biden himself has suggested that the convention to nominate him may happen digitally. Solmonese said that even before the pandemic forced more contingency planning, his team of organizers had been thinking of ways to innovate so that the convention could keep pace with how the rules of politics are changing. "Conventions have historically been a convening of party activists doing the work of a party in a very traditional way to put forward their nominee and then filming that and broadcasting that to the American people," he said. This year, he added, Democrats have an opportunity to "be much more intentional about the platforms that we deliver that message onto and the states and the people that are most important to get that information." Ultimately, party conventions aren't just about nominating a candidate. They're also a platform to promote the party's message and values, as well as to organize ahead of the November election. Leah Daughtry served as the CEO of the Democratic National Convention in 2008 and again in 2016. She says the success of the event doesn't hinge on having a live audience in an arena. "What it does mean is we must make a compelling visual narrative that people can see in, be engaged in, sucked into with the right entertainers, that will make me come to the television night after night," she said. Emmy Ruiz, a Democratic strategist who worked on Kamala Harris' presidential campaign, said that changes to the convention's format could also mean new opportunities for Democrats when it comes to organizing. "Being able to do it from my home and having a real, active role of participation that is meeting people where they're at literally — I think is a strength," she said. The changes to party conventions are not just happening on a national level. State parties are also being forced to innovate. In Texas, Democrats scrapped their in-person gathering and are moving online instead. "Our in-person convention previously varied between 10,000 and 15,000 people showing up, and we're hoping to see all of those numbers grow as we're able to stream all of this content online, especially those more intimate, constituency-based programming that we hadn't been able to put online before," said Brittany Switzer, the Texas Democratic Party's brand director. Texas Democrats are planning a two-pronged virtual convention in June. One channel will focus on official party business, such as voting on delegates. A second track will include speakers, performances and panels, the first of which were announced this week. "We're not sacrificing anything in terms of support and training and community building. All of those elements are going to still very much be present," Hannah Roe Beck, the Texas Democrats' convention director, said. This isn't just an issue impacting Democrats. For their part, Republicans have publicly said they are pushing ahead with plans for an in-person convention in Charlotte, N.C., this summer. Lara Trump, President Trump's daughter-in-law and a top campaign surrogate, said this week that Republicans had no plans to cancel their convention. "It is in August in Charlotte, N.C. We're very excited to see that happen and to hopefully be back to some semblance of normalcy then," she said. While Republicans have made no public moves to change their convention, the Republican National Convention planners recently added a senior adviser focused on health and safety planning.

             London's Heathrow Airport is one of the few in the world continuing to allow unrestricted international arrivals. The British government says it will soon require travelers to quarantine for 14 days. If you want to visit the Great Pyramids or the Great Wall or the Taj Mahal, forget it. Egypt, China and India are just a few of the dozens of countries that have imposed strict travel restrictions to keep visitors, and the coronavirus, out. An analysis by NPR based on data from the International Air Transport Association found that more than three-quarters of the world's nations and territories have suspended travel from at least one other place.  Loading...  Restrictions are often promoted by politicians as a sign of strength in efforts to halt the spread of the new coronavirus. But experts say the border closures have done little to stop it. And going forward, they say, travel restrictions will play only a small role in containing the virus. "I think they're mostly useless, to tell you the truth," says Ira Longini, a professor of biostatistics at the University of Florida who has studied the effects of restrictions. Far more important, Longini says, are domestic systems for testing and contact tracing. "You have to have the internal control strategy — that's effective," he says. Travel restrictions have been with humanity for a long time. As early as the 14th century, European kingdoms would quarantine ships to try and prevent the spread of plague, according to Benjamin Mason Meier, a professor of global health policy at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The quarantines didn't always work, he says. "At the same time, it was limiting the flow of traffic that was so crucial to the livelihoods of people around the world." In the 1800s, nations started trying to develop standardized rules around travel and disease. A series of international sanitary conventions followed in the 20th century that became the basis of the International Health Regulations, a set of rules laid down by the World Health Organization and agreed to by nations. "The purpose is to prevent disease but to do so in a way that provides the least restriction on international traffic and commerce," Meier says. The latest revision of the regulations was published in 2005, a few years after the first SARS outbreak. The rules state that "measures shall not be more restrictive of international traffic and not more invasive or intrusive to persons than reasonably available alternatives that would achieve the appropriate level of health protection." Nations are supposed to provide WHO with a rationale for any ban. But all that seems to have gone out the window with this pandemic. "I think it is kind of an intuitive human reaction to sort of pull up the drawbridge," says Tara O'Toole, an executive at the investment firm In-Q-Tel and a former top scientific official at the Department of Homeland Security. O'Toole says most research on the current pandemic shows that at best travel restrictions brought just a few days of extra time to prepare. That's because sick travelers always travel faster than governments can impose bans. "Particularly in modern times, when we travel from one end of the globe to the other in 24 hours, the horse is already out of the barn," O'Toole says. Nevertheless, she says, she thinks initially the restrictions probably made sense, given the scale of the coronavirus crisis. Nations needed every advantage they could get. WHO initially advised against travel and trade restrictions, but it has since softened its stance, at least somewhat. "WHO will update recommendations on appropriate travel measures and analyze their effects on international transmission of COVID-19," a statement supplied to NPR reads in part. Even though the coronavirus has spread basically everywhere, it may make sense for some nations to keep their restrictions in place, according to Marc Lipsitch, an epidemiologist at Harvard University. That's because right now, the only way to suppress the coronavirus is through finding the sick and tracking down their contacts before they can sicken others. "The last thing you want is a bunch of cases coming in that you can't anticipate because they're not linked to any local contacts," Lipsitch says. He says he thinks travel restrictions may be helpful, particularly for countries that are small and can easily control their borders such as islands. "It might be better to harm the tourism industry than to go back into a long period of generalized economic disruption from social distancing," he says. But the United States, which is currently restricting travel from Europe, China and Iran, is a different case. At the moment, the U.S. is a major hot spot for coronavirus infections and has little to lose by letting others in. But even in the long term, restrictions don't make much sense, says Nathan Grubaugh, an epidemiologist at Yale University. "For the U.S. to say that we can eliminate all virus in the country and then shut down all the borders so that no virus comes in would be completely off base," Grubaugh says. Domestic travelers from local hot spots will require other regions to keep watch for new infections for a long time to come. "There's so many pockets where virus can be found." However, Grubaugh says there is another problem with reopening air travel: "The airports and flights themselves are a big risk factor," he says. Long international flights, with lots of passengers crammed together, are ideal places for the virus to spread, he warns. How long travel restrictions will stay in place remains far from clear. Grubaugh says he thinks economic pressures will soon cause them to be lifted. But Meier says he worries that in the current era of nationalism and xenophobia, the restrictions could stick around. "They divide the world at the moment that global solidarity is most crucial to facing this common threat," he says. O'Toole says she believes in the end, it may be testing that reopens the world to travel. "Hopefully we will get to the point where we can test people before they get on planes," she says. "So that you have a good amount of assurance that none of your fellow passengers are transmitting virus."

             Members of the House stand after they passed the $2 trillion-plus coronavirus stimulus package in March at the Capitol. Texas Democratic Rep. Joaquin Castro is not on board with how his Republican governor has let the Lone Star State reopen in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic. Gov. Greg Abbott let Texas' stay-at-home orders expire last month, and businesses resumed their operations with limited capacity. With the state's caseload on the rise, Castro said it's all happening too soon. "There is more testing in Texas now than there was in the beginning, but not nearly enough, or to scale that you would need to able to say, 'OK we're testing enough people and our curve is where we would need it to be,' " Castro says. So Castro is moving on to warning constituents of the risks, and his office has ramped up services to connect those in need with unemployment payments and food assistance. And when it's possible, his staff is connecting them with testing. Many Republicans are taking a controversial stance by reopening without sufficient testing in place and are blaming Democrats for the country's current economic woes. "The people want to go back, the numbers are getting to a point where they can, and there just seems to be no effort on certain blue states to get back into gear," President Trump recently told reporters in the Rose Garden. It's a reminder of the country's partisan divide that's on full display in the debate over when and how to return to normal business. "I think what we are seeing now is lawmakers and governors and all sorts of stakeholders having to balance economic pressures with public health pressures," said Caitlin Rivers, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. "It's a difficult thing to anticipate. We see a lot of stress from people who are anxious to get back to work, understandably, and also people who are anxious at the idea of spending more time in the community while there is a still an epidemic under way." Lawmakers are weighing the coronavirus risks firsthand. This month, the Republican-led Senate and Democratic-led House returned to Capitol Hill after several weeks away. The House returned Friday solely to vote on two measures: a new wave of coronavirus relief and a rules change to allow remote voting and hearings during the pandemic. Republicans are opposed to both moves and have criticized Democrats for their delays in reconvening. The partisan divide resonates in the reopening debate for the country and for Congress, says Dr. David Relman, a professor of microbiology and immunology at Stanford University. And it could come down to an urban versus rural debate. "I think the two parties have dug themselves in a little bit. Perhaps the Democrats are a little bit stronger on supporting the public health mission," Relman said. "The Republicans are focusing upon the economic impact of the pandemic and ... perhaps coming from parts of the country where population density is less, disease activity maybe a little less obvious." Coronavirus risks on Capitol Hill Days after the Senate returned for the first time since late March, a staff member for Sen. Lamar Alexander tested positive for COVID-19. And Alexander, R-Tenn., was forced to quarantine just ahead of a high-profile hearing for the Senate health committee featuring several administration witnesses also in quarantine. It highlighted risks facing Congress without a widespread testing program in place. "Folks like these need ongoing virus testing, and by testing everyone at least twice a week, you can catch a new infection before too many days of contagiousness pass undetected," said Relman, who is also chief of infectious diseases at the Veterans Affairs Palo Alto Health Care System in California. Earlier this month, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, passed on an offer from the administration to accept 1,000 rapid tests for Congress. The move was met with mixed reviews by members of both sides of the aisle. "To feel like there was some special testing going on, I don't think that sat right with me, and I don't think that sat right with leadership," said Rep. Mikie Sherrill, D-N.J., who is currently working on a regional task force focused on reopening efforts. Sherrill's colleague on the bipartisan task force, New York Republican Rep. Pete King, agrees. But he also wonders whether at least Capitol Hill workers should get regular testing. "Thousands of workers have to come to the Capitol and then also you have, Washington, D.C., right now has a very high infection rate," King said. "The government has to function, but we run the risk of spreading the risk all over the country, so it becomes counterproductive. " So far, eight members of Congress have tested positive for the illness, and more than two dozen others have quarantined. And reports for the Capitol complex don't stop there, with more than 50 cases reported among its workforce by late last week. Fifteen Capitol Police officers have tested positive for COVID-19, according to a congressional aide. And among a construction crew working on renovations of the Cannon House Office Building, 22 workers have tested or are presumed to have caught the illness, the aide said. Ten people with the Architect of the Capitol, the umbrella group for workers in maintenance, food service and other support role, have been affected. And at least four members of Congress, including Alexander, have reported that staff members have tested positive. Relman says that ideally, everyone working in the Capitol building should be tested daily, but twice weekly testing is a compromise as a result of shortages. And that needs to include everyone, from members to support workers. "They, too. deserve exactly the same plan," he said. As a result, he says, the 1,000 test offer from the administration is a drop in the bucket, and only gives the superficial appearance of doing the right thing. A rare bipartisan effort Last month, Sherrill reached out to King to form the bipartisan task force to develop legislation to guide the safe reopening of the Northeast region. In the past several weeks, the task force has consulted with doctors and other experts to track down gaps in current efforts to reopen their economies. "Despite different political backgrounds and even despite different economic areas that we all serve in, so many of the issues can be handled if we start to talk together and come up with solutions," Sherrill said of their work. The members have found a common theme to address: testing shortages. And a critical need to boost federal leadership when it comes to that testing. King notes there hasn't been this level of coordination in the past, and that needs to change. "We realize now we have to, there has to be national testing standards, ... it has to be a federal coordination of this," King said. Sherrill notes that while national testing levels have increased capacity since March, the tests remain individualized to the company that manufactures them and that is a hindrance. For example, each company's tests may have unique components, such as reagent formulas and swabs, that could be standardized and substituted with generics, which could help boost capacity dramatically. King and Sherrill argue legislation installing new standards for testing components could be a key to reopening the economy. And now the group is weighing plans to roll out such a proposal. "You really need ... some government promulgating, some standards, some regulations to say, 'let's make this more generic,'" Sherill said. "That could get us to the testing capacity we need. So we're already looking at that and some fixes to make sure we have all the resources our region needs to safely get everyone back to work and not face another outbreak."

             Short Wave Logo We know it now as the 1918 influenza pandemic, and its tremors were felt far and wide. By the end of its spread, tens of millions were dead.  The field of public health has taken a giant leap from the days of 1918, when virology was still in its infancy. Today, information is instantaneous and vaccines are in widespread use.  And yet we find ourselves in an oddly similar moment in which experts are recommending many of the same, old-fashioned measures enacted to stem the 1918 epidemic.  NPR's Short Wave podcast sat down with medical historian Dr. Howard Markel, director of the Center for the History of Medicine at the University of Michigan, to hear what the world of 1918 can teach us in 2020. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. What has the world been like for you these days? What has it been like to live through this pandemic? It's been amazingly busy. When you're a historian of quarantine and epidemics and a worldwide pandemic occurs, it's sort of like ... being an accountant during tax season. And it's been especially busy because our center did a great deal of work with the CDC on these issues of social distancing and flattening the curve by looking at examples in the past where social distancing measures helped to save lives. ... But I was much more comfortable thinking about them in my head than seeing them enacted around the country [and] around the world!  It's like you're finally living what you've been researching for years.  Even when you're thinking about worst-case scenarios — like the most terrible pandemic ever — you're thinking about it [and] you're planning for it, but you're not living it. Seeing all of my work come to fruition is really gratifying, because ... I know it is helping to reduce the death rate, but it's also horrifying, because it means that there is a worst-case scenario pandemic going on. One of the things that we want to talk to you about today is the 1918 influenza outbreak as the biggest pandemic in history. What was that period like? It is helpful to look back at [1918] because, as you say, it was the worst pandemic in [recent] human history. ... Even though it was the 20th century, there was very little that doctors could do for their patients in terms of interventions. There were no medicines that really helped influenza patients. There were no IV fluids. There were no respirators. There were no vaccines.  On the one hand, we've come such a long way in terms of modern medicine, but on the other hand, we didn't have a vaccine then and we don't have a vaccine now.  In a way, we're kind of pulled back to the 1918 era, because not only do we not have any vaccines, we [also] don't have any effective antivirals that could treat people who get sick. On the other hand, we have intensive care units with ventilators and all sorts of machines that could measure oxygen content in blood, and all sorts of other things that allow for the care of the very, very acutely ill. ... But there are similarities in that we just don't know what to do right now.  What we are doing are really old-fashioned public health measures. We're actually hiding from the virus by doing these social distancing measures, hoping to buy time to a point where a vaccine may be ready. How does it feel to see these kinds of old-fashioned measures being practiced today? What's terrific about it, at least where I live, is how well people are adapting. And, you know, when we were proposing these measures about 15 years ago, there were a great many critics. People said, you know, life will end as we know it. [These measures] will destroy the universe .... Of course, it's not destroying the country. And even though the economy has been very heavily disrupted, I don't deny that, I'm positive that we'll get back to life after this dies down. Societies have dealt with terrible pandemics almost since there's been human beings, so history is on the side of resilience and coming back. One thing that your research has really focused on when it's come to 1918 is that the cities that really embraced social distancing came out stronger. Is there a lesson to be learned from that at the moment we're in right now?  There's two lessons.  One, "early, layered and long" works. It's not just 1918. We saw it in Mexico in 2009 [during the swine flu outbreak], and we've seen it elsewhere in experimental or modeling studies. We are certainly seeing it today in many countries and locally in many states.  The second lesson is that in 23 of the 43 [U.S.] cities we studied, [people in 1918] got restless after a while. They wanted the social distancing measures released; they wanted to go back to their normal lives. If you looked at the epidemic curve, it looked as if the cases and deaths were falling.  But if they weren't falling enough — if they weren't low enough — and then you open things up, the virus was still circulating and you got a second hump to [the epidemic] curve and another upward tick in cases and deaths, sometimes worse than the initial hump of their epidemic curve.  So what you're saying is that the shape of the curve can really follow the behavior of individuals.  Epidemics are living social laboratories. They involve many, many actors, not least of which is the microbe in question. Different microbes do affect people in different ways. They like different types of weather conditions. Different people behave differently before an epidemic, than during an epidemic, [and] in the middle of it, when they're tired of it. And this is why I'm a little bit skeptical of many mathematical models of epidemics, although they are helpful as one piece of data, but not the entire story.  And in that way, we're almost in uncharted waters, unexplored territory, even using 1918 as a benchmark.  1918 is so vastly different.  We're using it as a benchmark because ... it's what the worst-case scenario [is] and we have a lot of data on it. But the country is different [now]. Our transportation is vastly different. We have connectivity in a way that people couldn't even dream about in the form not only of telephones and smartphones, but the Internet. We have social media so people could tell their stories in ways that they could never communicate back in 1918. But we also have a leadership situation that has never been seen before.  So, yeah, historians are going to be busy on this one for a long time to come. Follow Emily on Twitter. Email the show at shortwave@npr.org.

             Tents line a gravel sidewalk off Fulton Street near City Hall in San Francisco on May 5. Last week, city staffers started using chalk to draw socially distant spaces along the street for the tents to stay in. San Francisco is set to enact a homelessness solution that it once thought unthinkable: city-sanctioned open-air encampments. For years, San Francisco police have ordered tents removed from city streets, even at times slashing them with knives themselves. Public Works employees have tossed the ever-ubiquitous nylon homes of desperate people into dump trucks on a weekly basis. Last week, San Francisco launched the first of five planned "Safe Sleeping Sites," with the hope that unhoused people would be kept socially distant amid the COVID-19 pandemic in a controlled location, replete with services such as showers and food. Tents, once an ultimate bogeyman of San Francisco's government, will be revered as lifesaving. The first location was announced May 6 by Mayor London Breed: an encampment of roughly 90 tents piled nearly on top of each other near the Asian Art Museum — on City Hall's front doorstep — was officially sanctioned and allowed to expand onto Fulton Street, between the museum and the Main Library. Safe, healthy, social distance may finally come to Civic Center's homeless. The second city-sanctioned safe sleeping site is already under operation at MLK Park by a local nonprofit, Mother Brown's Dining Room in the city's Bayview neighborhood. It started as a rogue operation, but after getting the official OK from San Francisco City Hall last week, services, showers and other resources were expected to blow in like a breeze under the sails of that existing effort, Gwendolyn Westbrook, Mother Brown's executive director said. All of the city-sanctioned sleeping sites were expected to receive those wraparound services. "I went into the park and set up the tents," said Westbrook, who had help from Bayview advocates Gloria Berry and Michelle Pierce. "The city left us alone, and now, as a matter of fact, they're going to help us a lot." Three other sites are now under various phases of negotiation to potentially become San Francisco's next wave of safe sleeping sites, public documents and City Hall insiders confirmed:  "No one wants to die from this coronavirus"  Mother Brown's shelter sees nearly 70 people sleeping in it nightly. Westbrook, the shelter's proprietor, said homelessness has grown in the Bayview so precipitously that people sometimes sleep in Mother Brown's dining room and hallways. But the COVID-19 pandemic has required many San Francisco establishments to close, or maintain strict social distancing, and Mother Brown's shelter was no different. So Westbrook and other women from the Bayview took matters into their own hands. They walked over to what locals call MLK Park – which on city documentation is called Bay View Park – and measured out the distance between plots themselves. A renegade camping site was born, from the community, serving the community, with roughly 60 souls sleeping there in tents for weeks. "When I came in early, they were all piled up in the [shelter's] doorway ... that wasn't working for us," Westbrook said. So she set up the open-air encampment without city approval. "No one wants to die from this coronavirus," Westbrook said. "But if I had waited on the city, people out here might've been dead." Eddie Tillman, 65, slipped his N95 respirator mask over and under his 49ers hat while sitting inside his blue tent. Tillman said that he is only a few years out of prison, where he was for "decades" after stealing cars in his troubled youth. Tillman was raised in the Bayview — it is his home — but his extended family is largely dead or gone. He also said he doesn't want to "burden" his adult children with his own life choices. So Tillman has been living on the streets, slowly withering away, he said. Then he found the MLK Park encampment. It not only saved him from COVID-19, he said, but from his darkest thoughts. "I [won't] say I was going to kill myself. But I didn't want to live," he said. Now Tillman says he feels upbeat once again and is better prepared to find a job. Work is also a concern for Tasha Swift, 33, who is sleeping in a tent with her boyfriend on the other side of MLK Park. Swift is an Oakland native who was living with her sister in San Francisco's Sunnydale neighborhood so the pair could support each other financially. The two parted ways amid some acrimony, and Swift found herself living in her car while still working daily shifts at Split Bread, a San Francisco restaurant. In early March, Swift was only one tantalizing paycheck away from saving enough money with her boyfriend to go apartment hunting. The cramped confines of her car would be a dreary distant memory, her locked-up knees could heal. They saved every penny, cut every expense. "You know all the things 'normal' people do to make themselves happy? I couldn't do them. I didn't even get one soda. No eating out. I cut everything," she said. Then COVID-19 hit. The Bay Area-wide shelter-in-place order was instituted March 17, and Split Bread furloughed its workers, at least, Swift still hopes, temporarily. She and her boyfriend reached into their savings to weather the financial storm, their housing dream dashed. Living in her car was "really scary, I don't like it. You never know when someone will come up to your window and rob you." But at MLK Park she's safer. Now she feels ready to get back to work. "This isn't a whole home, but it feels like it," Swift said. Soon, more San Francisco neighborhoods could become homes for other folks who've been sheltering in cars, doorways and tents. Citywide sites in the works Three sites across San Francisco are in the works to become safe sleeping sites like MLK Park. While not locked down as moving forward — various entities are still negotiating these safe sleep sites — KQED News confirmed that they are under consideration. Perhaps the furthest along in planning stages is the former site of the Temporary Transbay Terminal. An agreement between the Transbay Joint Powers Authority, which holds the lease to that parcel, and the City and County of San Francisco outlines the city's right to operate it as a safe sleeping site. The document is dated April 14. While a neighborhood group represented by lobbyist Chris Gruwell has not formally announced opposition, sources close to the matter say it spells a threat to the Temporary Transbay Terminal safe sleep site. "Sitting on an open space in the Temporary Transbay Center is basically the same thing as being in a shelter," said Gloria Li, a neighbor in South of Market who sits on the citizen advisory committee of the TJPA, and wrote to the agency to voice her concerns. "They're sharing common space. It will be a train wreck for everybody." San Francisco Supervisor Matt Haney, who represents the South of Market neighborhood where the former Temporary Transbay Terminal resides, does not support the site. "I think we should bring people into hotel rooms," Haney said. "That's safer, more cost-effective and better for public health." Everett Middle School is another site in the works. After Supervisor Rafael Mandelman's nonbinding resolution called for safe sleeping sites, he requested that the school's parking lot to be open to homeless folks sleeping there. "These makeshift encampments lack adequate social distancing as well as access to hygiene and sanitation, creating a public health hazard for encampment occupants and neighbors," Mandelman said in a statement. On Saturday an unhoused woman was found dead on the steps of Everett Middle School. My office has been in touch with the SFPD and Medical Examiner’s office to try to learn  more and will share updates as we have them. At this time no foul play is suspected, 1/3 Mark Sanchez, president of the San Francisco Board of Education, agrees. He crafted a resolution for the school board allowing the San Francisco Unified School District to enter into an agreement with the city to allow school property to be used for safe sleeping sites. While he emphasized that Everett was not yet a done deal, he did say the district is looking at only "one site" – Everett. "It does look like it will be a good site because of the growing number of people on the streets in that area," he said, adding that ultimately it will need more outreach to neighbors and a vote by the Board of Education to enact. The last site in the works is probably the least far along: a former McDonald's site in the Haight neighborhood, near Golden Gate Park, on Haight and Stanyan street. Supervisor Dean Preston has publicly touted the site, but did not respond to KQED News to speak about the effort. "Camp Breed" echoes Loma Prieta past At City Hall's front door, just past its grand lawn, lies a homeless encampment of roughly 90 tents sitting nearly on top of one another, bunched together in a nearly textbook example of how not to socially distance safely amid a pandemic. That worries Kelley Cutler, a human rights organizer with the Coalition on Homelessness. San Francisco police have parked at the encampment, and barricades have gone up, keeping people sleeping in tents penned into a tight area next to the Asian Art Museum. "They're still being contained in these small areas so they can't socially distance," Cutler said. A woman named Stephanie, who declined to give her last name, is from Daly City but went to high school in San Francisco. She had an apartment in San Francisco before falling into a drug habit and becoming homeless. She lives in the encampment near the Asian Art Museum. Stephanie wishes San Francisco would bring more services into the encampment. She spent time in a local hospital for a newly discovered diabetes diagnosis, and said navigating city services to get shelter is difficult. "I've had highs and lows. I've had five years of sobriety," Stephanie said. Now, though, she wishes she could have "harm reduction services, support services, just easy access to vocational training," so she can work. Brandon Conrad, 29, from Pacifica, also struggles with a drug problem. His mother thinks he has housing, and he doesn't want to tell her he's homeless. He's trying to help himself, but wishes the city could give him a leg up to stay safe from COVID-19 during the pandemic.

             For years, San Francisco police have ordered tents removed from city streets, even at times slashing them with knives themselves. Public Works employees have tossed the ever-ubiquitous nylon homes of desperate people into dump trucks on a weekly basis. "They won't give the shelter. They won't give us no hotel vouchers because not everybody here has a so-called chronic diagnosis," he said. "You know, we're just kind of stuck." Without adequate staffing, Conrad said, the encampment is "dangerous." Perhaps its most disturbing feature is a single bathroom for its 200 homeless dwellers. "A hundred tents and just one porta-potty in it? The bathrooms are all the way filled up with, you know, remains. It's just disgusting. Absolutely disgusting," Conrad said. People in the homeless community talking to Cutler have come up with a new name for the encampment Stephanie and Conrad live in, due to its proximity to City Hall: "Camp Breed." "Camp Breed is making it even more challenging to provide needed resources for people," Cutler said. That nickname is derived from "Camp Agnos," a homeless encampment in front of City Hall that arose in 1989 after the Loma Prieta earthquake made San Francisco homeless shelters unlivable. The growing homeless camps also torpedoed Mayor Art Agnos' second mayoral run, as his political opponents laid the burgeoning homeless problem at his feet. "As Yogi Berra said famously, it's deja vu all over again!" Agnos said. Agnos likened the COVID-19 pandemic's effect on homeless people to what happened during his tenure, post-earthquake. Shelters were unavailable then, much as they are now. "The city is struggling with a much bigger number of people than I had to deal with," he added. So will "Camp Breed" also torpedo Breed's political future? Agnos didn't think so. And touching on the fight between the San Francisco Board of Supervisors and Mayor Breed – the former who wants the homeless to be housed in hotels, and the latter who is enacting safe sleeping sites while calling hotels for homeless unreasonable – Agnos was magnanimous to all involved. "There are nuances between all their strategies, but they're all working their asses off," Agnos said.

             Theodore Johnson worked full time as a massage therapist at a luxury hotel in Texas. When the coronavirus crisis hit, he tried to get unemployment, but the system was overloaded. That sent him to an Amazon warehouse, where he now works. Until recently, Theodore Johnson worked as a massage therapist at a luxury hotel spa in Fort Worth, Texas. He worked about 30 hours a week but was a contractor. So Johnson lobbied management for a staff job to qualify for benefits. That possibility vanished when the coronavirus hit and all his work dried up.  Johnson promptly decided to apply for unemployment. It didn't go well. "I wasn't able to get through to the Texas Workforce Commission, and I wasn't sure if I was qualified. It was just chaos. The website was crashing. You literally just had a busy dial tone when you called in to the numbers," he said. "So I was just in this limbo state, and I wasn't sure how I was going to pay my bills." FACES OF THE CORONAVIRUS RECESSION  Jobs lost. Businesses in peril. Meetings gone virtual. Faces Of The Coronavirus Recession offers snapshots of working Americans whose lives have been upended by the pandemic.  That's when Johnson joined the nearby Amazon warehouse and ended up working the overnight shift filling boxes. The hourly pay at Amazon is much lower than what he earned as a massage therapist. But he's making about the same weekly wage by putting in much longer hours. He also finally got what he didn't have at the hotel spa: health insurance. "I've been working close to 60 hours [per week], and that's the cap," he says. "It's a lot of squatting. ... It's hard work." He plans to stick with the Amazon job for a bit and is reevaluating his career path by taking classes at his local community college. He said a massage may be one of the last things on people's minds right now, "because we are in a recession and maybe a depression." Read more stories in Faces Of The Coronavirus Recession.

             Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., here in February, is temporarily stepping aside as chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee during the investigation of his stock sales. He has denied any wrongdoing. Updated at 10:30 p.m. ET Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., is stepping aside temporarily as chairman of the Intelligence Committee amid a Justice Department investigation of his stock trades, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced Thursday. "Senator Burr contacted me this morning to inform me of his decision to step aside as Chairman of the Intelligence Committee during the pendency of the investigation," McConnell said in a written statement. "We agreed that this decision would be in the best interests of the committee and will be effective at the end of the day tomorrow."  Burr's move calls to mind Sen. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., who in April 2015 stepped down as ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee after being indicted on corruption charges. Those charges were eventually dismissed.  A senior Justice Department official told NPR that the FBI executed a search warrant Wednesday and seized Burr's cellphone. The Los Angeles Times first reported the news of the search. Speaking to a C-SPAN reporter Thursday, Burr said he was cooperating with investigators. "Everybody ought to let this investigation play out," he said.  When asked why he stepped away from his committee chairmanship, Burr said: "This is a distraction to the hard work of the committee and the members, and I think the security of the country is too important to have a distraction." At issue are stock trades Burr made before the market crash caused by the coronavirus pandemic. ProPublica reported that he dumped up to $1.7 million in stocks while assuring the public that the U.S. was well-positioned to withstand the outbreak. Burr and fellow Senate Republican Kelly Loeffler of Georgia faced scrutiny for dumping millions of dollars in stocks ahead of the economic downturn. Both have denied any wrongdoing.   Through a spokesperson, Loeffler declined to say if she has talked with federal investigators regarding the more than $20 million in stocks she and her husband sold following a closed-door Senate briefing on coronavirus. However, Loeffler said no warrant has been served as this time and rejected allegations of any impropriety regarding stock trades earlier this year.  "Allegations of improper trading by Sen. Loeffler are completely false based on a political attack misrepresenting the facts to prey on the emotions of the American people as they endure the impact of a global pandemic," the spokesperson said. "No search warrant has been served on Sen Loeffler. She has followed both the letter and spirit of the law and will continue to do so." Loeffler has said a third party handled the trades and she was unaware of the trades.  Loeffler's disclosures under the STOCK Act and filings through the Securities and Exchange Commission show she and her husband unloaded more than $20 million in shares following a Jan. 24 coronavirus briefing for senators.  Loeffler's husband is Jeffrey Sprecher, CEO of Intercontinental Exchange, parent company of the New York Stock Exchange.  On Thursday evening, Loeffler's spokesperson confirmed that she has "forwarded documents and information to DOJ, the SEC, and the Senate Ethics Committee establishing that she and her husband acted entirely appropriately and observed both the letter and the spirit of the law." The documents, her spokesperson says, "demonstrated her and her husband's lack of involvement in their managed accounts, as well the details of those accounts." No timeframe was specified. Two other lawmakers, Sens. James Inhofe, R-Okla., and Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., were also criticized for selling stocks ahead of the market crash, though both have said they did not have direct involvement in the sales, Reuters reported.  Feinstein spoke with federal investigators last month about her husband's stock trades. "Senator Feinstein was asked some basic questions by law enforcement about her husband's stock transactions," a spokesman told NPR. "She was happy to voluntarily answer those questions to set the record straight and provided additional documents to show she had no involvement in her husband's transactions. There have been no follow up actions on this issue." Feinstein, like Burr, is a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee. She had previously spoken to federal investigators last month, according to her spokesman.

             Stoppers are placed on filled vials of the experimental drug remdesivir at a Gilead Sciences factory. States are beginning to receive cases of an experimental COVID-19 drug that the Food and Drug Administration authorized for emergency use on May 1.  But the distribution process so far has puzzled some hospitals and states about why they've been left empty-handed. Gilead Sciences, maker of remdesivir, said it would donate its initial supply of the medicine. The federal government is in charge of coordinating where the treatment is to be shipped, with "hospitals in cities most heavily impacted by COVID-19" getting the top priority, according to a company statement. But problems were soon apparent. "We learned a lot of lessons from the remdesivir situation," FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn said during a coronavirus hearing before the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions on Tuesday. "More will be allocated according to methodology to get the drug where hospitalized patients are." In the first week of May, a dozen states received nearly 50,000 vials of remdesivir, an intravenous antiviral drug, according to the Department of Health and Human Services.  Gilead pledged to donate its initial supply of the drug, or 1.5 million doses. Of those, 607,000 will go to the United States to be administered to about 78,000 people nationwide over six weeks, according to HHS.The department did not respond to requests for comment for this story.  While remdesivir remains experimental, it has been used to treat patients with COVID-19. A study funded by the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases found that remdesivir reduced recovery time for seriously ill COVID-19 patients in the hospital by about four days, as compared to a placebo. That result intensified interest in the treatment. But in Senate testimony Tuesday, Anthony Fauci, director of the institute, stressed that the study's result for remdesivir "was statistically significant but really modest. And we must remember it was only a modest result showing that the drug made a 31% faster time to recovery."  The first remdesivir vials were distributed in two waves. One went out on May 5 directly to hospitals, and the other went out on May 7 to state health departments. AmeriSourceBergen is distributing the donated remdesivir, but has said that neither it nor Gilead had any say in where those doses went.  In Massachusetts, vials arrived directly at hospitals as part of the first wave of distribution. Dr. Helen Boucher, chief of the infectious diseases department at Tufts Medical Center, said health care providers were surprised at where they ended up. "The initial allocation went to just four hospitals, and they did not appear to be four hospitals with the greatest need," she said in an interview with NPR. "It's just not clear to me what the process was and how they decided where a 'hot spot,' is to send the drug." The hospitals that got the remdesivir decided to give it to the state health department, which reallocated it based on need, Boucher said. In the future, she said she hopes HHS can be more transparent about how it distributes the limited number of remdesivir vials. In the second wave of distribution, Maryland experienced a different distribution scenario: The state was expecting to receive 1,600 doses of the medicine.  "We will be immediately deploying these initial doses to Prince George's and Montgomery counties, where we have the highest number of cases," Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican, said during a May 6 press conference. "All of this puts us much closer to being able to launch stage one of our reopening."  According to the Maryland Department of Health, 1,200 doses went to the state health department on May 7, but they haven't been deployed yet. Still, Gabor Kelen, an emergency physician who directs the department of emergency medicine at Johns Hopkins Medicine, says Hogan's announcement caused some concern. The sickest COVID-19 patients are often transferred to University of Maryland and Johns Hopkins hospitals in Baltimore, which is outside the two hard-hit counties. "Our systems take care of a huge number of patients in the state at any one time, disproportionate to everybody else," Kelen says. "So it isn't quite right to send the drugs to smaller centers that aren't taking care of the most patients just because the smaller centers are in the hot spots." New Jersey was part of both early waves of remdesivir distribution. The New Jersey Department of Health received 110 cases of remdesivir last Thursday and was still finalizing its allocation plans as of Tuesday afternoon, according to spokeswoman Donna Leusner. The state also got 94 cases earlier in the week, but those went to hospitals in the state. (Each case contains 40 single-dose vials of the medicine.) "The Department factored in that two hospitals got direct shipments in the initial shipment to New Jersey," she said in an email to NPR. "We have advised and the federal government has agreed that all future shipments should be directed to the state." Other states, like California, Pennsylvania and Florida, have experienced among the highest numbers of COVID-19 cases in the country, but they were not among the first to receive the donated remdesivir.  The California Department of Public Health said it was "working diligently to gather more information about the distribution process to ensure Californians have access to remdesivir." Meanwhile, in Pennsylvania, officials learned on Tuesday that they would receive an allocation, but it hasn't been announced by HHS yet. Some hospitals have been told to use an online HHS portal to report every week on how many COVID-19 patients they have and how many are in the ICU. This, they've been told, will help a federal team led by Dr. Deborah Birx, White House coronavirus response coordinator, to decide where to send the donated supply of remdesivir. Several medical societies and members of Congress have called for greater transparency regarding the remdesivir distribution process.  "HHS distribution of remdesivir seems akin to winning the lottery — a random stroke of luck rather than a medically-informed decision," Reps. Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas, and Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., wrote in a May 13 letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar.  They're asking for more information on how the allocation decisions are being made and "a transparent process" for the distribution of the COVID-19 treatment.

             Muhammad Zaman, author of the new book Biography of Resistance: The Epic Battle Between People and Pathogens, in his lab at Boston University. A health crisis is rapidly unfolding worldwide. It causes suffering and death, costs billions and threatens to overwhelm health-care systems, patients and their families. No, it's not the coronavirus pandemic. It's that other disastrous health crisis: drug resistance. Bacteria and other microbes that cleverly change and evolve are outsmarting the antimicrobials once hailed as miraculous cures. Worldwide, 700,000 people die each year due to drug-resistant diseases, according to the World Health Organization.  Until a few months ago, drug-resistant disease was one of the world's top health concerns. Now it takes a back seat to the coronavirus pandemic. Muhammad Hamid Zaman is a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Professor at Boston University. His book, Biography of Resistance: The Epic Battle Between People and Pathogens, was released by Harper Wave on April 21. The Epic Battle Between People and Pathogens by Muhammad H., Ph.D. Zaman Hardcover, 304 pages | Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How? We talked to Zaman about these two epic health crises. For years, there has been concern about infectious diseases becoming resistant to the drugs that have successfully treated them ... and then wham! COVID-19 hit, utterly dominating the world's attention. How should we think about these two crises? The urgency right now is this viral disease. But we have to think of antimicrobial resistance not as detached but as something that's going on simultaneously with this pandemic. We know from history that the majority of deaths during the great 1918 flu pandemic were from secondary bacterial pneumonia. That was shown in work from Dr. Tony Fauci. People didn't die from the virus, they died of pneumonia. Today, our best arsenal against that infection is antibiotics, so if antibiotics stop working against secondary infections in this pandemic, that's a significant challenge. Is it possible COVID-19 patients are dying not of the virus but of secondary bacterial infections, like pneumonia or staph infections, just as they did in 1918? We don't know that yet. Early data from China and a recent report in the Lancet   suggest that a significant percentage of hospitalized patients are also developing secondary bacterial infections. We certainly need more data and more analysis, but we have to be concerned. With the advantage of hindsight, we can be better prepared. We know from the epidemic of 1918 that those secondary bacterial infections are a risk, and now we have antibiotics. But we can't overuse them if there's no secondary infection. Remember, antibiotics don't do anything for viruses themselves. Antibiotic resistance is caused by overuse of the drugs, the use of antibiotics in farming and the use of poor quality drugs, particularly in the developing world. What else makes bacteria fight back?  There's a constant tug of war. Some bacteria naturally produce antibiotic to gain the advantage of wiping out their competition,. Other bacteria at the same time produce resistance to antibiotics in a race to also gain a survival advantage. Our overuse and abuse, in the human and the farming sector, has tipped the scale in favor of drug resistant bacteria gaining an upper hand. Also, the prevalence of substandard and counterfeit drugs have added fuel to this fire, and increased drug resistance [to fake or substandard drugs with some but not enough real drug content so the bacteria aren't destroyed but learn to recognize and resist]. But antibiotic resistance has been going on for millions of years. Most of our antibiotics originally came from bacteria in the soil. Here's an example of how long this has been going on. Scientists discovered antibiotic resistant bacteria in a cave in New Mexico where humans had never been. So our overuse is a major driver of antibiotic resistance, but not the originator. Antibiotic resistance has been going on as long as we've had bacteria. What's the difference between bacteria and viruses like the coronavirus? The main difference is that viruses have to be in living cells to replicate. Bacteria are larger, more sophisticated and don't require a living host to replicate. They're different, but what do the two types of infections have in common? We have to recognize that nature is interconnected in many ways — animals, humans, the environment. The coronavirus likely originated in a wet market selling live [animals] in China. There is also an interaction between animals and humans in bacterial disease. This comes not only in the form of bacteria carried by animals that affect humans, like plague that goes from animals to humans via fleas, but also through the passing of drug-resistant bacteria, such as salmonella or E. coli, through the food chain from farm animals. Also, for both bacterial and viral infections, it takes time to come up with new and effective therapies. But as we wait, social distancing measures, face masks, hand washing and hygiene measures are very important, and they're the same for both. In your book, you describe bacteria as "clever." What's so clever about them, and are viruses also "clever?" The cleverness of bacteria is their ability to over time resist our best arsenal of drugs. Viruses are clever in that they can mutate in ways that are significant. That's why we need a new flu vaccine every year, because of the ability of the virus to change and adapt. If new strains of coronavirus emerge, we'd have to develop multiple vaccines. Are there lessons we failed to learn from the drug-resistance crisis that are now hampering efforts in controlling the coronavirus pandemic? One of the lessons we have not learned very well is that antibiotic resistance is a global problem. We have not had much global cooperation. That's a lesson we need to learn much better because we're seeing how quickly disease travels the globe. What's your advice on the right way to tackle global health crises?  The best response is a combination of science and empathy. Good science dictates hygiene, but we also need empathy for those who have been affected disproportionately—the elderly, the economically disadvantaged. Lockdown is important, but government has to step up to see that people get the food they need, the mental health care they need when they're isolated and lonely. We have to let both science and our humanity lead the way. Do you think science is up to the challenge of responding to the coronavirus? Science is a process. It's about facts, but it's also about uncertainty. It's a process of figuring things out in a way that's robust and rigorous and evidence based. If we do that, we're in good shape.

             President Trump speaks at medical supply distributor Owens and Minor Inc. in Allentown, Pa. Updated at 6 p.m. ET President Trump used a medical equipment distribution center in the battleground state of Pennsylvania on Thursday as a backdrop to announce he will use an international development finance agency to rebuild the U.S. stockpile of medical supplies depleted by the coronavirus pandemic. Trump told workers at a distribution center in Allentown, Pa., owned by Owens & Minor, a company that makes masks and other personal protective equipment, that he had signed an executive order giving the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation the power to issue loans to U.S. companies to boost supplies needed to respond to pandemics. "You know what a globalist is? They want the globe to do well, but they don't care about us," Trump said. "Now we want everybody to do well. But we have to take care of America first. It's got to be America first." Trump said the federal agency normally invests in economic development projects in other countries. "I said, 'How about investing in our country? We invest in other countries!' " Trump said, noting he had used the Defense Production Act to back his executive order. "Under my order, it will now also invest in our country, helping to bring vital factories, pharmaceutical producers, and most importantly jobs back home where they belong," Trump said. A White House official said loans and financing would come out of a Defense Production Act fund at the Treasury Department. Congress appropriated $1 billion to that fund as part of the March 27 CARES Act responding to the pandemic. The administration plans to rebuild the national stockpile of medical supplies to create a 90-day "buffer" for future cataclysmic events, three senior administration officials told reporters on a conference call. Over the next few months, the administration hopes to add 300 million N95 masks, 67 million medical gowns as well as critical drugs and testing supplies to the stockpile. Trump has long pushed to boost domestic manufacturing as part of his "America First" ethos and said the coronavirus pandemic proves his point about the need to bring manufacturing supply chains back to the United States from overseas. "Look, there's nothing good about what happened with the plague, OK — especially the death — but the one thing is, it said, 'Trump was right,' " Trump said in an interview that aired on Thursday on Fox Business News. Most facilities that make active ingredients for medicine sold in the United States are offshore, according to Food and Drug Administration figures.  The biggest suppliers of active pharmaceutical ingredients are India and China. During the pandemic, the U.S. also has raced to find supplies of medical equipment and test supplies from abroad. "I was getting a lot of fightback, even from people that I like a lot in Congress, and now they're not fighting," Trump said. "These stupid supply chains that are all over the world ... one little piece of the world goes bad, and the whole thing is messed up." Adam Boehler, the head of the DFC and a former top official at Health and Human Services, has been working with the White House coronavirus task force since March. In a statement, Boehler said the agency will be able to help "re-shore critical industries in our country" but "will remain unwavering in our commitment to investing in emerging markets, many of which are also suffering from this pandemic." The agency has a $60 billion investment cap for international projects. A DFC spokeswoman said none of those funds would be redirected to domestic projects.

             Protesters carrying weapons gather at the Michigan Capitol on Thursday in Lansing. Protesters are demonstrating against Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer for the coronavirus stay-at-home order in effect through May 28. Updated at 12:09 p.m. ET  Despite heavy rain, armed protesters gathered Thursday at the State Capitol in Michigan in what the organizing group, Michigan United for Liberty, has branded "judgment day." This was the third planned demonstration since Michigan has been under a stay-at-home-order from Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer to slow the spread of the coronavirus. Ahead of Thursday's protest, comments were made in private Facebook groups threatening Whitmer and lawmakers with violence, according to reporting by the Detroit Metro Times. When asked about the threats in a Wednesday appearance on ABC's The View Whitmer said, "I would be not truthful if I said it didn't bother me. It certainly does." Whitmer added, "These protests, in a perverse way, make it likelier that we're going to stay in a stay-home posture." Concern about Thursday's gathering was higher than previous protests. But rain and an interruption in planning  — Facebook reportedly removed the organizers' private group from their platform for inciting violence — may have curbed the crowd, which seemed substantially smaller than two weeks ago. That was when armed protesters brought signs that compared Whitmer to Adolf Hitler, showed nooses and Confederate flags. Some signs read, "Tyrants Get The Rope."  During that gathering, demonstrators entered the Capitol and chanted: "Our House" and "Let Us In" outside of the House chamber against a line of Michigan State Police. Many protesters didn't wear masks or follow social distancing. Some armed demonstrators entered the Senate gallery and stood above lawmakers. At least one lawmaker donned a bulletproof vest. Tensions have been brought to a boil between Whitmer and Republican leadership in the state after the governor not only rebuffed Republican plans to reopen the economy in favor of following advice of epidemiologists from the University of Michigan, but also extended the stay-at-home order through May 28. Behind all of this is an emerging battle over guns in the Michigan State Capitol. After the second protest, state Democratic lawmakers requested that the Michigan State Capitol Commission ban guns on the premises. On Monday, the Democratic attorney general issued an opinion saying the appointed body had the authority to do so and warned against a "powder keg dynamic" created by heavily armed protesters. The commission demurred and instead formed a subcommittee to study whether it had the authority to make the decision. Republican Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey later called the notion of a gun ban "cowardly" in a floor speech, calling for protesters who are threatening on Thursday to be arrested by state police. Both the governor and attorney general noted Wednesday that protesters could be charged with brandishing if they are threatening to others. "This is a terribly concerning development in that we have legislators who are showing up to work wearing bulletproof vests. That is disenfranchising thousands of people in our state if their legislator doesn't feel safe enough to go to work and to do what their job is," said Whitmer in her interview on The View. "I respect people's right to dissent, but that does not extend to endangering other people's lives and we take it very seriously," said Whitmer. Both the state House and Senate, whose schedules are decided by Republican leadership, are adjourned through Tuesday next week.

             As you trek through the wilderness of Death Stranding, you'll gradually discover you're not as alone as you think. If you were looking for a good reason to escape reality, the last six weeks of global COVID meltdown definitely fit the bill. And while pretending your dog is a sports hero or your family a famous work of art work for some, for many people only video games offer the much needed ticket out of their heads. Looking for that kind of release a week after the lockdowns began, I started playing Death Stranding, the new game by famed director Hideo Kojima. What I found there, however, was so much better than escape. Remarkably strange and complex, Kojima's game is an extended meditation on death, solitude and connection. More than just another big-studio video game, Death Stranding turns out to be a work of art perfectly synchronized to our new pandemic life. Like many other games, Death Stranding begins in a post-apocalyptic America. The main character, Sam Porter Bridges, is even played by The Walking Dead's Norman Reedus. Early in the game, Sam is tasked with knitting the nation back together by bringing new networking technology to the isolated human settlements that dot the landscape. It's Sam's estranged mother — who is also the last president of the United States — who gives him this task (and who, for some delightfully weird reason, is played by Lindsey Wagner, the star of the '70s TV show The Bionic Woman). Just before dying, Sam's mom also reveals his quest can only end with the rescue of Amelie, his sister. Amelie was sent on a similar journey three years earlier, and now she's being held hostage by terrorists resisting the reunification of the country. On the surface, this might sound like any of the hundreds of dystopian stories that clutter our culture these days. But in the hands of someone with vision, any story can transcend its genre to become something more, and Hideo Kojima is definitely an artist with vision. He's seen by many as a true auteur of game design — think Stanley Kubrick or Quentin Tarantino with a PlayStation. Kojima's famous Metal Gear Solid series invented an entirely new class of game where players could use stealth and strategy rather than just blasting their way through challenges. More importantly, Kojima brought deeply felt cinematic sensibilities to video games, weaving thoughtfully crafted stories seamlessly into gameplay. With Death Stranding Kojima wanted, once again, to create a new kind of game that would be a vehicle for exploring the biggest themes about being human in a divided society. Then, in a remarkable and unexpected synchronization of art and reality, those themes just happened to be the ones that matter most for our collective COVID journey. You spend a lot of time alone in Death Stranding. In this broken world, Sam is a "porter," whose dangerous work mostly involves bringing supplies to desperate people. (That narrative alone links the game to so many of our COVID situations.) But as you trek over fractured landscapes, weighed down by hundred pounds of cargo, the game lets you find connections and assistance. One of the most remarkable aspects of Death Stranding is the way other players appear. This is absolutely a single player game, but as you make your way across its rough terrain, you'll find the imprint of these others: There are ropes and ladders for climbing steep cliffs and bridges laid down for crossing swift rivers. All of these were created by other players working through their own versions of the game. They left these aids for you, in your own journey, just as you can provide aid for them. ... even though you are alone as you travel, there are always others out there just like you, facing the same challenges and leaving signs that none of us are alone.  So even though you are alone as you travel, there are always others out there just like you, facing the same challenges and leaving signs that none of us are alone. This rich and complex game mechanic beautifully echoes the world we're living in now. It's also a remarkable example of how a game can function as art, giving us more intimacy with our own experiences of loneliness or the urge to be of service — experiences that turn out be universal as we all face coronavirus-changed lives. And just like our strange new reality, what you're often alone with on your journey through the game is the fear of death. Of course, most every video game presents players with the possibility of death, after which comes the familiar "respawn" (minus some game goodies or experience points or whatever). But it's death itself that comprises the central tension in the game. The apocalypse in Death Stranding began with the discovery of the Beach, a parallel reality which is nothing less than the land of the dead (or one location there). State-sized explosions called "voidouts," resulting from direct contact between the living and dead, are what left America in its fractured state. Then came the BTs (Beached Things), dangerous spirits of the dead who inhabit the wastelands between human settlements. There they wait, ready to drag living travelers down through black, liquid depths to the other side. I've played more than my fair share of games that traverse the underworld, but that's not what's happening with Death Stranding. Kojima is exploring a particular, and particularly mythic vision of the interplay of death and life in this game. That's what makes the Beach and the BT's simultaneously strange, beautiful and terrifying. It's also also what connects the story to the lives we inhabit now standing that much closer to our mortality Many times, I came away from my time in 'Death Stranding' quietly reflective about the ways we build bridges to each other even in peril and isolation. Great art often works on the level of myth. Not myth in the sense of stories that never happened, but Joseph Campbell's sense of stories that are always happening. So, it may look like Death Stranding is about Sam trying to unite America, but really America is just a stand-in for all of us. It's our condition as human beings to be broken and separated, making our own journey in the shadow of death. But it is also our condition to seek and find connection in spite of it all. That is the landscape Kojima wants us, through Sam, to explore and gain greater vision from. And that's how Death Stranding teaches in the way Karen Armstrong meant when she wrote, in A Short History of Myth, that a myth "is essentially a guide; it tells us what we must do to live more richly." And that, finally, is what Kojima meant when he wrote, "Through your experience playing the game, I hope you'll come to understand the true importance of forging connections with others" Many times, I came away from my time in Death Stranding quietly reflective about the ways we build bridges to each other even in peril and isolation. And in these difficult weeks, that experience was so much better than just a few hours of escape.

                With meatpacking plants reducing processing capacity nationwide, U.S. hog farmers are bracing or an unprecedented crisis: the need to euthanize millions of pigs.

             With meatpacking plants reducing processing capacity nationwide, U.S. hog farmers are bracing or an unprecedented crisis: the need to euthanize millions of pigs. Third generation hog farmer Chad Leman, making his daily rounds, points to dozens of 300-pound pigs. "These pigs should be gone," he said. He means gone to the meatpacking plant to be processed. But with pork processing plants shut down due to worker safety concerns, he's faced with a grisly task: He needs to kill the pigs to make room for more. And Leman isn't the only one. With meatpacking plant closures and reduced processing capacity nationwide, America's hog farmers expect an unprecedented crisis: the need to euthanize millions of pigs. The meatpacking industry is being ravaged by the Coronavirus crisis, and thousands of employees have reportedly tested positive for COVID-19. This has led to a significantly reduced capacity for processing hogs into pork, which is forcing farmers like Leman to make the difficult decision to euthanize their pigs. Jason Lusk, the head of the agricultural economics department at Purdue University, estimates that there is currently a 40 percent reduction in meat processing capacity, which will lead to 200,000 pigs per day being left on their farms. "That's a million extra pigs that would have gone to market, but instead are staying on the farm, from just one week," Lusk said. Hogs ready for slaughter cannot be easily held on farms because of their fast rate of growth. Pigs that are held much longer than six months after birth grow too large for processing, and meat processing plants typically won't accept hogs larger than 300 pounds. "Nationwide, as an industry, we're thinking right now, given what we know, somewhere between five and ten million" hogs for euthanization, said Leman, a farmer from Eureka, Ill., and a board member of the Illinois Pork Producers Association. Before the Coronavirus crisis, pork production was a finely-tuned, just-in-time supply chain. During normal times, this led to efficiency and the reduction of the cost to produce pork. Now, it is a significant burden to hog farmers who will have nowhere to sell their ready-for-market pigs. "The system is built for certain sized pigs to go to the processor, and to be in the barns," said Heather Hill, a multi-generational hog farmer living in Greenfield, Ind. "So even by tweaking their diets and trying to slow down how fast they're growing, the pigs are still going to continue to get bigger." Hill and her husband sell 30,000 pigs to market per year, and typically send 500 to 600 pigs to slaughter each week. But for now, they're holding more pigs on the farm than they typically do. "Each load of pigs we can't sell, it definitely creates a domino effect, where we have a backlog of pigs," she told NPR. Most farmers don't want to talk about the prospect of euthanizing pigs, but considering the reduction in processing capacity, it has become almost inevitable that farmers in the American Midwest will need to consider what to do with the pigs that they can neither sell nor afford to hold on to. "What the challenge has become, now, is that we didn't realize how long these plants were going to be down," Leman said. "And so now the problem is going to linger for far longer than we thought. I mean, I think we're going to have shipping disruptions now until at least July or August." The tragedy of euthanizing millions of pigs is compounded by the fact that other parts of America face unemployment, poverty and hunger. But without meat processing, you can't turn pigs into pork. "There's conversations going on every day... to figure out how can we most efficiently and humanely do this," Leman said. "This is not about euthanizing half a dozen animals. This is thousands and millions of animals. This is just an unforeseen calamity, really." And beyond just killing the hogs there's an open question about what to do with the many, many 300-pound carcasses. The logistics alone are difficult to contemplate: while most farmers have euthanized pigs before in small numbers, doing so for large groups of pigs requires more sophisticated equipment — after all, once they're killed, the heavy pigs need to be transported for disposal. The large numbers prevent easy solutions, like giving away the pigs to food pantries — for which they would have to go through processing plants. One possibility is the disposal of carcasses in massive landfills. And to make matters worse for Leman: Last weekend a polar vortex swept through the Midwest and froze some of his emerging crop of soybeans, which he uses to feed pigs. This means he'll have to replant acres and acres of soybeans, even as he deals with the pork crisis. "My wife and I have a longstanding joke between us. She always says, 'well Chad, it could be worse,'" Leman told NPR. 'And I say, 'I know, but it could be better!'"

             President Donald Trump, flanked by tables holding testing supplies and machines, speaks during a press briefing about coronavirus testing in the Rose Garden of the White House on May 11, 2020 in Washington, D.C. The White House has touted the fact that its coronavirus task force provided each state with a list of labs that could potentially test for the virus, but officials in a number of states told NPR that the lists did not actually help them increase testing. The White House task force has said for weeks that testing in the U.S. is going smoothly, and that it is helping states gear up to check more people for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. That capacity is still lacking in many places that are considering re-opening their economies after locking down in an attempt to slow the spread of the virus. On April 20, President Trump said that the task force had given each state a list of labs that could offer additional testing capacity. He later said this had quickly produced dramatic results. "One week ago, we provided each governor with a list of names, addresses, and phone numbers of the labs where they could find additional testing capacity in their states," said President Trump during one of the task force's daily briefings. "Within 48 hours, the number of tests performed across the country began to absolutely skyrocket." NPR reached out to all 50 state health departments to ask about their testing efforts, including what impact the the task force's list had. Twenty-five states responded to NPR's questions, though not all answered specific questions about the task force's lists of labs. Of those that did, however, only one — Alabama — said the list it received had helped. Representatives from nine states said that the list had been reviewed but had not produced more testing. Six states said that the lists hadn't even been seen or reviewed — at least as far as the responding official knew.   "We don't recall seeing this list, but we believe we know the labs in state and out of state that are available to us currently," replied Elizabeth Goodsitt, a communications specialist with the Wisconsin Department of Health Services, who noted that her state already had an established network of clinical labs. Officials from the Colorado State Joint Information Center replied that the list they received had been reviewed but "it did not identify any labs we were not aware of." Representatives from Idaho and South Carolina also responded that officials there had seen the list, but that it did not result in any additional testing. Minnesota officials replied that they had reviewed the list but when asked if it had led to an increase in testing, replied "not yet." In Wyoming, the list was reviewed, but, according to officials, it did not provide any useful new information because it included veterinary or research labs that did not have the regulatory approval needed to perform diagnostic medical testing for people. The labs that had the necessary approvals "were already performing COVID testing," explains Kim Deti, a public information officer at Wyoming's Department of Health. Other states cited similar problems. "The list from the White House omitted some labs that are doing testing and included sites that do not have current capacity to do COVID-19 testing," said Robert Long, communications director at Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention. The lack of testing supplies was also a concern for some officials, who noted that the labs on the list had testing machines, but did not have the materials such as swabs and testing chemicals they needed to perform coronavirus tests. "Oregon had already surveyed labs to identify what instruments are already in the field," said Robb Cowie, a spokesperson for the Oregon Health Authority, referring to the testing machines. "The issue is that these instruments are not being supplied with the reagents/test cartridges needed to run to their maximum capacity." Similarly, the list received by Montana did not result in any increase in testing because the laboratories on that list are not receiving "an adequate supply of kits, reagents and supplies," according to Jon Ebelt, a public information officer for Montana's Department of Public Health and Human Services. "We received a partial list of laboratories that have equipment, have reviewed the list and provided feedback to the Governor's Coronavirus Task Force," Ebelt said. "The list outlined test equipment but did not delve into testing supply availability for that equipment." Vermont officials did review the list received from the task force, but it did not have any effect as the state does "not need increased lab capacity at this time," according to Erik Filkhorn, a spokesperson for Vermont's health operations center. On April 20, the day that the lists of labs went out, Maryland Governor Larry Hogan noted on a conference call with the coronavirus task force that the list given to his state included federal labs that the state couldn't access, despite his having tried to get access for more than a month. That, plus the news that Maryland had obtained a half-million testing kits from South Korea, seemed to draw a swift rebuke from the president. "Some of the governors, like, as an example, the governor from Maryland, didn't really understand the list," said President Trump. "He didn't understand too much about what was going on. So, now I think he'll be able to do that. It's pretty simple. But they have tremendous capacity and we hope to be able to help him out." Hogan responded by immediately writing a letter to the president thanking him for his "generous offer" and asking for assistance in securing access to testing equipment in federal labs. Last week, a spokesperson for the Maryland Department of Health told NPR that it "has been in discussions with the National Institutes of Health and other federal labs in the state about processing COVID-19 tests." The NIH, however, seemed to suggest that such discussions either were no longer happening or had not been fruitful. "NIH's laboratories support clinical research conducted at the NIH Clinical Center and testing of NIH staff suspected of coronavirus infection," a spokesperson told NPR. "NIH does not currently have the laboratory capacity to support testing beyond our own staff and Clinical Center patients." Alabama is the only state where officials told NPR that the list had been reviewed and that it had resulted in increased testing. "Some additional commercial labs were beginning to test" for the virus, said Karen Landers of the Alabama Department of Public Health. "These were additional resources for the citizens of the state." Landers said how much testing was added "varies" depending on "whether labs have issues with collection supplies, reagents, and so forth which can happen with any lab depending on demand." Federal officials continue to cite the task force lists that were given to the states as an important step in ramping up the nation's testing. During testimony to lawmakers on Tuesday, for example, White House coronavirus task force member Admiral Brett Giroir noted that the government had "detailed the location and capacity of every lab machine in every state that could potentially run COVID-19" tests. And an official with the task force, when asked by NPR if there was any evidence that these lists had significantly assisted states, said that "the success of this effort is in the increased testing the nation has seen in recent weeks due to states tapping into unused capacity."Nightmares. Tantrums. Regressions. Grief. Violent outbursts. Exaggerated fear of strangers. Even suicidal thoughts. In response to a call on social media, parents across the country shared with NPR that the mental health of their young children appears to be suffering as the weeks of lockdown drag on. Most U.S. states have canceled in-person classes for the rest of the academic year. This week in Senate testimony, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, sounded a cautionary note on the prospect of reopening school buildings nationwide, even in the fall. He pointed to the emergence of serious inflammatory illness in a handful of children. "We don't know everything about this virus, and we really better be very careful, particularly when it comes to children," Fauci said. He was responding to this comment by Sen. Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky: "I think it's a huge mistake not sending our kids back to school." Dr. Dimitri Christakis, one of the nation's most prominent pediatricians, agrees with Paul, who is a physician by training. Christakis, who directs the Center for Child Health, Behavior and Development at Seattle Children's Hospital, is the editor-in-chief of the journal JAMA Pediatrics. And in a new piece published in the journal, he argues that the risks to children's learning, social-emotional development and mental health need to be better balanced with the risks of spreading the coronavirus. "I don't care if I die" Sarah, a mom in Northern California, is one of many parents who responded to our query about how their children are handling the shutdown. She and her husband work in the tech industry and have two daughters. Their older daughter, Phoebe, turned 5 just as their area's stay-at-home orders went into effect. Her birthday party had to be postponed. "She has happy moments and laughs about things and plays and gets excited," says Sarah (we're not using her last name to protect her daughter's privacy). But, she adds, Phoebe has also "started saying some things that were really freaking me out." One day, Sarah says, she asked her daughter to be more careful on the stairs in their house. "And she got indignant and she was like, 'Why? It's my choice if I fall and kill myself.' " Another day, Phoebe asked to join her mother on a trip to the post office. "I told her no. And she's like, 'Why? I don't care if I die.' " Sarah asked, " 'Can you tell me more about that, please?' And she's like, 'Well, you have an extra kid [her baby sister] and [she]'s a good kid and I'm a bad kid.' " Sarah says she's lucky that she has been able to take administrative leave from her job to be with her daughters full time during the lockdown and that they have mental health coverage. But it has been difficult finding a therapist who can treat a young child over video chat. "An imperative" Christakis says the serious effects of this crisis on children like Phoebe have been overlooked. "The decision to close schools initially, and now to potentially keep them closed, isn't, I think, taking the full measure of the impact this is going to have on children," he told NPR. "Not just the short term, but the long term." The problem, Christakis says, isn't just learning loss, which is expected to fall particularly hard on low-income children with unequal access to distance learning. Recent research from a large testing association on the "COVID-19 slide" suggests children may return in the fall having made almost a third less progress in reading, and half as much progress in math, compared with what they would have in a typical school year. Mental health and social-emotional development, Christakis argues, have been less discussed: "The social-emotional needs of children to connect with other children in real time and space, whether it's for physical activity, unstructured play or structured play, this is immensely important for young children in particular." A new study in JAMA Pediatrics, he says, documents elevated depression and anxiety among children under lockdown in China. A third major risk, says Christakis, is child abuse. With schools closed and activities canceled, adults who are mandatory reporters, such as teachers, are less likely to catch wind of abuse or neglect. Hospitals around the country are reporting a rise in admissions for severe child abuse injuries and even deaths — a rise that coincides with lockdown orders. And a sex-abuse hotline operated by the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network reported that half its calls in March came from minors, for the first time in its history. In his editorial, Christakis calls for a panel made up of interdisciplinary experts to make school reopening a priority in the United States. "I think we should sort of reason backwards from the expectation that children do start school, that that's an imperative. And then how do we make that happen safely?" Safety, of course, is the reason schools closed around the world in the first place. It's still considered very rare for children to become seriously ill from the coronavirus, but recently a handful of children have died from an inflammatory illness related to COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. The science on children's role in spreading the virus is also a moving target. A new analysis of Chinese contact-tracing data in the journal Science, co-authored by Maria Litvinova, suggests that children are in fact less susceptible to coronavirus infections. But because they have so much close contact at school, canceling in-person classes plays a key role in flattening the curve of an outbreak. Litvinova says she is doubtful that schools, especially in big cities, can reliably enforce social distancing to reduce the number of contacts. "It's very difficult to explain to children that they shouldn't stay with their friends or talk with them or be close to each other." Christakis is himself an epidemiologist by training. But he says these concerns are exactly why experts from different backgrounds need to be consulted, so that the risks of reopening schools can be properly balanced with the risks of keeping them closed. "If we declared the meat supply a national emergency, we should do the same with the brain supply."

             Rick Bright arrives to testify before the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health on Thursday. Updated at 4:42 p.m. ET Rick Bright, a career government scientist-turned-whistleblower, told a congressional panel Thursday that without a stronger federal response, the coronavirus threatens to make 2020 the "darkest winter in modern history." Bright testified before the Democratic-led House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health, which called the hearing after Bright filed a whistleblower complaint about being removed from his post as director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA). At the hearing Thursday, which began with a moment of silence for the more than 80,000 people who have died in the United States as a result of COVID-19, Bright said he believes "we could have done better" in responding to the coronavirus back in January when its deadly effects became apparent.     He told lawmakers that he raised the need to obtain samples of the virus in meetings with Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar. Once the virus began spreading, he said, his alarms were not responded to with action. Bright said he was told that his "urgings were causing a commotion," and he was removed from relevant meetings. Dr. Rick Bright: "I was told that my urgings were causing a commotion and I was removed from those meetings."Full video here: https://t.co/2qnGXlaRG2 pic.twitter.com/GJjbKMqM8P Bright added that "time is running out" and that the window is closing to address the pandemic "because we still do not have a standard, centralized, coordinated plan to take our nation through this response."  He spoke at length about his concerns with the supply of personal protective equipment. He said as far back as 2007 there were shortages of equipment such as N95 respirators. Bright said he will "never forget" emails he received from the head of a Texas company that produces surgical masks saying that the nation's supply chain for PPE was completely decimated as the coronavirus pandemic began.   "We're in deep s***," the email from Michael Bowen said, according to Bright.  Bowen, who testified after Bright, is vice president of surgical mask producer Prestige Ameritech. Bowen said he sent emails to Bright and other federal officials over a 13-year period, warning of a shortage of U.S.-made masks.

             "America has a weakness for low prices," Bowen said, when talking about U.S. entities purchasing masks from abroad. At one point, Bowen said he was a "lifelong Republican, and I'm embarrassed" by how the pandemic has been handled. Bright testified that supply chain issues continue and that some respirators being used were poorly manufactured.  "Nurses are rushing into hospitals thinking they're protected and they're not," he said. Bright also cast doubt on the likelihood of a vaccine being developed in the next 12 to 18 months.  "A lot of optimism is swirling around a 12- to 18-month time frame, if everything goes perfectly," he said. "We've never seen everything go perfectly."  Loading...  The Trump administration response Azar pushed back on Bright's testimony, telling reporters at the White House on Thursday, "Everything he's complaining about was achieved." He noted that the administration has acquired respirators and embarked upon a "Manhattan Project" for vaccines called Operation Warp Speed. "While we're launching Operation Warp Speed, he's not showing up for work to be part of that," Azar said. "His allegations do not hold water. They do not hold water." President Trump said that he had seen some of Bright's testimony. "I watched this guy for a little while this morning. To me, he's nothing more than a really disgruntled, unhappy person," Trump said, echoing an earlier dismissal of Bright. The complaint Bright contends that he was removed from his post as director of BARDA by top HHS officials because he was pushing for coronavirus funding to go toward "safe and scientifically vetted solutions, and not for drugs, vaccines and other technologies that lack scientific merit," according to his prepared testimony, released Tuesday by the subcommittee. Bright contends that his transfer to a lower-ranking post at HHS came because of his reluctance to promote use of the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine to treat patients with COVID-19, which had been touted by Trump and others. Bright's attorneys say the Office of Special Counsel has determined there were "reasonable grounds" to believe that his removal from his post at BARDA was retaliatory and therefore prohibited. The OSC says it can't comment on an open case.  As Bright testified, HHS issued a statement saying his whistleblower complaint "is filled with one-sided arguments and misinformation. HHS said it is reviewing the complaint and strongly disagrees with the allegations and characterizations made by Rick Bright."  The statement added that Bright did not see "the full strategic and operational picture across HHS and the Administration as a whole — because his role within HHS was more limited." "The darkest winter" Bright painted a gloomy picture of a possible future unless the Trump administration responds more quickly and more strongly to the coronavirus.  "It is painfully clear that we were not as prepared as we should have been," Bright said in his prepared remarks. "We missed early warning signals and we forgot important pages from our pandemic playbook." "Our window of opportunity is closing," Bright warned. "If we fail to develop a national coordinated response, based in science, I fear the pandemic will get far worse and be prolonged, causing unprecedented illness and fatalities. "The undeniable fact is there will be a resurgence of the COVID-19 this fall, greatly compounding the challenges of seasonal influenza and putting an unprecedented strain on our health care system," he added. "Without clear planning and implementation of the steps that I and other experts have outlined, 2020 will be darkest winter in modern history."
                Research indicates that smokers and vapers are at increased risk of more serious illness if they get infected with the novel coronavirus.

             Research indicates that smokers and vapers are at increased risk of more serious illness if they get infected with the novel coronavirus. In 40 years of smoking, Katie Kennedy has tried four times to quit but always went back to cigarettes. Today, she is summoning a new mental image when a craving comes on: rows of COVID-19 patients hooked to ventilators. Kennedy's dad also smoked. He was on a ventilator before he died, and seeing how invasive the machine was, and watching his discomfort and distress, made Kennedy vow not to die like that. "I just decided it's time to protect my lungs as much as I can," says Kennedy, 59, who started a cessation class in Sacramento, California, in March. "COVID-19 is quite a motivator." Early studies suggest that smokers who develop COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, are 14 times more likely to need intensive treatment compared with nonsmokers. Doctors in California are seizing this moment to highlight the connection between COVID-19 and smoking as another reason people should quit.

             The toll-free California Smokers' Helpline ― 1-800-NO-BUTTS — which offers free cessation advice, is redirecting research money to provide two weeks of free nicotine patches, sent directly to a caller's home. Calls to the help line in March were down 27.5% compared with the same month last year — which the staff attributes mainly to people being too stressed out to consider quitting. Nonetheless, staffers say that some of the smokers who do call mention the coronavirus — and the upheaval of the state's stay-at-home order — as their inspiration to quit. "I spoke with a gentleman last week who is seriously taking this time to reorganize his life," says Nallely Espina, a counselor with the help line. "He's setting a new routine for himself at home and staying away from his smoker friends, which was one of his main triggers." A man in his mid-20s was prompted to call after he read a news article about how even young people who smoke could have more severe health complications from the virus, Espina says. About half of her callers are using the time at home to revamp their habits: start yoga, meditation or a healthier diet. The rest seem supremely frazzled, being trapped inside with their families. Espina helped one dad devise new coping strategies. "Going outside and having that cigarette, it's his time out from the kids," she says. "So for him, we decided let's still go outside, but instead of having a cigarette, maybe you spend those minutes doing a few push ups and burpees? And he loved that idea. He went for it." California public health agencies are incorporating information about the link between smoking and the coronavirus into their social media and public outreach messages, building on a 30-year legacy of aggressive anti-smoking campaigns and policies. The state was the first to ban smoking on airplanes and in restaurants and bars, adding a long list of other public spaces over the years that made smoking logistically difficult and culturally unpopular. As a result, California has the second-lowest smoking rate in the country ― 11.3% — after Utah, where only 8.9% of the population smokes and Mormon values are credited with discouraging the habit. While counselors nudge smokers to quit, researchers are wondering whether California's low smoking rate will affect how the state fares during the pandemic. "It's a really great question," says Ruth Malone, a professor emerita of nursing at the University of California-San Francisco. She has studied tobacco control policy for 20 years. "Smokers do much worse if they contract the virus, which is not too surprising given that it attacks lung tissue. There also is some new research suggesting that it might even promote transmission because of the particular pathways that it hooks on to." Establishing a correlation between smoking and COVID-19 outcomes would require sophisticated modeling techniques, so that smoking could be isolated from the many risk factors that help determine geographic differences in the spread and severity of the virus. Those factors include population density, poverty rates, and the number of days between the arrival of the virus in a community and the enactment of mitigation measures, such as shelter-at-home orders. California was among the first states to institute such measures. Researchers have long known that smoking makes it harder to fight off respiratory infections, because it increases mucus production and paralyzes cilia, the hairlike fibers in the respiratory tract and lungs that normally flush out invaders. "If any organism gets down there in the lower airways, whether it's the coronavirus or another virus, you've got the mucus that it can get stuck in, and it can't get whisked away because the cilia are not working," says Dr. John Swartzberg, professor emeritus of infectious diseases at University of California-Berkeley. "So those organisms have a perfect home." Recent scientific research indicates smoking may also increase a person's chance of contracting this particular coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, because of tobacco's effect on a cell receptor called angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2). Scientists believe the coronavirus latches on to this receptor and uses it to enter cells, says Marcos García-Ojeda, an immunologist at UC-Merced. The problem is that smoking increases levels of ACE2 Imagine a human cell as a house with doors and windows where the virus can enter, García-Ojeda explains: "If you smoke, now you have increased the amount of windows and doors for the virus to come in," he says. Still, other scientists hypothesize that the virus enters cells through a different receptor — one that nicotine may be able to block. Researchers in France plan to explore whether wearing a nicotine patch may help prevent infection, while acknowledging that smokers who do develop COVID-19 are more likely to experience more severe symptoms. Tobacco-control advocates are calling on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to collect more robust data on the connection between smoking and the coronavirus. The development of a reliable and widely available coronavirus antibody test could also help characterize the connection. "Once we start doing very robust antibodies studies, we'll be able to take a population of people infected and sese how many of them are smokers versus nonsmokers. Then you could see what the morbidity in each group is," says Swartzberg. "That study would be very simple to do." Figuring out whether low smoking rates contribute to a reduction in overall infections would be harder, requiring more complex models that can control for other potential factors. For example, the smoking rate in New York City, which became a huge coronavirus hot-spot, is roughly the same as California's. That could either invalidate the idea that a low smoking rate is protective, experts say, or indicate that smoking is just one of many, many variables that influence the impact of the outbreak. "[California] went to physical-distancing policies and closing nonessential businesses a few days earlier than New York. I think those were a critical few days," says Dr. John Balmes, a pulmonologist and professor of medicine at UCSF. California cities also tend to be less densely populated than Eastern cities, Balmes adds. In the meantime, doctors are relying on what they do know about smoking's harms to persuade people to try to quit smoking now. "Once you stop smoking or vaping, your lungs, your immune system, they start getting better within minutes," says Dr. Elisa Tong, a physician at UC-Davis and project director for the University of California Tobacco Cessation Leadership Center. Katie Kennedy of Sacramento has been learning these lessons at her smoking cessation class, which moved to online sessions. Being cooped up at home has presented some challenges for her. "My husband smokes," Kennedy says. "And that's probably the biggest trigger." It was their ritual, to smoke together. The times she has relapsed, it was always with him. Now that they're stuck at home together around the clock, there's constant temptation. "There is the thought that passes through my brain, 'Oh, he's going out for a cigarette. That sounds good,'" she says. "Well, when I get that urge, I know it's the nicotine talking. So I pop a nicotine lozenge and take a deep breath and try to busy myself with something else."

As this pandemic progresses, more of us will brush shoulders with loss. The death of someone you care about deeply can be so gut wrenching and annihilating that you may be left unable to imagine ever regaining your equilibrium. And if you're there right now, just know you won't be in that painful place forever. Explore Life Kit This story comes from Life Kit, NPR's podcast with tools to help you get it together. To listen to this episode, play the audio at the top of the page or find it here. I know, because that happened to me in early fall of 2017. That's when I lost my partner of three years in a motorcycle wreck. His death flattened me. For two weeks, I couldn't eat. And for months after the accident, I barely slept, anxiety and exhaustion my constant companions. I came to believe that I'd never crawl out of the desolation. But with proper care and attention, grief eases its heart-clenching grip. And, says grief expert Terri Daniel, embrace it fully and it can shake you alive and awake like nothing else. "It's an opening to a new world, a new self, higher awareness, spiritual growth — whatever you allow to come in," says Daniel. "And it leads to greater peace in life." Daniel knows this firsthand. In 2006, she lost her 16-year-old son to metachromatic leukodystrophy, a rare metabolic disorder. "It was a progressively degenerative disease. He went from being a perfectly normal kid to in a wheelchair, unable to speak or manage his own body in any way," she says.   She offers these five strategies to help you cultivate a healthy relationship with grief. Tending to grief requires us to be with it, in all its misery and messiness. "We want to find a place where we can be present with it rather than be in resistance to it," Daniel says. "It's an old Buddhist teaching of sitting with uncertainty, sitting with discomfort. And that's the real tool we need for being with grief."  It's not easy. But doing so is key to embarking on the "tasks of grieving," which span the entire grieving process.   Psychologist William Worden developed the concept, which involves four main tasks: acceptance of the loss, processing that loss, adjusting to life without the deceased person and finding ways to maintain an enduring connection with your loved one as you continue your life. Daniel suggests thinking of the tasks of grieving as you do other recurring tasks in life. You face the discomfort and do the work because a healthy mourning process demands our presence. The tasks differ from the "stages of grief" made famous by Elisabeth Kubler-Ross. She described the denial, anger, bargaining, depression and finally acceptance that a person goes through when facing their own death.  One thing is certain: Sidestepping grief isn't an option. Numbing the pain with work, alcohol or other drugs only delays the inevitable, says Sonya Lott, a Philadelphia-based psychologist. "We have to move through it, or it will continue to show up in insidious ways in every aspect of our being: physically, cognitively, emotionally, spiritually," says Lott.  The acute pain will subside, but the pain of loss never fully leaves us. It finds us at unexpected moments. When you're in the throes of acute grief, this may sound untenable. But Daniel says, given time and space, grief matures into an old, comfortable friend. It has been more than 13 years since Daniel lost her son. And when a wave of sadness hits her shore, she embraces it. "I like to say, 'Hello, grief. ... I don't want you to be here, but I'm going to make friends with you because I can't get rid of you. So come on in and sit with me, and I will be your friend,' " Daniel says. "That's how you heal. That's how it strengthens you." Paint, sculpt, throw clay, dance, bake, journal — whatever feels right.  And reach out to trusted friends or family members who get it. "One of the things a grieving person needs more than anything else is to tell their story and be heard," she says. Many people benefit from support groups or time with a grief counselor. If after a year, you still feel stuck, you could be moving into complicated grief. While regular grief doesn't usually require therapeutic intervention, that changes with complicated grief, says Lott.  She specializes in treating the condition, also known as prolonged grief disorder. Lott says it's diagnosed when a person experiences acute grief that interferes with their daily functioning more than a year after the death. A host of factors puts people at risk for complicated grief, Lott says. Among them are multiple losses within a short period, preexisting mental health conditions and unexpected deaths. For that there's an evidence-based treatment called complicated grief therapy. You'll have to find someone like Lott who specializes in this, and it involves between 16 and 20 therapy sessions.  If you need help finding a therapist, there's a Life Kit for that too. The journey through grief is not linear.  "So you're sad, you're crying, you can't get out of bed. You're angry. That's loss," Daniel says. "Then you get out of bed and you go write in your journal and take a walk in nature — that's restoration. Back and forth, back and forth. As long as you're moving between those two focuses all the time and you're not stagnant, you're gonna be fine." Eventually, you'll find yourself residing mostly in restoration, which is healthy but also sometimes brings its own challenges.  "There's so much guilt that comes with that," she says. "We feel that holding on to our pain keeps us connected to our loved one, and it's not true." Instead, Daniel and other grief experts urge you to find a positive way of remaining connected. Doing so is one of those important tasks of healing. For some, it's as simple as framing a favorite photo or planting a tree. For others, it's getting a tattoo. Or in the case of Daniel, adopting her son Danny's first name as her last. In early grief, the change to your life is unwelcome. But grief is supposed to change you, Daniel says. And for many of us, the healing period brings new passions and sometimes an entirely new direction in life. You may find yourself starting a charity, volunteering or going back to school. For me, it has been to better understand profound grief so that I can continue healing and, when possible, help others through it. "The term that we use in counseling is 'meaning-making,' " Daniel says. "You make meaning out of your life." We'd love to hear how you're coping during the coronavirus pandemic.

             Wuhan Diary: Dispatches from a Quarantined City, by Fang Fang In her now-world-famous writing, Chinese author Fang Fang implores: "The departed are gone, but the living must go on. As before. I just hope we can remember." The writer's detailed account of the novel coronavirus outbreak in the Chinese city of Wuhan, originally published in Chinese as a daily diary as the virus rapidly spread there, becomes available in English on Friday as Wuhan Diary: Dispatches from a Quarantined City. Bits and clips of Fang Fang's writing on the situation in Wuhan made it out of China and into English as the outbreak was unfolding, but now the full account will be available in English. Memory is central to Fang Fang's diary. So is making sense of the complete absence of things: of life as we knew it; of any and all economic activity. Like tens of millions of other readers, I read Fang Fang in the monotony of self-isolation, looking for a common understanding of how the pandemic had changed the country we were living in — China. Before the novel coronavirus engulfed the Chinese city of Wuhan, Fang Fang was already an award-winning novelist of realist fiction. But her chronicle of the lockdown of her hometown Wuhan might be her most lasting work. Fang Fang penned her first entry on January 25, two days after the city was suddenly sealed off from the rest of China, to let friends and anyone curious understand "what is really going on here on the ground in Wuhan." Over the next 59 entries spanning more than two months, her writing veers from a collection of the quotidian aspects of life under lockdown to her mounting frustration with local officials — no small gesture of bravery in China. Out of necessity, her diary supersedes any kind of traditional literary work, in both content and form. By early February, China's Internet censors were working overtime, during the height of the epidemic, to erase critical content. Fang Fang's diary thus often serves as an archive, describing videos and news items usually deleted by the time she managed to publish her daily entry. As her online diary begins to attract millions of readers, she begins incorporating information gleaned from text messages and phone calls from well-connected friends in the arts and medical fields, forming a kind of written collage of Wuhan. Eventually, the censors came for Fang Fang. Loyal readers took screenshots of her entries before they were deleted, or helped repost entires on various other social media channels. Unfortunately, the English translation of her diary in book form is not able to capture this multidimensionality. Wuhan Diary loses much of its engaging, real-time nature by condensing her 60 entries into a single tome. Nonetheless, it is a heroic feat of speedy translation from veteran Michael Berry. "You have that whole connecting universe extending from her diary entries...of course, reading it now, after the fact, is a very different experience," Berry, who is also translating Fang Fang's last novel, Soft Burial, told NPR. Still, readers in the U.S. will likely find many of her gripes about local officials and the burden of social distancing all too relevant. Fang Fang's Wuhan diary remains significant as a document of the trivial, tragic and absurd during Wuhan's 76 days of lockdown. Such a document is especially important now, when so much of how the coronavirus spread — and what governments across the world did or did not do to contain it — is already being contested by the U.S. and China. "Imagine this: the author Fang Fang did not exist in today's Wuhan...What would we have heard? What would we have seen?" asked writer Yan Lianke in a widely-shared online talk in late February. Memory, Yan goes on to say, is the most basic hedge against future injustice: "While memories may not give us the power to change reality, it can at least raise a question in our hearts when a lie comes our way." Fang Fang's diary, then, is an important record how Wuhan's people suffered and ultimately persevered, even as the state wants to erase its initial fumbles from the official record. Raising questions does not make one popular in China these days. Nearly immediately after she began publishing her entries, an online army of ultra-nationalists deluged Fang Fang, indignant that in airing doubts about the superiority of China's coronavirus containment she was betraying her motherland. That her diary could be published in English only months after the Wuhan lockdown was lifted, they hinted darkly, meant Fang Fang was deliberately aiding Western countries to smear China and to profit off the suffering of Wuhan. Berry says even he has received thousands of angry emails and death threats for simply translating her writing. One anonymous letter, allegedly written by a high school student, lambasted Fang Fang for airing China's dirty laundry out for everyone to see. "My child, I also want to tell you that when I was 16 years old, I was much worse off than you are. At that time, I had never even heard of words like 'independent thought,'" Fang Fang gently wrote back. China today is more globalized and more confident than ever. It has also become more hostile to foreign ideas, suspicious they are Western designs to stop China's rise, and has demonstrated its willingness to engage in bare-knuckles diplomacy. Voices like Fang Fang's — who remember well the brutal decade of the Cultural Revolution, when adolescent Maoists tortured, persecuted and beat to death the politically incorrect, as well as the subsequent prosperity of economic reform and opening— are increasingly rare in China. But in the context of larger conversations being had about China and its place in the world, American readers would do well to remember they exist. Emily Feng is NPR's Beijing correspondent.

             A patient with suspected COVID-19 arrives at Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn in early April. Even as the risk of big medical bills climbs, many Americans are losing their jobs and health insurance right now. If there's a time that people particularly need access to good health care and health insurance, it's during a global pandemic. But in the U.S. 33.5 million people so far have had to file for unemployment benefits — and most people in the nation get their health insurance through their jobs. An analysis from the Kaiser Family Foundation published Wednesday estimates that 27 million people have recently lost their health coverage. The bit of good news is that the report also found that the vast majority of those who lost their insurance can remain covered by switching to a spouse's plan, or are eligible to get subsidized health insurance elsewhere — either via Medicaid or via a plan on the Obamacare insurance exchanges. "To me that the takeaway from this report is that the Affordable Care Act is serving as the safety net it was intended to be," says Sabrina Corlette, co-director of the Center on Health Insurance Reforms at Georgetown University. "Of course, the ultimate irony is it's performing this function at a time when the Trump administration is arguing before the Supreme Court that it should be struck down." The question now is how many people who have lost their coverage will actually enroll in a new plan. Health insurance is complicated, and signing up can be hard. "There are a lot of stressors on people right now," says Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation and an author of the report. "You may be unemployed, you might be sick, you might be quarantining — and there's just a limit to how many life things you can deal with at once." Still, the clock is ticking. If you've lost coverage because of a job loss, that's what's called a "qualifying life event." You can go to Healthcare.Gov or your state's insurance exchange right now to enroll in a new plan. But that needs to happen within 60 days of losing coverage — and especially for people who lost their employer-based insurance in early March, there's no time to lose. Here is a guide to a few of the options available to you if you're one of the millions who've recently lost your job and your health insurance: I got laid off and had insurance through my job You might be able to keep the same health plan under federal rules known as COBRA — if you worked for an employer with 20 employees or more. Levitt says one advantage of COBRA is "it provides the most continuity of coverage, because you stay in exactly the same plan you were in when you were employed — same network of doctors and hospitals, same deductible — everything is identical." But this continuation of your current health coverage can be quite expensive because, at least under normal circumstances, you would have to pay the full monthly premium, without your employer chipping in to make it more affordable. Your insurer is required to notify you if you have the COBRA option, and you have 60 days to elect to take it. (For those who lost coverage in March, the clock is ticking to elect this option). The next place to look is the insurance exchanges set up under the Affordable Care Act. Losing health insurance that you got through your job is considered a "qualifying event" to enroll in a plan on all the health insurance exchanges. That means you can go to Healthcare.gov or your state-run exchange and shop for a new plan. The Kaiser Family Foundation has a handy subsidy calculator so you can see what you might pay in premiums for these plans — remember that your unemployment benefits count as income on the exchanges. Again, you only have 60 days to choose this option after losing coverage (unless you live in a state that's created a special enrollment period), so be sure and enroll in that time window. If your income has been wiped out with the lost job, you should also check to see whether you qualify for Medicaid, the national health insurance program for low-income people that's jointly funded by federal and state governments. Medicaid enrollment takes place year-round and is based on monthly income, not annual income, and it's essentially free for people who are eligible. You're more likely to qualify if you live in one of the 37 states and D.C. that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. I was already uninsured Your options to get covered if you're one of roughly 28 million Americans who were uninsured even before the COVID-19 crisis depend on where you live. Medicaid may work for you, but the rules for eligibility (including the income cut-off) vary by state. States that have not expanded Medicaid — which is how Obamacare broadened coverage to 12 million previously uninsured people — have more restrictive rules about who qualifies. According to the Kaiser foundation, nearly 6 million adults already qualified for Medicaid before COVID-19 but were not enrolled. If you don't qualify for Medicaid, next look to the state insurance exchanges that were set up under the ACA. The Trump administration has decided not to open a special enrollment period for Healthcare.gov, the federal insurance exchange. But some states run their own insurance marketplaces and have created a special enrollment period during the coronavirus crisis. In these states — including hard-hit places like California and New York — that means you don't need to have a "qualifying event" like job-based coverage loss or the birth of a child to newly enroll right now in an Obamacare plan. It's worth checking to see whether you can enroll and get an affordable plan — according to KFF, more than 4 million people who were uninsured before the coronavirus crisis would have qualified for a subsidized ACA health plan that would cost them nothing in monthly insurance premiums. One thing to note is that Congress has put funding in some of its emergency funding bills that may help hospitals and health systems pay for COVID-19 care for the uninsured. "While people who are uninsured might still receive bills from providers, [these federal funds] will help reduce the burden on patients because the hospitals will be compensated at least partially for their costs," says Corlette of Georgetown University. White House officials have pointed to this funding as a reason why a federal special enrollment period may not be necessary. Uninsured patients' bills related to COVID-19 might be forgiven by doctors and hospitals, the White House suggests. Many details about how that federal funding will be dispersed are still up in the air, and it's limited to care and testing related to the coronavirus. "While COVID-19 is a very present risk right now in a lot of people's minds, people have health care needs that go beyond the coronavirus." notes Levitt. If you end up with cancer, for instance, or a burst appendix and you're uninsured, that could be financially ruinous, which is why health policy experts always recommend getting covered if you can. My kids have lost their coverage, too There will be many people — more than 5 million — who won't have access to insurance they can afford, even with the options mentioned above. If you can't get a health plan for the adults in your family, your children might still be able to get coverage — the rules are different for them, as well as for pregnant women. InsureKidsNow.gov is a good place to start to determine if your children may be eligible. What about short-term or "skinny" plans? Short-term health insurance plans were originally designed to be used for just several months — to tide people over between the end of schooling and the start of a new job, for instance. Since then, the Trump administration has promoted these plans, and their more affordable monthly premiums, as good long-term alternatives. But the plans often have more limitations in what they cover than ACA plans do. They're allowed to restrict enrollment to those without preexisting conditions, for example, and don't have to cover all "essential benefits" included in all Obamacare plans. "They might exclude prescription drugs; they might cap how much they'll pay in a hospital," says Levitt. "So if you look at one of these short-term plans, you really want to read the fine print carefully." Once I'm insured, what's covered in the time of coronavirus? Congress has required that the cost of coronavirus testing be covered by insurers (though testing is still not always available). What's less clear is how much your treatment will cost you if you get seriously ill and need to be hospitalized for COVID-19. Hospital and emergency care are considered essential benefits and must be covered, but patients may still have to meet the annual deductible of their policy and pay things like copays and coinsurance on top of that. Some large commercial insurers have pledged to waive these patient costs for COVID-19 treatment, and several nonprofit community health plans have as well. The limited availability of diagnostic testing may make it tricky to prove you qualify for these benefits, Levitt points out. Unfortunately, surprise bills are still a concern — those are bills that come directly from out-of-network hospitals or doctors who provide your care. Nearly 1 in 5 inpatient admissions for pneumonia results in a surprise bill, according to a KFF analysis. It's possible members of Congress will try to address this in future coronavirus legislation, but until they do, this will remain a way that people could be exposed to high medical bills. If you do get a surprise bill from COVID-19 treatment, the same advice applies as always (this will be familiar to those who follow NPR's Bill of the Month series): Call your hospital or doctor and/or insurance company, and try to negotiate a lower bill. If they won't budge, check with the doctor or hospital to see if they can help you with a payment plan, or forgive the debt, as a part of a charity care program.

             A customer looks at trucks Friday at a Toyota dealership in El Monte, Calif. Car sales have been recovering for several weeks despite the continuing coronavirus outbreak. Unemployment is mounting. The economy keeps falling deeper into a recession — or worse. The coronavirus continues to spread. But car sales surprisingly are climbing.  Auto sales tanked in March — to 80% below their expected levels. And they remain well below normal. But while much of the economy continues its free fall, car sales have been on the rise for six straight weeks, according to data from J.D. Power, a marketing data and analytics company.  The steady improvement is fueled, in part, by big incentives for customers who can afford to buy. Dealers are promoting 0% loans for as long as seven years. That's remarkable, says Jessica Caldwell, the head of industry analysis at Edmunds, an automotive information company.  "To be honest, I've never really seen incentives like these," she says. And consumers are paying attention. In April, no-interest loans accounted for a remarkable 26% of new car sales, she says. "Auto companies are really faced with the challenge of pulling out all the stops to try to capture the small market that is actually willing to buy cars — because we know that it's not a large one right now," she says. That market is smaller, of course, because the ongoing economic crisis has many would-be buyers either unable to afford a new car or understandably reluctant to make a big-ticket purchase given the economic risks they face. Nina Erlich-Williams of Corvallis, Ore., has been thinking of buying a new car for a while. Her family's 2007 Honda Pilot is both a gas guzzler and "a bit of a money pit," she says.  She'd like to get a plug-in hybrid, for environmental reasons, and has been saving up for a down payment. But with the coronavirus crisis, she and her husband feel that it's wiser to hang on to that cash for now. They run a small public relations firm that works with nonprofits, and are expecting a lot of lost business in the months ahead. "I think right now we're just sort of in suspended animation as we wait to see what happens with the economy," Erlich-Williams says.  On the other hand, those huge promotions are clearly pulling some buyers in despite the economic uncertainty.  Avery Hoppa of Hanover, N.H., got an email from her local Volkswagen dealership advertising 0% annual percentage rate for 72 months and no payments for six months.  Her family's income has not been reduced by the pandemic; Hoppa's a nurse, and her husband's a professor. They'd been thinking about buying a bigger vehicle for a while but put it off when they had to fix their leaky roof. Besides, their VW Golf SportWagen drove just fine.  Then came that dealership email, and in less than two hours, they'd decided they couldn't say no to that deal.   "My husband and I were like, 'This is it! This is the moment we were waiting for,' " she says. After negotiating by phone and email, followed by a social distancing trip to the dealership, Hoppa's family now owns a three-row Tiguan. Someday, it'll cart around carpooling kids and visiting grandparents. For now? "Well, it's doing a lot of sitting in our driveway," Hoppa says.  Like a lot of us, that SUV isn't going anywhere.  And eye-popping incentives on new cars might be sticking around for a while, too, if the economy continues to be stuck in suspended animation.

         When the Dan Hotel in Jerusalem was leased by the government to house recovering COVID-19 patients, the new guests gave it the nickname, "Hotel Corona." The nearly 200 patients inside already had the coronavirus; and so, unlike the outside world on strict lockdown, they could give each other high fives and hugs and hang out together.  What was even more surprising than what they could do was what they were doing. Patients from all walks of life - Israelis, Palestinians, religious, secular, groups that don't normally mix - were getting along and having fun. They were eating together, sharing jokes, even doing Zumba. And because they were documenting themselves on social media, the whole country was tuning in to watch, like a real life reality TV show.  Join Rough Translation as we follow an Israeli comedian, a Bedouin hospital worker and a hotel manager in Hotel Corona, asking is this unlikely togetherness a one-off? Or a new reality?

             An N95 respirator — a critical piece of personal protective equipment. The U.S. is now restricting the ability of aid groups abroad to use American funds to buy PPE. When it comes to fighting COVID-19 abroad, the U.S. has been the most generous nation in the world, committing $900 million to global health, humanitarian and economic programs in 120 countries, according to the State Department. The money goes to international and local aid groups and health facilities in country. But there's a catch.  Aid recipients can't use U.S. funds to buy personal protective equipment for health workers — masks and gloves, for example — without prior approval from the U.S. Agency for International Development. The restriction, first reported by The New Humanitarian on April 29, has drawn criticism from global aid groups that rely on U.S. funds to do life-saving work in the developing world and in countries struggling with the pandemic.  "It just sets up an additional obstacle for implementing partners who also need to be mindful and protect their staff during an already challenging time," says Amanda Glassman, executive director of the Center for Global Development, a think tank.    USAID answered questions about the restriction in an email to NPR and then a follow-up phone interview. USAID requested that the comments be attributed to "a USAID spokesperson." The measure was put in place to ensure there would be enough PPE for the U.S., the spokesperson told NPR. In the email response, the spokesperson noted: "We continue to remain sensitive to the needs of humanitarian beneficiaries around the world while balancing the urgency of the domestic requirements here in the United States." It's part of a series of government efforts to save PPE stocks for the U.S. In a press briefing on April 7, Secretary of State Michael Pompeo said the U.S. would no longer be shipping PPE outside the country. That represented a shift in policy. In February, for example, the U.S. sent 17.8 tons of donated medical supplies, including masks and gowns, to China.  "Right now, given the great need for PPE in our own country, our focus will be on keeping critical medical items in the United States until demand is met here," said Pompeo in the briefing.   Indeed, U.S. health workers remain in need of PPE. In mid-April, the American Medical Association sent a letter urging the Federal Emergency Management Agency to address "rampant" PPE shortages in the U.S. "Physicians and other health-care workers in every state have expressed serious concerns regarding the availability of appropriate safety equipment," the letter stated.  In the May 8 phone interview with NPR, the USAID spokesperson said the agency recently began telling aid recipients that they could not use their funds to purchase PPE. This restriction was communicated to the groups via their USAID contact person or included in their grant agreement.  If aid recipients would like to use their COVID-19 funds to purchase PPE, they must submit a request to USAID, according to the USAID spokesperson.  Lisa Hilmi, executive director of Core Group, a global consortium of 9,000 community health organizations, says she has been in regular communications with aid groups around the world. The groups she works told her that they began learning of this new guideline the week of April 20.  According to Hilmi, the groups were informed by their USAID liaisons that they cannot use existing aid funds to buy PPE. In bids for new USAID funding, they must specify that they would like to use the funds to purchase PPE — and get approval from the agency to do so.  After being informed of the need to ask for permission to purchase PPE, says Hilmi, "hundreds of groups filled out this request. But so far, none have heard back from USAID."  Last week, Hilmi says she asked a USAID contact for an update — but "they said they were not aware of what the timeline and process was [to approve the requests]."    Hilmi says she is "frustrated" by the delay in response from the agency to requests for PPE purchase. "During a pandemic, we expect things to be more nimble," she says. "People's lives are at stake."   NPR asked USAID to comment on the reports of delays in responses regarding the purchase of PPE. USAID did not provide an answer, telling NPR they could not give a reply in time for publication. Asked whether it is understandable that with shortages in the U.S. of PPE, the U.S. might put priority on establishing its own supply, Glassman of the Center for Global Development replied, "As the wealthiest country on the planet, surely we can do both with a bit of effort."  Aid organizations contacted by NPR that receive U.S. funding have also expressed frustration with the restriction. "It is unacceptable that USAID restricts Partners In Health and NGOs [nongovernmental organizations] like us from purchasing these items with their funds. We are one global community and must fight this disease as one global community. We are not safe until we are all safe," said Cate Oswald, chief policy and partnership officer for the global health group Partners In Health. In a statement from Save the Children to NPR, Bernice Romero, senior director of humanitarian policy and advocacy, wrote: "Save the Children is aware of the new guidance and is extremely concerned ... We are urging the U.S. government to make provisions to allow us to procure the protective equipment we need in order to reach vulnerable children and families and protect our staff during this crisis."   Meanwhile, USAID, in public statements, has emphasized the importance of other kinds of pandemic strategies.  In response to a question at a press briefing on May 1, USAID acting administrator John Barsa noted that the COVID response extends beyond medical supplies such as PPE and ventilators. "There's many things in our toolkit to fight the pandemic. So it is more than just equipment," he said. He noted that the U.S. aid can be used for other efforts, such as raising awareness about COVID-19, boosting access to water and sanitation and improving disease surveillance.  But at least one piece of critical COVID-19 equipment is now being sent by the U.S.  On May 8, Barsa tweeted that the agency sent ventilators to South Africa. "This equipment will be used in South African intensive care units & will in no way impact the availability of these critical supplies for the American people," he wrote.

             Uber Eats is in talks with Grubhub about a possible acquisition. Analysts say such a merger would make the combined company the dominant player in food delivery. With its ride-hailing business devastated by the coronavirus pandemic, Uber is in talks to acquire online food delivery company Grubhub. If the two sides can reach a deal, the combined company would emerge as the dominant food-delivery app with 55% of the U.S. market, according to analyst Dan Ives with Wedbush Securities. "Clearly this would be an aggressive move by Uber to take out a major competitor on the Uber Eats front and further consolidate its market share position, especially as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to shift more of a focus to deliveries versus ride-sharing in the near term," Ives wrote in a note to investors. With so many people unwilling or unable to go out to restaurants because of the coronavirus pandemic, demand for food delivery has surged. Competition among the various apps, including DoorDash and Postmates, has intensified. Despite a spike in orders, none of the top food-delivery apps are turning a profit. That has caused discussion about mergers to swirl for some time. The pandemic has sped up those deliberations, says analyst Tom White with D.A. Davidson. "We've long believed that consolidation in online food delivery is inevitable," he wrote in an email to NPR. White predicts food-delivery apps will remain popular even after the economy gets moving again. In March — the most recent month for which data is available — DoorDash was the most popular meal-delivery service, with some 42% of all U.S. sales in the category, according to analytics firm Second Measure. It was trailed by Grubhub with 28% and Uber Eats with 20%. Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi told investors during an earnings call last week that as its ride-hailing business has nose-dived, enlisting drivers to deliver food to doorsteps may become a larger part of the company's future. "The big opportunity we thought Eats was just got bigger," Khosrowshahi said. He argued that a merged food-delivery company could be a boon for both restaurants and diners. "There is a bunch of consolidation happening on a global basis where bigger players can not only provide better service for restaurants and consumers, but can provide a better service kind of on an economic basis that is sustainable," Khosrowshahi said. But the merger chatter comes as cities across the country are cracking down on food-delivery apps by capping the fees they can charge per order. Some restaurant owners say the fees, which can range from 10% to 40% of the total bill, hurt their bottom lines at a time when the industry is struggling to survive. Companies like Grubhub counter that they are widening restaurants' customer bases and that the higher-end fees reflect the additional marketing services that they provide to restaurant owners who choose it. Food delivery apps also contend it would be more costly for restaurants to develop their own technology and pay for their own drivers to deliver meals. A deal between Uber and Grubhub may run into problems with federal regulators. Analyst White said antitrust regulators may inspect the potential merger closely given the impact it could have on the restaurant sector at a time of deep peril for the industry. U.S. Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., who chairs the House's antitrust subcommittee, has come out in opposition of a deal. In a statement, he characterized the potential merger in starkly critical terms. "Uber is a notoriously predatory company that has long denied its drivers a living wage," Cicilline said. "Its attempt to acquire Grubhub — which has a history of exploiting local restaurants through deceptive tactics and extortionate fees — marks a new low in pandemic profiteering."

             Public health authorities say they hope smartphone apps can boost contact tracing efforts, but there are debates over how much data officials need to collect. When Vern Dosch heard that Apple and Google had teamed up to develop smartphone technology to help curb the spread of the coronavirus, he was excited. Dosch leads North Dakota's contact tracing strategy. He believed the tech giants' move would amplify his state's efforts to identify people who may have been exposed to the virus — a critical step as states reopen for business.  In addition to hiring hundreds of contact tracers to call people with COVID-19 to learn where they've been and whom they've been with, North Dakota has built its own smartphone app for people to download. Dosch thought Google and Apple's system, which relies on the standard Bluetooth technology in most phones, would make that app more powerful. But the terms the tech companies have set to protect smartphone users' privacy are getting in the way.  Now Dosch faces a dilemma. "Do we try to do this on our own?" he asked. "Or do we just bow to the demands of Apple and Google?" If North Dakota follows the companies' rules, it would have to build a new app. If the state opts out of the tech giants' system, it won't be able to reach as many smartphone users who may be at risk of the virus.   "We need to have every tool" Dosch, a veteran of the information technology industry, retired in January, only to be tapped weeks later by North Dakota's government to head up its contact tracing effort. Among the projects he is overseeing is Care19, an app that tracks a phone's location using GPS. More than 30,000 people in the state have already downloaded it. Dosch said he hopes more will do so, enabling officials to keep tabs on potential coronavirus hot spots as the state lifts restrictions. "We want to know if, all of a sudden, contact tracing identifies that we've had a lot of positives at a particular grocery store or a bar," he said. In addition to knowing where people with the virus have been, North Dakota also wants to know whom they've come close to, so those people can be notified and get tested.  "We feel that in order to do our very best to protect the citizens and to do ... a very thorough job of contact tracing, we need to have every tool that we can," Dosch said. That's where Apple and Google's new system could help. The two are setting aside their normal rivalry to develop technology that will work across 3 billion iPhones and Androids around the world. But there is a catch: The tech giants say governments that use their technology cannot track users' locations. In their view, letting GPS report your every movement to the government is too big an invasion of privacy. Other people working on digital contact tracing share the companies' caution. Daniel Weitzner, a research scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is working on a Bluetooth-based project similar to Apple and Google's. While he is not working directly with Apple and Google, he said he understands why the companies are taking this stand.  "Given the uncertainty about what is going to be effective here, we felt that the right thing to do ... was to start with the least intrusive approach that had a chance of being effective," Weitzner said. For the technology to work as intended, people have to feel comfortable downloading and using it. But an April poll by Pew Research Center shows Americans are split, with just over half saying it would be "at least somewhat acceptable" for the government to use cellphone-tracking information to find out where people with COVID-19 had been. The same survey found 6 in 10 people doubted location-tracking information would help fight the spread of the virus.  A global question with global urgency The debate extends beyond North Dakota. South Dakota is also using the Care19 app, while Utah has an app that tracks location as well as the identities of users. Other states have told NPR that they are considering using apps to help with contact tracing, but they have not yet made a final decision.  Jared Allgood, co-founder of Twenty, the startup that built Utah's app, said Apple and Google's decision to bar location-data collection is "disappointing." He said he hopes to reach some kind of agreement with the tech giants to use their system in Utah. But he said tracking location and identity remain key to the state's contact-tracing plan. "For [contact tracers] to do their job, they have to identify who that person is so that they can pick up the phone, have the conversation and encourage them to take the steps that they want them to take so that they can stop spreading the disease," he said. "We're trying to balance that ... with the need to protect user privacy." In Europe, governments are split. Germany and Italy said they will use the Apple-Google system, while Norway and the United Kingdom are building their own apps. Back in North Dakota, Dosch said the state may build a second app that detects proximity in line with the tech companies' rules. But he said, "I don't know that too many citizens are going to be interested in doing both apps." He said the state will decide in the next few weeks. "There's an urgency on our part, as the economy opens back up, to make sure we keep on top of this, so that we don't end up with a surge that was bigger than the first one," he said. "This technology is a part of that." Contact tracing "relies on trust" Traditional contact tracing is laborious. Health workers spend hours on the phone with infected people, going over where they have been and whom they have seen, attempting to track the spread of the disease. Technology could supercharge those efforts. But experts caution that it is not a silver bullet. Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said it is not clear yet whether any of these apps will be useful to contact tracers. "[They] might actually give you a much larger haystack to sort through in order to find your needle," she said. Contact tracing has always fundamentally been about human interaction — public health staff asking people to open up about their personal lives. "It really relies on trust and it relies on the person being interviewed being willing to divulge that information to a public health official," Nuzzo said. No app — regardless of the data it collects — can do the same.  Editor's note: Apple and Google are among NPR's financial supporters. NPR's Selena Simmons-Duffin contributed to this report.

             A COVID-19 testing operation stays busy in Boyle Heights, Calif. Daily case counts overall may be on the low side because access to testing is limited in some parts of the world. The U.S. has the most coronavirus deaths of any country in the world — on May 11, the death toll passed 80,000. And that's likely an undercount.  "Almost certainly it's higher," said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, at a virtual Senate hearing on Tuesday. "There may have been people who died at home who were not counted as COVID because they never really got to the hospital."  It's not just the death toll that's likely higher. Medical statisticians say we have been undercounting cases since the pandemic started — not only in the U.S. but also around the world. That's because in countries rich and poor and in between, people who contract COVID-19 are not necessarily diagnosed — because of the shortage of tests and the difficulty of getting tested in some parts of the world, especially remote spots.  So you should keep in mind certain caveats as you consider the endless stream of numbers. Here's what we know about some of the most frequently discussed data points. Total confirmed cases What we want this to tell us: How many people have had COVID-19. What it actually tells us: How many people have tested positive for the live virus (the most common way of being diagnosed) or, in some cases, been diagnosed based on symptoms. The actual number of people who have had COVID-19 is probably higher.  Caveats: Daily case counts What we want this to tell us: Is the number of new cases of COVID-19 rising or falling over time? What it tells us: How many cases are reported on each day and how that number compares with previous days. Only in areas where large numbers of people are tested regularly could the curve of daily case counts be considered a reliable marker of spread or containment. Caveats: Total deaths What we want this to tell us: How many people have died from COVID-19 from the start of the outbreak until now. What it tells us: How many people have died with the official cause of death listed as "COVID-19" — excluding those who died of the disease but were not identified as COVID-19 casualties. These numbers generally represent a conservative count of deaths and will likely be revised upward on review. But they are probably more accurate than case counts. "The [under]reporting issue for death numbers is less severe than case numbers, but it still exists," says Sen Pei, a public health research scientist at Columbia University.  Caveats:  Death rate for coronavirus patients What we want this to tell us: How likely are people who get COVID-19 to die from it? What it tells us: The total number of reported deaths divided by the total number of confirmed cases — both of which could be undercounts.  Caveats: Recovery rate for coronavirus patients What we want this to tell us: How many people who have contracted COVID-19 recover. What it tells us: How many people who have been officially diagnosed with COVID-19 have kicked the virus. Caveats:

             Hassidic Jews Socially distancing on a Willamsburg street during Saturday morning shabbat prayers on May 2. American Jews are finding themselves in a historically familiar position: Scapegoated for a plague.  Some of the first New Yorkers to contract the coronavirus were Jews in the Orthodox Jewish communities in and around New York City. In the weeks that followed, several Jewish weddings and funerals were held in violation of public health orders. Then came statements from public officials singling out Jews, and anti-Semitic threats on Facebook.  After New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio witnessed the NYPD break up a large funeral in Brooklyn for a prominent rabbi, the mayor tweeted: "My message to the Jewish community, and all communities, is this simple: the time for warnings has passed."  De Blasio was condemned by fellow Democrats and American Jews. There is no data indicating religious Jews are violating social distancing rules at a greater rate than other demographic groups. While there have been high-profile incidents of police disrupting Jewish gatherings, the NYPD has also made arrests of various sorts for failing to practice social distancing, like at a Brooklyn barbershop and at a Manhattan "marijuana party." And pictures of throngs hanging out at parks and closely congregating for the Navy Blue Angels and Air Force Thunderbirds flyovers indicated that not social distancing isn't a problem specific to a particular religious group.  De Blasio later said that he "spoke out of real distress that people's lives were in danger." He added: "I regret if the way I said it in any way gave people a feeling of being treated the wrong way, that was not my intention. It was said with love but it was tough love, it was anger and frustration." My message to the Jewish community, and all communities, is this simple: the time for warnings has passed. I have instructed the NYPD to proceed immediately to summons or even arrest those who gather in large groups. This is about stopping this disease and saving lives. Period. By some accounts, religious Jews in certain neighborhoods of New York City have been stricken by the virus at high rates. At the same time, Jews who have recovered from the virus have donated plasma in extraordinary numbers in an effort to save others.  In early March, Yaacov Behrman, a community leader and Hasidic Jewish activist, rushed to get ahead of the virus by marrying his bride, Shevi Katzman, after an engagement of just a week-and-a-half. They had a socially distanced wedding across two Brooklyn backyards — with a few siblings, no cousins, two witnesses and a rabbi, and 2,500 people watching on Facebook Live.  "I think that's what's so painful and upsetting about it, about the mayor's tweet, [is] the vast majority of Orthodox Jews have given up [something] — I gave up a wedding," Behrman said. "What are you generalizing for, Mr. Mayor? It's like going to the park and saying, 'My message to the yuppies,' you know?" Behrman said he does not believe the mayor is anti-Semitic, but Jews should not have been singled out.  "The organizers of the funeral [de Blasio tweeted about] were 100% wrong — it was an embarrassment, it was an embarrassment to me as an Orthodox Jew, it was an embarrassment to me as a New Yorker," he said. "But I also want to make it clear, you look around New York, everyone is becoming lax unfortunately." Yet there's a pattern of specifically highlighting Jewish offenders. In Lakewood, N.J., where early on in the pandemic police made arrests at large Jewish gatherings, a local news station reported that a school bus was carrying children to a Jewish school that was open, illegally. The reporter later acknowledged that the bus was just delivering food to homebound families.  In nearby Jackson Township, N.J., town council president Barry Calogero made a speech at a government meeting indicating that Judaism itself made Jews recalcitrant when it comes to following the rules.  "Unfortunately, there are groups of people who hide behind cultures or religious beliefs and put themselves, our first responders, and quite honestly all of Jackson and bordering towns at risk for their selfishness, irresponsibility and inability to follow the law put in place by President Trump and Governor Murphy," he said.  Calogero said he was not anti-Semitic. But after criticism he resigned days later, citing health reasons. And in Rockland County, N.Y., where there are large communities of Orthodox Jews, the county executive's Facebook post about police breaking up a large Passover service was met by anti-Semitic comments. Violations of health regulations by Orthodox Jews have been documented by public officials and media at a level of scrutiny that Jews say others don't face. Eli Steinberg, an Orthodox Jewish writer in Lakewood, N.J., says it's easier to generalize about those who wear traditional garb.  "We're, ya know, we're the guys dressed in black and white and we wear the hats, so it becomes a sort of more interesting story" when Jews violate health rules, he said. "But it's not — it's a story about people....People do dumb stuff."  The problem, he said, is when it is made to seem as though the few who violate the rules are more widespread in a particular community.  "In a time of such uncertainty, which we're going through now, when you can effectively scapegoat somebody or scapegoat a group of people about the issue that people are scared of...that's a part of it that concerns me," Steinberg said. "This moment where there's the vehicle of Covid19 to use to spread hate, it just becomes that much more scary."    
                Hundreds of mourners gather in Brooklyn on April 28, to observe a funeral for Rabbi Chaim Mertz, a Hasidic Orthodox leader whose death was reportedly tied to the coronavirus. Mayor Bill de Blasio chastised "the Jewish community" following the breakup of the large funeral that flouted public health orders.

             Hundreds of mourners gather in Brooklyn on April 28, to observe a funeral for Rabbi Chaim Mertz, a Hasidic Orthodox leader whose death was reportedly tied to the coronavirus. Mayor Bill de Blasio chastised "the Jewish community" following the breakup of the large funeral that flouted public health orders. Bari Weiss, author of How To Fight Anti-Semitism and a New York Times opinion staff writer and editor, said given how anti-Semitism is at historic peaks in New York and around the country, public officials need to be "extremely specific" in criticizing large gatherings, instead of blaming "the Jewish community."  "I think that there is a double standard often when it comes to the way that the Jewish community and Jews are talked about, whether it's because we're not perceived as a minority, even though we are," she said. "It stands to reason that lots of people who already perhaps have animosity toward that community will be even more emboldened. The Anti-Defamation League released a report this week showing that there were more anti-Semitic incidents in 2019 than at any year since it it began tracking in 1979.  "Anyone that's been paying attention, or anyone that knows people inside of these communities, knows already dozens of stories of people that have been spit on, assaulted, harassed, had their head coverings pulled off, had their face smashed with a paving stone," Weiss said.  Now, amid the coronavirus, the hate is more socially distanced — happening largely online. Last month the ADL documented how community Facebook groups are loaded with comments blaming Jews for spreading the virus, and calling for them to be firehosed, tear-gassed and denied medical care.  Already a New Jersey man was arrested for using Facebook to threaten to assault Lakewood's Jews for spreading the virus. He was charged with making terrorist threats during a state of emergency. A county deputy fire marshall in New Jersey was investigated for similar Facebook comments. And in Queens, a couple was charged with hate crimes after attacking a group of Orthodox Jews — ripping their masks off and punching them in the face — for supposedly not social distancing. "You Jews are all getting us sick," the couple allegedly yelled.  This is all too familiar to Jews, Weiss says. For centuries Jews have been massacred for supposedly spreading plagues. Rats brought the black death to the European continent in the 1300s, "but rats weren't blamed. Jews were blamed." Thousands were slaughtered; entire communities were eliminated.   Jews today do not believe that violence at such a scale is imminent. But they remember their history.  "I think Jewish memory is always a gift, but it's especially a gift in a moment of crisis because frankly, we Jews have lived through a tremendous amount in our  centuries on this Earth," Weiss said. "And whenever we ask could it get worse, we know the answer is yes, because we've lived through worse, or at least our ancestors have. So I think Jewish memory can help us be grateful and keep things in perspective."For millions of college students around the country, coronavirus lockdowns effectively canceled their hobbies and extracurriculars. But that's not the case for Madison Cragle, a graphic design major at the State University of New York at Canton. She's co-captain of her school's Super Smash Bros. Ultimate team — an esports team. That's right, varsity video games. "There's a joke going around that once the quarantine ends, everyone's going to be like a thousand times better because we have nothing else to do," Cragle says. Besides all the extra practice time, right now, Cragle's actually playing in a tournament alongside hundreds of her fellow students. The $20,000 prize pool will go to a SUNY student emergency aid fund, medical research, personal protective equipment and student scholarships. It's sponsored by Extreme Networks, a technology company that provides the technical infrastructure for varsity esports at Canton and other campuses around the country. "We want to reach out and continue to build community," says SUNY Chancellor Kristina Johnson. Over 400,000 SUNY students are now at home, and plans for returning to campuses are very much still in formation. In the meantime, Johnson saw an opportunity to bring students together virtually across SUNY's 64 campuses. "The motivation was to get the students engaged, and then to raise money for students impacted by the crisis, and to pull together. " There are three separate games being played in the tournament, each by their own leagues. Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is a descendant of Nintendo's beloved, 1980s vintage Mario Bros.; Fortnite is an immersive "battle royale," and Rocket League is succinctly described by SUNY Canton sophomore Alec Knowles as "car soccer." Knowles, who hopped on a Zoom call along with Cragle to speak with NPR, is a "shoutcaster" for the tournament, meaning he provides play-by-play commentary over a livestream of the game. It takes a lot of time, he says: First, playing the game enough to learn the particulars so you can describe all the moves to fans. And then, the technical details. "We do all of our own streaming on Twitch," a platform for livestreaming of all kinds of activities, from video gaming to DJ sets. "So you have to put in the time to be able to set the stream up. Make sure that everything looks great, like the video and the pixels. ... So we don't have any issues where, like, it's lagging." Cragle says that while confined to home, the tournament's been a good social outlet. "I haven't really had much to do at home. I was gonna get a job but when the quarantine happened, I couldn't get the job I was gonna get." Now, she says, students from different campuses all over the state are connecting on special chat rooms set up on a site, called Discord, especially for tournament competitors. And there's a matchmaking function, so you can challenge people to side games. I ask if there's much trash talking on the Discord server, and Knowles chimes in: "Smash [Bros.] is the epicenter of salt [trash talk.]" Cragle laughs: "Yeah, if you watch the top players, they're so mean to each other sometimes. It makes for some good entertainment though, to be honest." Video game playing overall was up a reported 75% in the first week of U.S. coronavirus lockdowns, and streaming — live spectating of game play on platforms like Twitch — was up as well. Cragle and Knowles are hoping that the tournament helps win over new fans. "Transitioning into college, like my parents were like, yeah, I don't know if you can actually make a career off this," says Knowles. "So I did it. And my parents are really supportive of me now."

             I wake up as my city falls asleep. Everything feels upside down. I left the U.S. for home in a blur two months ago. It stayed that way — gauzy and unfamiliar — for weeks. In March, as the spread of the coronavirus threatened global travel, I booked a flight from Washington, D.C., my temporary home for the last two months, so that I could hunker down with my parents, my 15-year-old sister and my grandmother. I scrambled to shove four years of my college life into three bags and flew more than 8,000 miles. But when I finally greeted my family in the three-bedroom apartment I grew up in, there was little comfort.

             I stepped out of my room for a while after days. It smells like rain. And home. The world was in crisis mode, and I wanted to be a part of my family, but I had to isolate for two weeks in my childhood bedroom, still painted purple and pink. I could only leave my room to go to the bathroom and to shower. I was served meals on plates that piled on my dresser because no one else was allowed to touch them. I would sit on my bed and talk to my sister while she sat on a chair outside my room. I couldn't touch or hug anyone. These measures would keep us safe.

             I looked at old photos with my sister who sat near my bedroom doorway. Yet my bedroom, which was supposed to be a safe space throughout self-isolation, brought back memories and triggers of some of the darkest times of my life. When I was around 16, I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder. As a teenager, I spent hours feeling intensely small and sad in that room. Left alone there now at 22, at times I felt like I had never left. So I took photos as a way of processing the overwhelming. This series of 14 photographs explores the various emotions that 14 days of self-isolation brought.

             My view as I start my work day. Right as the sun sets. Isolation will make you think about the things that the chaos of life tunes out. Who am I when I'm alone? What would I be doing if I'd stayed in Washington? When will life feel normal again?  I was nervous about falling back into old patterns and coming to a standstill. I've worked at managing my anxiety and when I have a bad day, I can usually brush it off. In my bedroom, I would still get anxious and feel low, but the little things showed me the progress I've made: I could get myself to tidy up; I'd catch myself humming and listening to music; I was making art — things I couldn't do in this room when I was 16.

             I was first diagnosed with depression and anxiety while I spent a lot time in this room. I feel blue.

             Time is a lost concept in these four walls. For the series, I chose instax as my medium as they're instant, raw and real. I wanted to capture a feeling, see it develop and hold it, touch it and play with it. To fill the gaps in the photographic medium, I used leftover paints I've accumulated from when I was in elementary school to intentionally further the emotion the image expresses. I used paint to create images on failed exposures. I ran out of film and didn't have access to more because of the lockdown. I had to get creative with what I had — a metaphor for the time we're in.

                "The two most replicated, robust factors linked to suicide are economic change — downturn — and social disconnection," says Dr. Roger McIntyre, professor of psychiatry at the University of Toronto. And both factors, he notes, are major hallmarks of the COVID-19 pandemic.

             "The two most replicated, robust factors linked to suicide are economic change — downturn — and social disconnection," says Dr. Roger McIntyre, professor of psychiatry at the University of Toronto. And both factors, he notes, are major hallmarks of the COVID-19 pandemic. Mental health specialists are working now to bolster the resilience of Americans who are suffering from feelings of despair — in hopes of preventing increases in suicides among people who are under increased pressure during the coronavirus pandemic. Time is of the essence, public health researchers say. Experience with past natural disasters, such as earthquakes and hurricanes, shows that a rise in suicide often happens in the months after the immediate physical dangers of the disaster have passed. A report jointly published last week by two foundations that support mental health issues estimates that, unless steps are taken now, the increase in "deaths of despair" from alcohol, drugs and suicide could increase by 75,000 as a result of COVID-19. "Undeniably, policymakers must place a large focus on mitigating the effects of COVID," says Benjamin F. Miller, chief strategy officer of the Well Being Trust, which published the report in conjunction with the Robert Graham Center for Policy Studies in Family Medicine and Primary Care. "However, if the country continues to ignore the collateral damage — specifically our nation's mental health — we will not come out of this stronger." If You Need Help: Resources If you or someone you know is in crisis, help is available. Call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255, or go here to chat online. For more help: Fortunately, there are ways to mitigate those risks now, say psychologists and suicide survivors. For example, they urge elected leaders to make it easier for people who are suffering to get access to mental health care — whether or not they are employed. The National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention, for example, is now coordinating with other groups in a "National Response to COVID-19." The campaign, co-led by the head of the National Institute of Mental Health and former Rep. Patrick J. Kennedy, aims to better coordinate and publicize mental health resources for those who are particularly vulnerable right now. J, for example, is a 33-year-old wife, mother and social worker for whom mysterious illness is a trigger for suicidal thinking. A decade ago, a rare hormonal disease ravaged her body, and she spent years misdiagnosed. That experience nearly broke her emotionally, and she attempted suicide twice. The pandemic made that trauma vivid again when she came down with symptoms of COVID-19 but couldn't get access to testing or care. "We're in rural Montana, so there's basically one place I can go," says J. But it was Good Friday, so the clinic was closed, and she wasn't sure where to get tested. J was already laden with anxiety; she worried her hours as a social worker might be cut, leaving her counseling clients without help. (For professional reasons, J asked that NPR use only her first initial.) "I'm dealing with all these new stressors, and there it is: For the first time in years now, I'm feeling suicidal myself." J slept, letting the horrible, familiar feelings recede. She later reached out to friends — a formula that works for her. Eventually, she tested negative for the virus. But for many other people, the pandemic has changed some of their usual coping mechanisms. "The normal avenues of help aren't necessarily there," says Dese'Rae Stage, a Philadelphia writer, photographer and suicide-prevention activist. Stage is looking for a new therapist after hers stopped practicing recently but is finding that many aren't taking new patients. "It's already hard to find a therapist who does sliding scale payments or takes insurance," but the pandemic has made it even harder to find one, she says. So Stage and other survivors have other recommendations for people looking for help: Averting the public health crisis of increased suicide attempts is a big and complex challenge. The pandemic has touched off many risk factors all at once, including joblessness, addiction and profound isolation. Suicide experts have studied the effects of trauma, from hurricanes Katrina and Ike to the Great Recession, but this pandemic — with its global geographic and psychosocial reach — could be particularly sweeping, they say. "The two most replicated, robust factors linked to suicide are economic change — downturn — and social disconnection," says Dr. Roger McIntyre, professor of psychiatry at the University of Toronto. Those two factors are major hallmarks, he notes, of the COVID-19 pandemic. McIntyre and his team this week published online in the journal World Psychiatry their research estimate of how the current pandemic and its economic constraints could affect some people. "If, in fact, the unemployment rate is 10 to 20 percent, we came out at a staggering statistic of over 8,000 additional suicides over and above what would have been expected if COVID never came into our lives," McIntyre told NPR. And of course that rate had already been climbing in recent years. So prevention advocates are doubling down. But addressing suicide is no simple task — it has complex roots. During the housing crisis and Great Recession a dozen years ago, suicides spiked, for example, but not for a single reason, says Dr. Joshua Gordon, director of the National Institute of Mental Health. Though taking one's own life is often linked to depression or other mental illness, that's not always the case. In looking at data about suicide attempts from those days, Gordon says, "You can see that it's not just about the eviction. It's not just about the foreclosure. Most of them have a range of five to 10 other significant adverse events in their lives — many of them financial, but also personal and social — that raise one's risk." Whether you're grieving the recent loss of someone or dealing with difficulties at home, call someone and talk to that person about what you're feeling, Gordon and other mental health experts advise. Even small steps like texting someone you know can have a positive impact. Anja Burcak, who is 25 and lives in Mobile, Ala., says she has been able to manage her bipolar disorder through the pandemic by leaning on her online circle of friends. Many have survived suicide attempts themselves and are helping each other now. "People unite more," she says. "I know physically we literally cannot do that, but they might be calling people they haven't called in years."

             Elia Gonzalez, 25, stands with her children Jesiel, 5, Ansiel, 4 and Angellia, 6, at the entrance to their home in RÃ­o Piedras, San Juan, Puerto Rico. Since her partner lost his work, food stamps have not been enough to keep Gonzalez's family fed during the pandemic. It hadn't been easy, but before the pandemic Elia Gonzalez had always managed to keep her family fed by stretching her food stamps and her partner's modest income as a D.J. at bars around Puerto Rico's capital, San Juan. That changed in mid-March, when those bars closed and her daughter's school, where she'd gotten free breakfast and lunch, did too. By April 20, the kitchen cabinet was almost empty. Gonzalez and her partner, who is undocumented and does not qualify for unemployment, went four days without eating so they'd have enough food for the children until Gonzalez's next monthly food stamps benefit landed on her EBT card in early May. Still, by the end of April, all she had left for the children was rice with a little egg mixed in. Her sons, shy 4 and 5-year-olds, would ask for more. But her oldest, Angellia, a talkative, curly-haired kindergartener, tried to reassure her mother. "She said, 'Mamá, I'm still hungry'," Gonzalez said, "but she told me it was okay because she was big and could wait until I got more food. That hit me hard."

             A worker in Vega Alta, P.R. In March, the island's governor imposed strict lockdown measures to control the COVID-19 outbreak. The coronavirus emergency has worsened hunger nationally, with recent polling finding that one in five U.S. households can't afford enough to eat. But Puerto Rico's rates of food insecurity have been higher than that since long before the pandemic. The U.S. territory has a higher poverty rate than any state. A study by the Puerto Rico Institute of Statistics in 2015 found that 22 percent of adults reported skipping meals or eating smaller portions because they didn't have money for food. That was before the island's bankruptcy, a string of natural disasters, and now the coronavirus lockdown, which closed businesses but also the schools that provided two daily meals to a majority of Puerto Rico's schoolchildren. "And so it's not an exaggeration to say that hunger in Puerto Rico right now is probably much higher than it was in 2015," said José Caraballo-Cueto, an economist at the University of Puerto Rico's campus in the city of Cayey. He estimates that the pandemic has driven the island's unemployment rate to an astounding 46 percent. "And the average saving rate here is zero. So if you have a social crisis like this, people don't have that buffer during the lockdown."

             People waited to pick up meals for their children at a public school cafeteria in Vega Alta, P.R., on May 6. The island's governor initially refused to open the cafeterias, but public pressure changed her mind. In recent days, it's a fight over the shuttered school cafeterias that has brought the issue of hunger on the island – and specifically childhood hunger — into full view. Governor Wanda Vázquez earned early praise for taking aggressive steps to combat the coronavirus. But after closing schools on March 16, she refused to allow their cafeterias to continue providing free lunches to children, as they have in most communities in the U.S. The governor initially said she feared exposing cafeteria workers to the virus. Many of those workers are older women. But as the lockdown dragged on, as bureaucratic hurdles delayed the arrival of federal stimulus and unemployment payments, and as the local government struggled to process a surge in new food stamp applications, people's patience wore thin. On social media, stories circulated about people like Elia Gonzalez who had run out of food for their children. One mother, Genesis Montañez, wrote to her son's teacher that all she had for her kids was water. Parents and politicians demanded the cafeterias reopen. Cafeteria employees said that with proper protective equipment, they were willing to go back to work. Activists sued and announced a protest of cars winding through the streets of San Juan. 
                Cafeteria workers packed food to go on the first day school lunch rooms were allowed to open nearly two months after the start of Puerto Rico's lockdown.

             Cafeteria workers packed food to go on the first day school lunch rooms were allowed to open nearly two months after the start of Puerto Rico's lockdown. On April 29, the governor acquiesced, saying a limited number of cafeterias would be allowed to reopen the following week. The island's 78 mayors would coordinate delivery of the meals to children who needed them. "Public opinion really forced the government to reconsider its decision and reopen the lunch rooms," said Denise Santos, president of the Puerto Rico Food Bank. She said that after the schools closed, she was inundated with more requests for food for children than the food bank could meet. "Most Puerto Ricans live from paycheck to paycheck, so eight weeks without any income made the situation very urgent for a lot of families." The first 80 cafeterias opened on May 6, and it was a fitful start. Many mayors reported that the island's education department delivered far less food than they needed or had requested. Others, like the mayor of the coastal town of Loíza, postponed meal distributions until this week rather than risk having to turn children away.  
                In the the town of Vega Alta, workers prepared meals for 800 children. Mayors across the island have complained they aren't getting enough food for all the children who need it.

             In the the town of Vega Alta, workers prepared meals for 800 children. Mayors across the island have complained they aren't getting enough food for all the children who need it. On Monday, the island's education secretary, Eligio Hernández, said his department had opened another 28 cafeterias this week and was preparing nearly 64,000 lunches a day. He also said families in some rural towns could sign up to have nonperishable food mailed to their homes. Then, on Wednesday, he closed 32 school kitchens after saying 50 workers had tested positive for COVID-19 antibodies. Criticism of the government's food response has not subsided. "The government has only served 10 percent of children," said Giovanni Roberto, a prominent anti-hunger activist who runs a small network of community soup kitchens, known as comedores sociales. "Our demands are clear. Open all school cafeterias, and serve everyone who needs it." In recent weeks, Roberto has been leading the calls to open the cafeterias. His profile was raised further when he was arrested on April 30 while leading the caravan of cars making their way through the streets of San Juan in protest. He was charged with violating the governor's stay-at-home order, but the arrest, broadcast on television, was widely criticized as unjustified. A judge dismissed the charges.

             Giovanni Roberto leads a small network of community soup kitchens called comedores sociales. After he was arrested during an anti-hunger demonstration in late April, donations to the comedores surged. The ordeal endeared many people in Puerto Rico to Roberto's cause. The community kitchens he runs with volunteers became an important source of food after Hurricane Maria, when the local and federal government failed to get supplies to people frantic for them. Since then, the comedores sociales have operated on shoestring budgets. But Roberto's recent prominence demanding the government do more to help Puerto Rico's poor during the pandemic has attracted tens of thousands of dollars in donations. "We're improving our center to have a bigger warehouse," Roberto said. The main facility – a salvaged community center in the city of Caguas — has shifted to grocery giveaways rather than serving meals on site. "We've gotten a lot of support, so we've expanded from 200 weekly grocery deliveries to 700 this week." Still, Roberto said that was not enough, and hoped the judge overseeing a lawsuit that advocates filed on behalf of several mothers will force the government to open more school cafeterias. A hearing in the case is scheduled for Friday.

The community kitchens became an important source of food after Hurricane Maria, when the local and federal governments failed to get supplies to people frantic for them. During the pandemic, the comedores have been providing free groceries. Denise Santos, the food bank president, said the pandemic's economic fallout has elevated a conversation about hunger and poverty in Puerto Rico that politicians – and many citizens — prefer to avoid. "Our politicians talk as if we were a first class country, and although there have been some programs in our history that have improved the middle class, in reality we are very poor. We always have been," Santos said. "But if you look at our Facebook page for the food bank, people comment that in Puerto Rico there is no hunger because everybody receives food stamps. People are in denial, period." In the Río Piedras section of San Juan, Christel Galindez Garcia, a community leader, saw the hunger in her neighborhood start to balloon within days of the island's shutdown. "Older people, immigrants, mothers with children," Galindez said. She has been picking up thirty cooked meals a day from a church near her home and delivering them to people's houses. She visits different families every day. "Do you know when you know people are really in need?" she asked. "When you show up with a plate of food and they start to cry."

On May 6, she also brought cupcakes to the home of Elia Gonzalez, whose daughter Angellia turned six that day. One of the people Galindez visited last Wednesday was Elia Gonzalez, who said that the day before, she'd gone through the last of the rice and egg she had been feeding her three kids. "Right now I have nothing in the kitchen," Gonzalez said. "Nothing, nothing." Though some school cafeterias had distributed meals that day, she said none were close to her apartment, and she doesn't have a car. Her federal stimulus payment was nowhere in sight because the island's treasury secretary, charged with distributing that money on behalf of the federal government, has said that people receiving food assistance will be among the last to get it. "And we're the ones who need that help the most," Gonzalez said. On the bright side, her monthly food stamps had just arrived, and that would let her restock her kitchen. Without her partner's income, she said, she could buy enough food for two to three weeks. Wednesday was also her daughter Angellia's sixth birthday. Christel Galindez, the community leader, knew this, and during her food delivery run, she drove up to Gonzalez's front door playing the birthday song through her car's speakers. She used a P.A. system to summon Angellia outside. The little girl emerged with a big smile, and spun a little pirouette to the music. Galindez handed Gonzalez three to-go-containers of food and a box with three cupcakes, one for each of her children. Erika P. Rodríguez contributed reporting from San Juan, P.R.

             Rep. Jackie Speier, D-Calif., shown here on Capitol Hill in 2017, has called for the practice of members sleeping in their offices to end for good. Updated at 6:15 p.m. ET on May 19 For some members of Congress, an office on Capitol Hill is just, well, an office. But for others, it doubles as their apartment while they live and work in Washington, D.C.  It's a practice Rep. Jackie Speier, D-Calif., would like to see permanently banned.  "You know, they sleep on their couches, they then get up in the morning, sneak downstairs [to] the members' gym, shower, change their clothes, and come back up for work," she describes.  "Imagine if you said to a constituent coming into your office, 'Welcome, come into my bedroom.' Because for all intents and purposes, that's what, I mean, I don't know if I'd want to sit on anyone's couch," Speier chuckles.  She says members making their office a home away from home is troubling on several fronts, calling the practice an inappropriate use of taxpayer funds and something that can make staffers feel uncomfortable.  "During the height of the 'Me Too' movement in the House, there were stories about members in their pajamas talking to staff," Speier says. "It's abnormal to do that." Speier argues it's particularly important to end the practice now, out of a need for increased health and safety vigilance because of the coronavirus pandemic.  In a May 1 letter to the architect and the attending physician of the Capitol, Speier noted that about 30 construction workers and police officers at the Capitol had tested positive for the virus. Additional Hill staff have also tested positive.  She posited if members sleep in their offices, there could be a greater chance of exacerbating the public health risk among members, aides and janitorial staff.   Previous reports have estimated that up to 100 members of Congress — mostly Republicans — live in their offices while in D.C. The last House speaker, Paul Ryan, was one of them. North Carolina Republican Rep. Ted Budd does it now.  Elected in 2016, Budd says he invested right away in a Murphy bed, otherwise known as a wall bed or pulldown bed. "It has a Tempur-Pedic mattress and [is] very comfortable, but it's completely invisible during the day and just sleeps like normal," he describes.  Budd says his main motivation behind the decision was to keep life simple. "When I came in as a freshman and people were trying to figure out places to live ... I was off to the races and working on great committee work right out of the gate," he says. "And so I skipped all of the normal ramp-up time of starting up a new place to live and just went right to work." Budd says he's not surprised by Speier's calls to curb this practice.  "Every two years at the beginning of a new Congress, there's a concerted effort by the left ... to try to kick us out of our offices," Budd says.  He thinks concerns that members living in their offices could magnify public health risks are unfounded.  "We're all adults here. We know how to wash our hands. We know how to have social distancing. We know how to be sanitary. And we all do that," he says. "And I just think this has nothing to do with COVID-19, but [Democrats are] certainly not going to let an opportunity like this or a crisis go to waste." Budd responded to Speier's claims via his own letter to the architect of the Capitol and the attending physician on May 19. He argues there isn't any evidence that members have been infected with COVID-19 as a result of sleeping in their offices.  "In fact, Members remaining in separate offices and not having to travel to and from apartments or houses off of the U.S. Capitol grounds makes social distancing easier and allows for less contact with potentially infected individuals," Budd writes.

             Rep. Ted Budd, R-N.C., right, seen here at his mock swearing-in with family in 2017, defends sleeping in his office. It's something former House Speaker Paul Ryan did as well. Budd urged the attending physician and the architect "not [to] be swayed by the ideological objections of certain Members who use any policy issue or national crisis to attempt to enact their long-held political agendas." He says there's an underlying agenda among Democrats to get a housing allowance in place for members.  Rank and file members of Congress make around $174,000 a year. One-bedroom apartments in D.C., which would likely serve as a secondary place of residence for members, can cost more than $2,000 a month.  "When people say, 'Well, it's very, very expensive to live in Washington,' that's true," Speier says. "But you ran for this office knowing what the salary was and what the expectation was. So to then decide that you're going to turn your office into a bedroom is not appropriate." And while Speier suggests looking into giving a per diem or a stipend to members to mitigate the cost of D.C. living, Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., says that's not Democrats' main goal.  "I've been a member for 27 years and I have paid rent every day that I have been there," he says. "So why would I push a housing allowance when I'm already paying?" Thompson has filed complaints with the House Committee on Ethics over the practice and introduced a bill in 2018 to prohibit members from sleeping in their offices as a way to save money.  Thompson agrees with Speier that the pandemic demands more urgent action.  "I think the attending physician will have to make some serious health and medical decisions around whether it's in the best interests for those members to be allowed to sleep in our offices, given what we know of the volatility of this pandemic and the fact that Washington, D.C., in itself is considered a hot spot," he explains. "I would hope that Congress takes a harder look at it and says, you know, it's one thing skirting the ethics rules, but it's really something else when you put lives at risk." Thompson says it's time to have a "frank" discussion in Congress about this practice, because there's also a financial aspect to it. "If I receive free rent, free utilities, free cable, free janitorial services, free gym services, then that's a value that I can't receive from anywhere else," he says. "I am, by virtue of staying in my office, receiving something that's probably worth $25,000 to $30,000 per year, if I had to monetize it."  The attending physician didn't include anything on this issue in its guidelines to members on returning to the Capitol, and declined NPR's request for an interview.Don't see the video? Click here. Cloth masks do a good job at keeping in large respiratory droplets that can spread a disease like COVID-19 — the kind of droplets you spit out when coughing or talking. That's why in April the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advised "the use of simple cloth face coverings to slow the spread of the virus and help people who may have the virus and do not know it from transmitting it to others." But there's another possible benefit to wearing a mask: protecting yourself from droplets. But masks, both homemade and made by vendors, vary in how good they are at keeping out pathogens. If you're looking to boost your mask's ability to filter out small particles, we've got three tips from researchers who've been testing mask materials in light of the pandemic — including a hack that involves a pair of pantyhose.More than 82,000 people in the United States have died of COVID-19 as of Tuesday. How many more lives will be lost? Scientists have built dozens of computational models to answer that question. But the profusion of forecasts poses a challenge: The models use such a wide range of methodologies, formats and time frames that it's hard to get even a ballpark sense of what the future has in store. Enter Nicholas Reich, a biostatistician at University of Massachusetts Amherst. Reich and his colleagues have developed a method to compare and ultimately to merge the diverse models of the disease's progression into one "ensemble" projection. The resulting forecast is sobering. By June 6, it projects, the cumulative death toll in the U.S. will reach 110,000. Reich's approach builds on work he has done over the past four years for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, pulling together the many forecasts that U.S. experts create annually to predict how that year's seasonal influenza will play out. Reich's team has set up a similar system to compare coronavirus models. It's a sort of portal through which the scientists behind each COVID-19 model can communicate key details about their methodology and results so that, as Reich explains, "all of these forecasts can be represented in a single standardized way. And this makes it really easy to make apples-to-apples comparisons between these models."  Loading...  The team unveiled the first version four weeks ago and ever since has been adding in more forecasts and updating the projections weekly. The latest update — released Tuesday — incorporates eight models, including some oft-cited ones, such as those built by the Imperial College London, the University of Washington Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, Columbia University and Northeastern University. (The team also sends each week's release to the CDC, which publishes a version with a slight time lag.) The projections vary substantially — with the most pessimistic forecasting a total death toll of 120,000 by June 6 and the most optimistic forecasting 103,000 deaths by that date. But the models have been inching closer to each other. Over the past several weeks, the distance between the highest and lowest estimates has halved from a gap of 36,000 deaths two weeks ago to a gap of 17,000 deaths in the most recent update released Tuesday. Still, says Reich, that remains a large difference. Also, he says, some of the models are gyrating fairly significantly from week to week. "The most pessimistic model a few weeks ago was the model from Los Alamos National Laboratory," notes Reich. "Now Los Alamos is one of the most optimistic." Meanwhile, the models produced by IHME and University of Texas at Austin respectively have substantially increased their projected deaths tolls — becoming among the most pessimistic. There are a range of reasons for these changes. The scientists are getting new data; they are updating their methods as they calibrate their models against the reality to date; and Americans have stopped social distancing to the same degree as they had been in March and April — requiring models that assumed a longer stay-at-home period to adjust their forecasts upward. But how do we make sense of these COVID-19 projections if the models can see-saw so abruptly from week to week? That's where Reich's "ensemble" model may be helpful. It's a strategy that forecasters use regularly to model not just disease outbreaks, but other phenomena ranging from weather to electoral outcomes. "Individual models are being changed every week. They're sensitive to the last observed data in different ways," says Reich. But with an ensemble "there's a certain consistency and robustness. You're not quite, sort of flapping in the wind." Caitlin Rivers, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, agrees. "We know from the experience of seasonal influenza that ensemble models tend to perform better than any single model," she says. And the approach is particularly well-suited in this pandemic given how much is still unknown. "This ensemble approach really pulls together those different results and makes them, in some ways, greater than the sum of their parts," says Rivers. Reich thinks he can still improve his ensemble model. For instance, at the moment Reich is giving equal weight to each of the forecasts that go into it. But soon he hopes to give more weight to those that are proving more accurate — an approach that he uses in his ensemble models for flu. "Model accuracy is one thing that we're tracking and we're hoping to release some information over the next few weeks," says Reich. "We've been sort of building the car as we're driving it at 90 miles an hour down the highway. And we're learning as we go." In the meantime, says Rivers, it is at least useful to be able to see the range of forecasts that have been produced. "It tends to help the user to understand where the uncertainties are and the spectrum of possible futures," she says. That said, Reich's setup compares projections through the next four weeks only — since many of the models don't offer forecasts beyond that point. This is why the latest update his team released projects deaths up to June 6. Still, in that first week of June about 7,000 people are projected to die. The clear implication, adds Reich: The cumulative death toll of 110,000 forecast through June 6 will unquestionably rise much higher in the weeks beyond.
                With more people working remotely, companies are turning to technology that tracks what employees are doing all day on their computers. Some workers say they feel like their privacy is being compromised.

             With more people working remotely, companies are turning to technology that tracks what employees are doing all day on their computers. Some workers say they feel like their privacy is being compromised. After two weeks of working from her Brooklyn apartment, a 25-year-old e-commerce worker received a staffwide email from her company: Employees were to install software called Hubstaff immediately on their personal computers so it could track their mouse movements and keyboard strokes, and record the webpages they visited. They also had to download an app called TSheets to their phones to keep tabs on their whereabouts during work hours. "There are five of us. And we always came to work. We always came on time. There was no reason to start location-tracking us," the woman told NPR. She spoke on the condition of anonymity, fearing she could lose her job. Company emails that she provided to NPR show her employer believed the tracking software would improve the team's productivity and efficiency while everyone was working from home. Such rationales are increasingly ringing throughout workplaces nationwide. The coronavirus pandemic has forced about a third of U.S. workers to do their jobs from home. In turn, companies are ramping up the use of software to monitor what their employees do all day. Privacy advocates and some workers said they worry that the intensified tracking brought upon by the coronavirus will normalize workplace surveillance and that this type of digital supervision will persist when workers return to offices. Just ask a woman who works in marketing at a small company in Minnesota. She also spoke to NPR anonymously out of fear her employer would retaliate against her for speaking out. Her employer has started using software called Time Doctor. It downloads videos of employees' screens while they work. It also can enable a computer's webcam to take a picture of the employee every 10 minutes. "If you're idle for a few minutes, if you go to the bathroom or whatever, a pop-up will come up and it'll say, 'You have 60 seconds to start working again or we're going to pause your time,' " the woman said. That meant stepping away from her computer briefly could cut into her pay. "I just feel like crap. I feel like I'm not trusted. I feel ashamed of myself," she said, referring to a short break she took to speak with a colleague by phone. "My co-workers were really, really upset. But everyone was too afraid to say anything." Your boss may know you're on Facebook even if you don't post  Critics call this kind of tracking software "tattleware." But Brad Miller, who runs the Connecticut-based company Awareness Technologies, bristles at that description. "If you're not working or doing something wrong, then I guess it will tattle on you, but I don't think that's really how companies that are buying [the software] think of it as," Miller said. Since the COVID-19 outbreak, Miller said that Awareness Technologies' business has tripled. Its programs for managers keep a record of every task employees are doing on their computers. Each worker then gets assigned a productivity score. Every employee is ranked accordingly. "Are they generally active on programs and websites that I would consider productive like Excel, PowerPoint, Word, email, as opposed to YouTube or Facebook?" Miller asked. "That's primarily what our customers are looking to know." Dave Nevogt, the CEO of Hubstaff, said demand has tripled for his company's monitoring software, too. "We have seen a massive increase in the number of people needing our platform," Nevogt told NPR. "Remote work has gotten a huge boost as everyone has been forced to work outside of the office, and we feel like these changes may be here for good." For bosses, keeping up with worker productivity has always been a give-and-take. But in the office, it is much easier to figure out if someone is doing a job well. Now tracking technology is taking the place of a manager's eyes. Miller said when the software runs on a homebound employee's computer, it gives the worker an added incentive not to slack off. "I think if people know it's happening, then people will act better than they would otherwise, because we all act better when someone is watching," Miller said. Intrusive? Maybe. Legal? Probably Alison Green, who writes the syndicated advice column Ask a Manager, has a different view. She has been flooded with questions from workers who feel icky about their bosses quantifying their keystrokes and how many emails they fire off each day. "And then there's a lower-tech version of that, which is people whose managers are asking them to stay on video all day long so they can watch over them every minute of the day, which is very intrusive," Green said. It may feel intrusive, but it is not illegal, said Paul Stephens, director of policy and advocacy with Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, a consumer advocacy nonprofit. While the Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable searches and seizures by the government, employers are not running afoul of any federal laws by tracking what their workers are doing all day through surveillance software, he said. "There's not a constitutional issue here," Stephens said. "There aren't a whole lot of legal protections for employees who are being monitored." Stephens said state laws vary over whether companies must even tell workers whether they're using tracking software. Some states do not require that workers be notified first. And with few legal barriers, employers who turn to this software during the pandemic may choose to keep using it even after work-from-home orders are lifted, he said. "Once the employer has made the investment in acquiring and installing the software, it's not likely that they're going to remove it," Stephens said. "This has for a long time been true, but maybe now more than ever it's safe to assume that everything you're doing is being watched and tracked by your employer." Choosing privacy over a paycheck Back in Brooklyn, the woman who works for the e-commerce startup said her employer's order to download Hubstaff and TSheets has strained relations between employees and their bosses. "It has really destroyed morale for everyone," she said. "And everyone has since kind of taken a step back and said, 'All right, if this is how they're going to treat us, why go the extra mile?' Because clearly it doesn't matter to them." Rather than download the software on her computer, she opted out. She's gone on unpaid leave until the office reopens. But the experience has soured her on her company. She's now hunting for a new job. "It's not worth it for me right now to sacrifice my personal privacy and all my data for a paycheck," she said. "It just made me very uncomfortable."We asked you to email us all of your questions about race and COVID-19, and you sent us some great ones. We went through the inbox and narrowed them down to six we wanted to sink our teeth into.  On this week's episode, Karen Grigsby Bates and Gene Demby respond to a white woman who's concerned about being an ally to an Asian friend who is worried about harassment. And we take on the question of why Native American communities are so vulnerable to COVID-19 — and why so little is being done about it.  And here, we've got answers to four more of your questions. First up, a related question about Native Americans: The news is focused on African Americans and COVID-19, but my impression is that Native Americans face the same problems. Are the statistics similar for Native Americans? — Marian Moore, New Orleans In an ideal world, the answer to this question would be straightforward; we would be able to look at national statistics about COVID-19 cases and deaths in different racial groups and compare the outcomes of African Americans outcomes with Native Americans.  Unfortunately, as Alexis Madrigal of the COVID Tracking Project pointed out in a recent episode, no such standard national statistics on race and the coronavirus exist. It's up to each state's public health department to report its own statistics, and while most regions — except for Nevada, Nebraska, North Dakota and four U.S. territories — are reporting some kind of racial or ethnic breakdown of cases and/or deaths, it's extremely scattered. For example, it's not possible to get a complete picture of the racial demographics of COVID-19 deaths for all 50 states and five major U.S. territories, because only 41 of those regions report those statistics.  To make matters worse, Native Americans often aren't counted at all in states' coronavirus racial trackers; instead, they're counted as "other." Rebecca Nagle, a writer and citizen of the Cherokee Nation, wrote about this problem for The Guardian, finding that about half the states reporting racial data are lumping indigenous folks into the "other" category.  That's a huge problem when trying to figure out how Native Americans are being affected, Nagle says. She has seen that several states, including Michigan, have opted to lump Native people into "other" because they make up less than 1% of the state's population. But those small numbers are a result of centuries of genocide of Native peoples, as Abigail Echo-Hawk, the chief research officer of the Seattle Indian Health Board, told Nagle. And despite making up a small share of the total population, the community often sees disproportionately bad public health outcomes, Nagle argues.  "A lot of times, when you look at the impact of things in our communities, you see that we're being impacted by things two to three to five to 10 times what the rest of the United States is," Nagle says. Those disproportionate impacts are playing out right now at their most extreme in New Mexico, where Native Americans make up a little over 10% of the total population, but over half of the coronavirus deaths, according to the state's public health department. And the Navajo Nation, whose land spans Arizona, New Mexico and Utah, has seen a huge number of cases. The Indian Health Service reports that, as of May 10, 3,363 of the Nation's residents have tested positive, accounting for more than half of all the estimated COVID cases in Indian country.  Loading...  So far, from the available data, we've seen that COVID-19 has impacted Native Americans at disproportionate rates, similar to African Americans. But that data is woefully incomplete, and it's unclear whether epidemiologists will ever get good nationwide data about the disease's impact on Native people. I am concerned about the disproportionately high rate of maternal mortality of African American women and what this virus might mean for them. I am also concerned about the recommendations of not letting a support person into hospitals with a laboring person. I feel like this is a recipe for disaster. — Jenny Gaskell, Wisconsin Unfortunately, Jenny is right to be concerned. Although there's no hard data on how people giving birth in the U.S. have been affected by the coronavirus, medical experts told us that they're concerned about pregnant women during this time. After all, women in the United States are dying in childbirth at a rate higher than any other "developed" country, and it's the only country where the rate has been rising.  But for years, we've known that black women are significantly more likely to die during childbirth than white women; to be exact, the CDC found in 2019 that black women were 3.3 times more likely to die. Their babies are twice as likely to die during infancy than white babies. A study in 2016 found that black women with a college degree were still more likely to die than a white woman who never graduated high school.  "The reason we're dying is because we've been put in harm's way for generations," says Dr. Joia Crear-Perry, founder and president of the National Birth Equity Collaborative. "The consequences of being put in harm's way, of being devalued, being seen as less than worthy, comes out in our policy and our outcomes. And it really ultimately shows up being overrepresented in death."  Crear-Perry notes that added safety precautions at hospitals have restricted delivery-room access for support people, such as doulas. And for black women, a support person is often the only other person in the room advocating for them when doctors dismiss their concerns, she says.   "You want, as a health care provider, the person to have support because it makes their birth better. It makes their outcomes better. It makes them calm. They're not an ancillary part," Crear-Perry added.  So, the short answer to this question? Birth advocates are worrying and thinking about this problem, too.  To me, it feels like we don't have much of a social safety net and that much of what we do have is tied into schools —meals, laundry, emotional support, even health care to an extent. How are we seeing kids of different races being impacted by this lack of protection differently? — Ama Kwabia, North Carolina That's a correct hunch. Schools in the United States have come to represent essential places for many families, and not just because they're where children go to learn.  Michelle Burris with the Century Foundation, a progressive think tank tackling research around subjects including education and the economy, has been finding concerning outcomes during the ongoing pandemic. Black, Latino and indigenous youth are the most affected by a lack of a social net in school, she told us, because "unfortunately this country has not been able to decouple race and poverty." Burris noted that all parents have lost the child care schools provided. But, with 37.7 percent of black workers employed in essential industries, black workers 50% more likely to work in the health care industry and 40% more likely to work in hospitals, the loss of child care is forcing many parents to leave their children at home without supervision.  She's worried about two things in particular: food insecurity and a lack of Internet access. In the United States, 1 in 5 children rely on food stamp assistance and over 50 percent of students qualify for free or reduced-price lunches. It's a problem persistent in communities of color. Many schools are aware of the fact that for many children, schools are the one place they can receive daily meals, as our colleagues on NPR's education team have reported. Many have opened grab-and-go food centers or opted to deliver meals via school bus. And the shift to online learning has highlighted similar disparities in Internet access. The percentage of students with limited or no access is highest in American Indian/Alaska Native students (27 percent) followed by black students (19 percent). In rural neighborhoods, 41 percent of black students and 26 percent of Hispanic students reported having no Internet.   "Internet is not a luxury. It's a civil right, because students need the Internet in order to complete their homework [and classwork]," Burris says.  Burris recently interviewed teachers across the country about what they were seeing in their own classrooms in regards to the digital divide. One teacher in St. Louis reported that, in her nearly all-black classroom, only about 20 percent of her students log into Zoom classes. In Massachusetts, one teacher saw that before the pandemic, 7% of her students had C's or D's. "Now," Burris says, "almost 60% of her kids are failing because the kids don't have a laptop."  Many of my black and Latinx family members are having trouble believing the severity of COVID-19. There is very little trust for the government and medicine. With the context of our history, I understand their feelings and share them too. However, I also believe social distancing is required to get through this pandemic. I have watched so many of my people out and about like NOTHING is happening. Now this week several close family members have been hospitalized with COVID-19 Can we convince them to stay home? —Altinay Cortes, Philadelphia  Here's a suggestion: Help your family; don't lecture them. They might be confused about what's safe, because every state has different guidelines, and there's a lot of conflicting information out there. Even for people who are following the news closely, the guidance has changed so much: Remember when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said wearing masks wasn't necessary to stop the spread, and then changed that guidance in April? So there's conflicting advice out there, combined with the long history of government and medical officials not doing right by people of color. Medical racism is as old as modernity itself; and so you can understand why some families aren't hanging on every word from the CDC. Try this with your loved one: Tell them it's better to be supersafe than sorry. If you think they might read (and take seriously) articles by leading science writers like Ed Yong or Caroline Chen, send them along. And help them get the personal protective gear that they might need, like the masks, hand sanitizer and disinfecting wipes. That way, it doesn't sound like you're scolding them. One more thing: Make sure your folks are following fact-based, reputable news sources. One pundit saying that social distancing is unnecessary can do a lot of damage.

             The latest inflation data offers a snapshot of Americans' new pandemic spending habits. Prices are down for most goods and services but up sharply for groceries. Updated at 10:32 a.m. ET Food prices have jumped the most since 1974, when double-digit inflation became a national concern. But inflation isn't a worry this time as prices for  just about everything else are diving. New inflation numbers out Tuesday from the Labor Department offer a window on how consumers are coping in the COVID-19 era. And the bottom line is that we're snacking more — and paying more for a lot of food — as we shop more at our local grocery stores. Overall, consumer prices were down 0.8% last month — the sharpest drop since the Great Recession in 2008. But food prices at the grocery store rose 2.6% — the biggest jump in nearly 50 years.   The price of pasta and rice bubbled up 2.5% in April. Hamburger prices ground up 4.8%. And anyone who bought cookies had to lay out 5.1% more dough. Americans had grown used to spending more than half their food budgets on meals eaten outside the home. But that changed abruptly when the coronavirus pandemic hit. Restaurants closed their doors, and families were forced to cook for themselves. "We saw an immediate, drastic decrease in expenditures away from home and an increase in the expenditures that we made at the grocery store," said David Ortega, a food economist at Michigan State University. Ortega sees the change in his own habits. Instead of buying a prepared coffee at the campus bagel shop, he's making his own coffee at home with store-bought beans. He's also shopping for his wife and 2-year-old daughter. "Yep, I have to now go to the grocery store and make sure we have snacks and goldfish and crackers and just about everything that's going up in price," Ortega said. There's little evidence that people's overall food consumption has increased (although the price of snacks jumped 3.8% last month). But where and what we're eating has shifted. And that's created some costly kinks in the supply chain. Ortega warned that beef and pork prices are likely to climb in the weeks ahead, as a result of bottlenecks at slaughterhouses, which have become hot spots for coronavirus infections. Most of us aren't driving much, so gasoline prices tumbled 20.6% last month. The price of auto insurance also dropped in April, by 7.2% — more than any other month on record. "With people driving less, that will inevitably mean fewer accidents," said Sean Kevelighan, CEO of the Insurance Information Institute. Auto insurers are offering discounts and refunds totaling more than $10 billion this year. Kevelighan warns, however, that with fewer cars on the road, some people are driving faster. That means the accidents that do happen are often more costly. "In fact, people are driving more recklessly at this time. And so that means we're having more injuries and greater damage," he said. The inflation report tells us more about how our consumption patterns have changed during the pandemic.   As demand for toilet paper soared, household paper prices jumped 4.5% last month. There are a handful of other categories where prices rose — including hospital care (up 0.5%) and funerals (up 0.3%). But while Americans are spending more on necessities like pasta and toilet paper, they're cutting back on everything else. "Accordingly, prices are falling. Apparel was down on the month again. Airline fares are plummeting. Hotel prices [are] down," said Kathy Bostjancic, chief U.S. financial economist for Oxford Economics. The price of used cars dropped 0.4% last month and could fall further if rental car companies decide they have too many cars and sell some of their surplus. There could be some bargains on the used car lot. But with millions of Americans suddenly out of work, it's not clear who will want to buy. "Therein lies the issue," Bostjancic said. "And that's why you're seeing across the consumer spectrum deep discounting." If you take out volatile food and gasoline prices, the cost of everything else fell 0.4% last month. Over the last year, these so-called "core prices" rose just 1.4%. That suggests the government could afford to keep borrowing and spending money on emergency relief programs without fear of runaway prices. "Inflation is the least of our worries right now," Bostjancic said.House Democrats plan to move forward with a $3 trillion bill for additional coronavirus relief, following up on the historic $2 trillion aid package passed in March.  The latest bill, called the HEROES Act, prioritizes granting hazard pay to front-line workers and providing aid to state and local governments, which had not been allotted in previous bills.  The House could hold a vote on the measure as soon as Friday. It is not expected to gain traction in the Senate, though, as bipartisan talks on the latest recovery package have stalled.

             Medical workers prepare to use a swab to administer a coronavirus test at a drive-through center on March 21 in Jericho, N.Y. The Trump administration says it will now spend billions of dollars to help states make COVID-19 testing more widely available, a move meant to address months-long complaints about test shortages. But here's the puzzle: Many labs say they have plenty of tests. So what's the disconnect? Turns out a "test" is not a single device. COVID-19 testing involves several steps, each one requiring different supplies, and there are shortages of different supplies at different times in different places.  But despite warnings about supply shortages by health experts and governors at least as early as February, the federal government took until late April to ramp up domestic production of swabs — a universal ingredient in the most common type of COVID-19 test. The swab test checks for active infections, unlike an antibody test, which involves drawing blood to check whether the body has recovered from the virus. Step 1 of a swab test is collecting a sample, and the most common way to do that is by swabbing a patient's nose or throat. Sample collection usually involves a swab, a tube and a chemical solution called "viral transport media," which keeps the sample fresh as it travels to a laboratory. There are dozens of types of FDA-approved swab tests, and the swabbing is usually done at hospitals, community health centers or drive-through testing sites. Step 2 takes place at a lab. There, genetic material is extracted from the sample. That requires a special machine and chemicals called reagents. Once the genetic material is extracted, Step 3 occurs: A machine checks whether that genetic material contains any of the coronavirus. If it does, the sample has tested positive for COVID-19. "A test is not simply a one-component test, but is made up of many different components," said Heather Pierce, senior director for science policy and regulatory counsel at the Association of American Medical Colleges. "If any one of those components is missing or has insufficient quantities, the test can't happen." The COVID-19 testing process has been plagued by missing components, including swabs, reagents and the chemical solution that keeps samples fresh. Some weeks, there are shortages of some but not others, or one location has them and another doesn't. Take swabs. They are able to work with any approved swab test. The name suggests something as simple as a Q-tip, but they are more specialized. Nasopharyngeal swabs, as they're called, are considered medical devices and must be long and flexible enough to get all the way through the nose to the back of the throat. At an April 17 press briefing, President Trump said that in the next few weeks, the federal government would be sending millions of swabs to the states, and he added: "Mostly, it's cotton. It's not a big deal." But Trump was wrong. Cotton can interfere with test results because it contains its own genetic material, so nasopharyngeal swabs are typically made of polyester, nylon, foam or some other synthetic material.

             President Trump compares a cotton swab (left) to a swab that could be used in coronavirus testing during a briefing on April 19. Two days prior, Trump erroneously said cotton swabs could be used for coronavirus testing. On April 20, Vice President Pence, speaking publicly about a phased reopening of the economy, said this: "By our best estimates, we have enough testing capacity today for every state in America to go to Phase 1." But "testing capacity" does not necessarily mean testing is happening. Remember: Testing involves not just swabbing, but also having a sample analyzed at a lab. And labs may have the machines that analyze samples, but if there aren't enough swabs, those machines may sit idle. In other words, a shortage of swabs may prevent labs from operating at full testing capacity. So why is there a shortage of something as seemingly simple as swabs? For one reason, there had been only two major manufacturers of these swabs worldwide — Puritan Medical Products in Maine and Copan Diagnostics in Italy. When COVID-19 hit and demand for swabs skyrocketed, the companies became overwhelmed and couldn't keep up. "I don't think the United States was prepared," said Timothy Templet, Puritan's executive vice president of global sales. "That includes us, Puritan. It includes our customers. And it includes the government ... And now it gets really nerve-wracking to think that we may be in this for another couple years." 
                Puritan Medical Products employees work in the Guilford, Maine, plant in 2017. On April 29, 2020, the federal government announced Puritan had been awarded a $75.5 million contract to produce more swabs for coronavirus testing.

             Puritan Medical Products employees work in the Guilford, Maine, plant in 2017. On April 29, 2020, the federal government announced Puritan had been awarded a $75.5 million contract to produce more swabs for coronavirus testing. The U.S. government could have been amassing swabs in the Strategic National Stockpile, a federal warehouse of medical supplies, but was not. The government also has the Defense Production Act, a tool the Trump administration used in late March to require General Motors to produce more ventilators for coronavirus patients. But the administration did not act as quickly to use that tool for swab shortages, even though some people were advising that. "Weeks ago," Washington Gov. Jay Inslee told NPR on April 16, "I spoke to the president and urged him to invoke the Defense Production Act and mobilize the incredible supply chains that the Department of Defense has and to ask them to convert some of their production from other hardware and software to swabs and contact vials and machines that can do analysis. And he did not agree with that assessment, and we lost weeks, frankly." That was not the first time the federal government had been warned of swab shortages. On Feb. 12, at a hearing on pandemic preparedness, a group of prominent health experts told a U.S. Senate committee that the country has a testing supply chain problem. On March 16, former FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb tweeted that "swabs could be a weak link in broadening testing." On March 17, Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo told CNN that "the problem is swabs." During the same time period, there were other public distress calls about supply shortages. In mid-March, the government acted: It flew shipments of swabs from Italy to the U.S. But that still didn't meet demand, and complaints about shortages were still continuing in mid-April. On April 19, President Trump said he would use the Defense Production Act to increase swab production. On April 29, the government said Puritan Medical Products had been awarded a $75.5 million contract to produce more swabs.

             A health care worker seals a coronavirus swab after testing at a coronavirus testing site on April 30 in Wantagh, N.Y. Puritan's goal is to produce at least an additional 20 million swabs a month, and it's building a new factory to do that. But it's hard to say whether that's enough to meet demand because it's difficult to get consensus on how much COVID-19 testing the U.S. should be doing, and how many swabs can be produced. Consider the experience of the American Society for Microbiology, which asked in mid-April to speak with Dr. Deborah Birx's team on the White House coronavirus task force to find out what was being done to address testing supply shortages — and discovered that the White House was trying to figure out the same thing. "Something happened that was very surprising," recalled Dr. Robin Patel, the organization's president. "First of all, Ambassador Birx is a wonderful person and has very good insight into the challenges that are happening ... but what they did is they turned around and they asked the American Society for Microbiology to help with this situation. That's not why we were there. We were there asking for information." So Patel's group gave the coronavirus task force its feedback. "We are pleased to be able to help," said Patel, noting that the pandemic is a complicated situation and that everyone needs to work together to solve it. "But we were not there to volunteer to help. That was what was surprising — was the ask back to us."  The American Society for Microbiology's experience makes clear that nearly three months into the pandemic, the Trump administration was still struggling to understand the shortage of swabs and other test supplies, and how to fix it. To help address the shortage, the FDA has approved more types of swabs, and an Ohio company is converting a plant to make swabs. The FDA has also approved a saliva test that does not require a swab. And this week, the White House said it would send $11 billion to state governments to expand testing and make sure each state has enough testing supplies, although it said it wants to focus on high-risk communities like nursing homes. So it remains unclear how widespread testing will ever be in the U.S. NPR's Laura Sullivan, Graham Smith and Tim Mak contributed to this story.

             Amid the coronavirus pandemic, a masked pedestrian passes a banner honoring health care workers in the window of a medical center in Boston. House Democrats are proposing hazard pay for front-line workers in a new relief bill. Updated at 4:11 p.m. ET House Democrats are moving full steam ahead with legislation to provide a new wave of coronavirus relief at a price tag of more than $3 trillion, with plans to call the full House back on Friday to approve it. Democrats are moving forward without Republican support since bipartisan talks have stalled, and the legislation is expected to be dead on arrival for the GOP-led Senate. But Democrats say the plan, dubbed the Heroes Act, details the priorities they believe need to be addressed as the economic and public health impacts of the coronavirus pandemic worsen. The more than 1,800-page bill marks a long wish list for Democrats, including nearly $1 trillion to state, local and tribal governments and another round of direct cash payments to Americans. It extends unemployment benefits to January, adds hazard pay for front-line workers and expands virus-testing efforts. "We must think big for the people now, because if we don't, it will cost more in lives and livelihood later," House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said Tuesday. "Not acting is the most expensive course. We are presenting a plan to do what is necessary to deal with the [coronavirus] crisis and make sure we can get the country back to work and school safely." Democrats are viewing the legislation as a critical marker of what they see as gaps left by the previous roughly $3 trillion in spending that has already been enacted in the last two months. Bipartisan talks to reach a deal on a fifth relief bill haven't gotten off the ground as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., says it's time first to evaluate how the previous packages are working. He is also insisting that any new bill include liability protections for businesses and individuals, a move Democrats oppose. The chamber's leaders were also quick to slam the Democrats' plan on Tuesday. "This is nothing more than a messaging exercise from House Democrats," said Senate Majority Whip John Thune, R-S.D. "It is an effort to try and create talking points for the 2020 election. It's not going anywhere, and we know that." Among its provisions, the Democratic proposal provides $200 billion to essential workers in pandemic hazard pay. It also adds another $75 billion for coronavirus testing, contact tracing and treatment efforts. Many Democrats, including House Democratic Caucus Vice Chair Katherine Clark, D-Mass., say the coronavirus crisis has exposed significant systemic shortcomings in the way the federal government supports workers and families. "The coronavirus pandemic has exposed gaping holes in our social safety net," Clark said in an interview. "It has brought into stark relief issues that we knew were there but now we can see their devastating impacts so clearly." Clark is advocating for new child care funding and programs to make it easier for families, and women in particular, to return to work as schools and child care facilities remain closed. Democrats say it will be difficult to restart the economy without some intervention to keep businesses afloat and to allow workers to return safely to their jobs. Some moderate Democrats are wary about approving another large spending bill but have been largely willing to support the additional spending as long as it is closely tailored to the coronavirus response, according to aides familiar with the talks. Most Democrats are referring to the legislation as a follow-up to the CARES Act, which was approved in March, but it is not seen as the final action that Congress will have to take in response to the coronavirus. The new legislative proposal, released Tuesday, provides large sums for some of Democrats' top priorities, including $500 billion in direct, flexible aid for state governments and an additional $357 billion for local governments and counties. Many Senate Republicans have criticized the push for more state aid, arguing that any new money needs to be tied to the pandemic and not help address budget issues that predated the crisis. Democrats set aside $3.6 billion to protect federal elections, $25 billion to support the U.S. Postal Service, $100 billion for low-income rent support, $75 billion for a homeowner assistance fund and $100 million for the Violence Against Women Prevention and Prosecution Programs. The bill includes some changes to programs that were approved in the CARES Act, including an expansion of the IRS payment program. Democrats want more generous benefits for families, including a $1,200 payment for each dependent. The CARES Act limits payments to $500 per child; adults or other dependents do not currently qualify. The bill provides up to $6,000 per household. It also expands funding for small-business loans, enhances an employee-retention tax credit program and boosts worker protections. Republicans have already rejected many elements of the bill, including a suspension of the cap on the state and local tax deduction that was approved as part of the 2017 GOP-led tax cuts. Democrats also want to extend emergency family and medical leave until the end of 2021. Doing so is part of their broader focus on child care and family support. The official scorekeepers at the Congressional Budget Office estimate that the earlier version of the leave provisions, which passed in March and extend through the end of this year, would themselves cost $105 billion. The latest proposal would more than double the length of those benefits. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., on Tuesday highlighted the funding for safe elections. The plan "is a further response to this unprecedented challenge to our people, to our health and to our economic well-being," Hoyer said. The House is also planning to vote separately on Friday on a Democratic plan that would allow some members to vote by proxy when they are unable to return to the Capitol because of the health crisis. The proposal also sets up procedures for lawmakers to participate in hearings remotely. The House Rules Committee is slated to take up the funding bill, as well as the remote voting and hearings bill, on Thursday to ready the measures for Friday's floor action.

             Many counties in Georgia may not have enough hospital beds to treat a new wave of COVID-19 patients, according to internal federal government documents. Above, a barbershop in Atlanta on April 27. Georgia — one of the first states to reopen its economy — may not have enough hospital beds to treat a new wave of critically ill patients infected with the coronavirus, according to internal federal government documents obtained by the Center for Public Integrity. A slide prepared by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for an interagency briefing last week said Georgia's intensive care unit beds were 79% full on May 6, based on data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. "Data suggest that Georgia may have limited healthcare capacity margin to respond to a future surge in critically ill patients," reads the slide, which is marked "NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION." The warning for Georgia comes even as the White House and federal agencies shift their focus to helping states restart their economies. The federal government also wants states to assume more responsibility for pandemic response. The Federal Emergency Management Agency, for one, is planning a "right-sizing" of its operations after Memorial Day, and HHS is making plans to "transition back to a regionally managed public health emergency" approach, said officials on a recording of a meeting from last week obtained by Public Integrity. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, allowed gyms, bowling alleys, hair salons and some other businesses to reopen April 24. He lifted all other restrictions at the end of April, while advising elderly and sick people to stay home.  "What we've done has worked," Kemp told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. "It's given us time to build our hospital infrastructure capacity, get ventilators and ramp up testing. That's what really drove our decision." Kemp has also cited concerns about Georgia's economy, one of the hardest hit by job losses, when defending his reopening plan.  Kemp's spokesperson, Cody Hall, told Public Integrity that he would not comment on how the state would handle any future coronavirus surge. Hall pointed to the state's data on hospital bed capacity, which is slightly rosier than the federal outlook. The state has also set up a 200-bed temporary hospital in an Atlanta convention center and, with the help of FEMA, dispatched four mobile units of about 22 beds each to different corners of the state. If Georgia's decision to reopen early backfires, certain residents may shoulder the bulk of the consequences — not only the elderly, who are at higher risk of complications from the virus, but also African Americans.  A CDC study released last week showed that a disproportionate number of Georgians hospitalized with COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, are African American. And while African Americans make up about 30% of Georgia's population, they account for half of reported COVID-19 deaths. Georgia Tech professor Pinar Keskinocak said she is not surprised by the HHS assessment that the state may run out of ICU beds. "That's very much in line with our predictions as well," said Keskinocak, who leads a team modeling several potential scenarios for the future of the coronavirus in Georgia. "In most of those scenarios, we found that there would be shortages." Keskinocak's modeling team at Georgia Tech determined that hospitals in the state would run out of beds for COVID-19 patients before mid-August in all but two of the 14 local hospital regions — even if 60% of Georgians did a good job at staying at home when they or their household members felt sick. The Georgia Tech group has shared its projections with the state's Department of Public Health.  "I can tell you they are listening very carefully. But what happens beyond that I cannot tell," Keskinocak said. "The input they get from modelers is one input. How they trade off many of those things and make a decision, I don't know." Stephen Daugherty, CEO of Coliseum Medical Centers in Macon, Georgia, said that he's not at this time worried about a surge in coronavirus cases but that Georgians should consider social distancing "important" until there is a vaccine or "a sufficient number are determined to be immune through herd immunity."  Hospitals across the U.S. have used the last few months of social distancing to add beds, acquire ventilators and otherwise prepare for a potential surge in COVID-19 patients. But the CDC data show that in Georgia, the District of Columbia and five other states — Alabama, Colorado, Maryland, Rhode Island and Washington — more than 70% of ICU beds were in use as of May 12. The White House listed "ability to surge ICU capacity" as one of the key requirements for states in its reopening plan released in April. Experts have also said hospitals must be ready to handle a sudden onslaught of patients.  "The capacity to cope with a surge in cases, and to detect it promptly, are the minimal requirements as states calibrate reopening," said William Hanage, a Harvard University epidemiologist, in an email. The White House did not respond to a request for comment. An HHS spokesperson who refused to be named said the coronavirus response is "federally supported but led by the local authorities" and will continue to be. FEMA did not directly answer questions about winding down its operations, but a spokesperson who refused to be named said it would continue leading the coronavirus response until directed otherwise by President Trump. The CDC did not answer a question about whether it had warned Georgia about the potential shortage of hospital beds. The CDC is offering local officials "technical assistance, tools, and resources that are specific to the circumstances and needs in their communities," CDC spokesperson Kristen Nordlund said in an email. "States are empowered to make decisions about opening up and any questions about their decisions and capacity should be directed at them." The Georgia Department of Public Health did not answer a question about whether the state's ICU bed capacity was sufficient. Data published by the state were slightly more optimistic about hospitals' bed capacity there. The same day it was reported at the federal briefing that 79% of Georgia ICU beds were full, according to CDC data, the state reported the figure at 73%. As of Tuesday, the CDC reported that 71% of Georgia's ICU beds were full; Georgia said 66% as of Monday. According to Georgia's data, the portion of Georgia critical care beds that are full has hovered around 70% since April 14, the earliest date for which the state has reported such numbers.   The CDC data are based on a nationwide survey of hospitals and do not include every institution; the Georgia data are self-reported by hospitals, said Georgia Department of Public Health spokesperson Nancy Nydam, who offered no further details.  Georgia as a whole is seeing a slight decrease in its average new daily coronavirus cases since late April — from 741 in the week ending April 26 to 702 in the week ending May 10. But in the 21 counties that make up the Atlanta metropolitan statistical area — which has the bulk of the state's coronavirus cases — the average of new daily cases has gone up in that same time frame. And ICU beds in the region are already mostly full. ICU beds in the 12-county hospital region just south of Atlanta were 89%  full on May 11, state data show. Most of the other regions bordering Atlanta were over 70% full.  In the region home to Atlanta and the CDC's headquarters, nearly 2 in every 3 critical care beds were occupied.  But other places in Georgia have more wiggle room. Hospitals in southeast Georgia still had more than half of their ICU beds available May 11. The state had witnessed more than 34,000 total confirmed COVID-19 cases and more than 1,400 deaths as of Tuesday, May 12.

             Engineers work on a potential vaccine for the coronavirus at a Beijing lab. Most health experts agree that the need for a vaccine to prevent COVID-19 is clear. "To return to a semblance of previous normality, the development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines is an absolute necessity" is how a perspective in Science magazine puts it. So it's hardly surprising that, around the world, anticipation is high. With more than 100 coronavirus vaccines under development, researchers are reasonably confident that at least one will be successful. Skeptics, and there are some, remind us that optimism about an AIDS vaccine was once high, and 40 years later there is no vaccine. Still, even if experts today are right that a vaccine for COVID-19 will be easier to develop than an AIDS vaccine, estimates for when it will be widely available vary. Here are some of the vaccine-related questions being raised — and what we know at this point. Is the timeline for COVID-19 faster than for previous vaccines? President Trump has offered perhaps the most optimistic estimate. He said he expects the United States to have a vaccine by the end of 2020.  So far, it does seem as though the vaccine will be developed faster than ever before in vaccine history. It took more than two decades to come up with a successful polio vaccine. Federal health officials suggest a COVID-19 vaccine may be ready in a tenth of that time. But there are only some things that you can fast-track, and others, not so much. And even though the Food and Drug Administration is going to be evaluating the various stages of testing with great speed in this case, certain standards must be met: First, you have to prove that a vaccine is safe. Then you need to prove that it generates the immune response you want. And then you need to find out if it actually prevents people from getting sick if they're exposed to the virus.  How would researchers know they have developed a vaccine that works? Vaccine studies present researchers with a conundrum: You want people to be exposed to the disease being targeted because you need to know if your vaccine is working, and yet in another sense you don't want them being exposed because you don't want them to get sick.  The way you know that the vaccine is effective is that you give a vaccine to one group of people and another group gets a sham injection that doesn't contain the vaccine being tested. Then you see if the vaccinated group is protected.   So how are they going to get exposed to, in this case, the novel coronavirus? Well, if there's a lot of virus circulating in the population, that's one way.  Another possibility that people have talked about is intentionally infecting volunteers with the virus and then seeing if a candidate vaccine prevents them from getting sick. That way you know for sure that the volunteer testers have been exposed and can be confident the vaccine works if that person does not get sick. Such studies, known as challenge trials, are ethically fraught, since you are deliberately infecting volunteers with a potentially lethal virus for which there is no cure. The alternative to challenge trials is to vaccinate enough people so that you can be confident that some fraction of them will be exposed to the virus. The number you need to vaccinate depends on how prevalent the coronavirus is in the area where the vaccine is being tested. You then compare the vaccinated group with another group that received a sham vaccine to look for efficacy.  Once a vaccine has been developed, how does the manufacturing process work? "The requirement to scale up to the kinds of numbers we're talking about within the short time-frame that we're speaking about would be an extraordinary effort," says Emilio Emini, who has been working on vaccines for decades and now leads the HIV program at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (which is a funder of NPR and of this blog).  Making billions of doses of vaccine is a herculean task. The tools that you need for manufacturing one vary considerably depending on the kind of vaccine you're making, but in many cases, you need something called a bioreactor — a giant tank that allows the organisms that are actually spewing out the vaccine of interest to grow.  Sometimes you could be talking about a 20,000-gallon bioreactor, and you're not going to go down to your local hardware store and pick one of those up. So that's one issue. There's specialty equipment that has to be made. In addition to the big stuff, there are smaller things to take into consideration, such as medical-grade glass. "You have to put a product into a sterile vial or syringe, and there's only so much of that glass to go around," says Fred Porter, senior vice president for technical operations at Adrenas Therapeutics. "If we're thinking about billions of doses to be able to deliver vaccines around the world, that becomes a significant bottleneck." Is making a vaccine available globally important?  Definitely. Seth Berkley, CEO of an organization called Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, believes you can't roll out a vaccine one country at a time. "We're not going to be safe as a world unless everywhere is safe," he says. "So even if we had parts of the world that would have low spread or no spread, if you had large reservoirs of the virus in other places, of course you have a risk of reintroduction." With more than 100 vaccines in development around the world, is it safe to say the majority of them are never going to become viable candidates? Yes. They may not succeed for a variety of reasons. They may not work, or they work but are too hard to manufacture. At this stage of development, many are expected to fail. That's just the nature of vaccine trials.  Is it possible that we don't get just one vaccine but that multiple vaccines are developed that might work even in somewhat different ways? It seems likely because there are multiple approaches to making vaccines that have advantages and disadvantages. Some are tried and true and have worked for other viral illnesses. Some you can make much faster, but it's unclear that they'll be as effective. Experts such as Emilio Emini believe the parallel development of multiple vaccines is a good thing. "It's my perspective that this is going to require more than one successful vaccine," he says. "It's going to require at least several, if not more, that are successfully developed in parallel so that the scope of what will be needed can be satisfied."  Will the coronavirus vaccine be like the annual flu vaccine in that it changes every year because the virus changes every year, or will it be more like the measles or the polio vaccine, which is fixed? Unfortunately, right now the answer is unclear. There is some indication that this virus doesn't change very rapidly, so if you find a vaccine that works against it, it may work in perpetuity. But researchers also don't know how long immunity to this virus lasts, so we may need to get booster shots — not a different shot every year but a booster of the same shot to make the vaccine actually work for multiple years. How hopeful should we be that there will be a vaccine that works and that we can get our hands on by next year? Several companies, governments and foundations are betting billions of dollars that it will be possible. Paul Stoffels, chief scientific officer for Johnson & Johnson, says he's optimistic because of his company's recent experience making vaccines for other viral diseases.  "We have done it with Zika, RSV (respiratory syncytial virus), Ebola," he says. "We know what we do. And if we plug a new virus into that system, we are pretty sure we can get to a vaccine."  That said, vaccine people will tell you that every time you start working on a vaccine for a new virus, you don't know what the hurdles will be. There's a lot of work that needs to be done before we know for sure whether those bets will pay off.

             David Edwards was the team mascot for the Quad Cities River Bandits in Davenport, Iowa. David Edwards thought he'd be spending this baseball season prowling the ballpark in Davenport, Iowa, trading high-fives and cheering the home team. After all, it would be his second season playing mascot for the Quad Cities River Bandits. "I am the big raccoon," Edwards says. "It's the most fun I've ever had." But there's no joy in Davenport — the River Bandits aren't playing ball this year because of the pandemic. While major league teams hope to revive their season for a TV-only audience later this year, Single-A clubs like the River Bandits depend on in-person ticket sales and concessions to pay the bills.

             David Edwards (left) and Ray Hernandez, manager of the Quad City River Bandits. Edwards lost a second job, showing visitors around a regional zoo, when that also closed to the public. "All the plans for this year went out the window," Edwards says. "Guest relations aren't essential when nothing is open." Edwards, who majored in music at Iowa State University, also planned to audition for classical singing gigs this summer. But with most big cities under lockdown, that's on hold, too. That's three strikes, and Edwards is worried. "I feel very scared about my future," he says. "I just don't know what funding is going to be, what festivals or programs are going to survive." FACES OF THE CORONAVIRUS RECESSION  Jobs lost. Businesses in peril. Meetings gone virtual. Faces Of The Coronavirus Recession offers snapshots of working Americans whose lives have been upended by the pandemic.  For now, Edwards is living off savings, trying to figure out what life's going to look like after the summer and keeping a positive attitude. "Just trying to do what's right and what's recommended and what's healthy," he says. "I just don't want to be part of the problem." Read more stories in Faces Of The Coronavirus Recession. Cast members have recorded sketches remotely for Saturday Night Live at Home. During the pandemic lockdown, what's left of Hollywood production has gone virtual. Late-night TV hosts Trevor Noah, Stephen Colbert and the Jimmys — Fallon and Kimmel — record monologues from their homes. Saturday Night Live at Home, which had its finale over the weekend, had its cast mates and guest stars tape themselves, too. A special reunion episode of Parks and Recreation that aired recently was also written, shot, directed and edited remotely. Showrunner Mike Schur says he and the director, script supervisor and editors worked from their homes, watching on Zoom as the actors did their own camerawork.  "We didn't actually fully know what anything looked like until we got the footage back. It was always a little bit of a surprise," Schur says. "There were things that were recorded at the wrong frame rate, the little lights that were attached to the mini-rigs that we sent out kept malfunctioning in the middle of takes. It was a struggle." In the end, Schur says the episode worked as a one-off since the series always had a "let's put on a show" sensibility. But Schur, who created The Good Place and Brooklyn Nine-Nine and the upcoming series Rutherford Falls, says the do-it-yourself method isn't a long-term solution because making a comedy is a team sport. "It can't be everyone in his or her own house acting has his or her own hair, makeup, DP [director of photography], rigger, gaffer, grip," Schur says. "It was really fun to do, but it's not a blueprint for anything."

             A special reunion episode of Parks and Recreation was written, shot, directed and edited remotely. "It was a struggle," showrunner Mike Schur admits. Casting director Jennifer Euston can no longer safely audition actors in person at her small New York City office. And she can't scout for talent at the theater, like she did for Orange Is the New Black. But she's got a plan for casting the upcoming Netflix series Social Distance, a scripted show set during the pandemic.  "I have to hire actors that are quarantining together as families, as husband and wife, as brother and sister, any combination of people — and it's not just straight couples," she says, adding that her goal is to add as much diversity to the show as possible. Not just racial and ethnic diversity, but "all shapes, and sizes, and faces, and looks." You lose a little bit of the fun and the magic of having everybody in the room together and seeing each other. But it's good to remember that we're all fortunate to be working. "Bob's Burgers" writer Lizzie Molyneux One Day at a Time executive producer Gloria Calderon Kellett found an alternative to taping her show on a crowded set in front of a live audience. After her rebooted sitcom had to shut down midseason, she had an idea: "My husband's a cartoonist, so animation is around me all the time. And I just thought maybe we can animate this particular episode." Kellett says the storyline of this particular episode, set to air in June, has her TV family dealing with the upcoming presidential election. She says it's filled with fantasy sequences, making it easy to animate, but future episodes won't necessarily be cartoons.  Animation is one of the few forms of entertainment still in production. For the series Bob's Burgers, animators in South Korea continue to work. And from their homes in Los Angeles, writers and sisters Wendy and Lizzie Molyneux work in the show's virtual writers' room. "You lose a little bit of the fun and the magic of having everybody in the room together and seeing each other," Lizzie Molyneux says. "But it's good to remember that we're all fortunate to be working." The Molyneux sisters are also co-executive producers of an upcoming animated sitcom, The Great North. The cast, which features the voices of Megan Mullally and Will Forte, recently tested out lines during an online table read. "Normally you get the big laughs from the room, but we had everyone other than our actors muted so there wouldn't be a lot of noise," Wendy Molyneux says. "But the actors were nice enough to laugh at the jokes themselves as it went along. So that helped it have the feeling of: We're not saying jokes into an absolute vacuum.'' TV writers are now wrestling with how future storylines can deal with the coronavirus pandemic and an unknown future. Schur says his showrunner wife, J.J. Philbin, is waiting to see if her sitcom, Single Parents, gets picked up for another season. "Her daily question is: 'When we come back, are these people living in this world?' Do you ignore it, or do you run right at it?" he says. "It's hard to know what people will want from TV, whether they'll want pure escapism or whether they'll want a sort of reflection of their own reality." Audiences may already be tired of watching actors in their living rooms or in mock Zoom meetings. Is it time to innovate new special effects or bring back canned laugh tracks? Stay tuned.

             Rosemary Ugboajah (at front) with her company's leadership team, Alan Tse and Sheri Ellis. The first time Rosemary Ugboajah applied for a small-business relief loan, it didn't go well. She needed the money for her small Minneapolis-based company, which has created ad campaigns for brands like the NCAA Final Four. So she went to her credit union. "They were hard to reach, but eventually I got through to someone and they emailed me back saying they can't process the loan because they don't process SBA loans," she said. "I wasn't aware of that." Lawmakers did set aside $30 billion for smaller lenders, in part with the aim of helping business owners of color — like Ugboajah. But a new report from the Small Business Administration's inspector general found that businesses owned by people of color may not have received loans as intended under the Paycheck Protection Program. There was no evidence, the report said, that the SBA told lenders to prioritize business owners in "underserved" markets, including business owners of color — something the CARES Act had specifically instructed the SBA to do. The report also recommends that the agency start collecting demographic information. Without that information for past loans, it will be hard to know how well the program served business owners of color. Some businesses owned by one person — such as some sole proprietorships, like Ugboajah's Neka Creative — were only allowed to apply for funds one week after other businesses. That put them in the back of the line to get the money, which ran out quickly during the first round. After trying and failing at two other banks, Ugboajah managed to find one that was accepting applications from new customers, and she quickly applied. But that also went poorly. "The next week, I got an email from them saying, you know, the money's running out. And they're now just going to prioritize their clients that have borrowed before," she said with a weary laugh. Ugboajah has applied there again during this second round of funding but hasn't heard back yet. But she could use the money, and fast — her team is currently working through the pandemic without pay. "We had a healthy pipeline coming into this year. And as soon as this came down, everything went on hold and then disappeared," she said. An additional problem for these owners is that their businesses are more likely to be sole proprietorships, according to Ashley Harrington, senior policy counsel at the Center for Responsible Lending. "When we're talking about businesses of color, most of them are very small businesses. So they're sole proprietorships or they have less than 10 employees or in fact more likely to be a sole proprietorship than any of the other small businesses," Harrington said. Ugboajah has six people on her team — and they're all contractors — making her business one of those one-person sole proprietorships. African American-owned businesses are particularly likely to be one-person firms. And relationships with banks matter, according to Michael Roth, managing partner at Next Street, which works with local governments on small-business policy. "Black- and Hispanic-owned businesses, because of their lack of access to capital from banks and financial institutions and friends and family, are far more likely to use personal funds to finance their businesses," he said. "And generally, that's run out of personal checking accounts." That could be a problem for some businesses in the program, because some banks would loan only to people with business accounts. So owners without those — who were, for example, running their businesses out of their personal accounts — were shut out. Ugboajah says that if she doesn't get the funding, it won't take her business down completely, but it could make life harder. "The main thing that we're on the verge of losing is our office space. But, yeah, we won't go out of business," she said. But it has already hurt the contractors who rely on her for income, she added: "One of my team members has taken a job with Amazon, for example. But we're still pushing to get business in." For now, she says, they're working on a new project: to make sure health information about the coronavirus can reach poor and immigrant communities, as well as communities of color.

             Republican U.S. House candidate Mike Garcia campaigns back in January, before California's stay-at-home order forced the candidates to campaign from home for Tuesday's special election. The first competitive congressional race of the coronavirus era takes place Tuesday in Southern California, where Republican Mike Garcia and Democrat Christy Smith are vying to fill the vacancy left by former Rep. Katie Hill, who resigned last year because of a personal scandal.  The winner will serve out Hill's current term through November, when the same two candidates will be on the ballot again for a full two-year term.

             The Democratic-leaning 25th District seat is a toss-up, with Garcia showing signs of strength in the closing weeks of the campaign.  The race has provided a snapshot of what stay-at-home orders and socially distanced campaigning could look like all across the country this year if the pandemic continues to disrupt the 2020 election season. California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom issued a stay-at-home order on March 19, forcing Garcia and Smith to abandon the pillars of traditional campaigning: door-knocking, meet-and-greets, rallies and fundraising events.  The candidates instead debated via live video conference call, and directed their campaign volunteers to do exclusive phone work.  "We transitioned from being able to canvass, and stand on street corners waving signs, and going out to events with Mike, like meet-and-greets and that sort of thing, to all phones," said Marian Salazar, a volunteer for the Garcia campaign.   Loading...  Smith told NPR the pandemic requires campaigns to also be able to offer constituents assistance, not just ask for their vote.  "We've made sure that all of our callers, as they're reaching out, are equipped with information like how to connect to state resources, the domestic violence hotline, mental health services or being able to connect people with their nearest food pantry," she said.  The race is also now a primarily mail-in ballot election that was ordered by the governor in response to the pandemic. Republicans, including President Trump, have criticized mail-in ballot elections as somehow unfair to the GOP, but nonpartisan elections analyst David Wasserman notes early data suggests a strong performance by Garcia in this Democratic-leaning seat.  "Republicans are more accustomed to using vote by mail, at least proportionately, in California, and so far what we've seen is that Republicans are leading Democrats by about 12 points on their return rate," he said. A Garcia victory could help temper GOP opposition to mail-in balloting as more states consider the option for November. On Friday, Newsom signed an executive order requiring a ballot to be sent to every registered voter in the state this November. The national campaign committees are using this race to test out different messages — sending different mailers and texts to different voters to see what gets the highest rate of response, according to Illinois Democratic Rep. Cheri Bustos, who runs the House Democrats' campaign operation.  "We'll see what works and we'll come out of that special election with ideas that will work going in to 2020," she said. Socially distanced campaigning has its drawbacks. Smith committed what is possibly the first Zoom gaffe of 2020 when she appeared to make light of Garcia's past military service as a Navy fighter pilot in an open online call with liberal supporters that was captured by Republican trackers. Smith apologized but Garcia quickly responded with an ad touting his military service in a district populated with military personnel and law enforcement officers.  The race is also a test of what kind of candidate appeals to voters during this pandemic. Garcia is the political outsider who wants to change the way Washington works. "I'm running because I don't want my nation to become what this state has become, which is a victim of poor policy and poor execution," he said at their lone debate, conducted via video conference.  Smith, who is currently a state representative, is the experienced hand in government. "I have 10 years of elected public experience, with balanced budgets, with effective policies," she said at the same debate. The race is considered to be evenly matched and if it's close the winner might not be known on Election Night because mail-in ballots can take longer to count — another preview of how November could play out.  Regardless of the outcome of Tuesday's special election, Wasserman says it does not change the overall forecast for control of the U.S. House in 2020. "Democrats are still likely to hold on to their majority even if they manage to lose this seat on Tuesday," he said.

             Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, speaks remotely Tuesday during a Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee hearing on the coronavirus. Updated at 2 p.m. ET Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, warned Tuesday of states and localities skipping over federal guidelines while trying to lift restrictions and restart their economies amid the coronavirus pandemic.  Speaking remotely during a unique Senate health committee hearing, Fauci told lawmakers that his concern is that if some areas "jump over" guidelines from the federal government and "prematurely open up," there will be "little spikes that turn into outbreaks." His statements follow an email he sent to The New York Times on Monday in which he wrote, in part: "If we skip over the checkpoints in the guidelines to 'Open America Again,' then we risk the danger of multiple outbreaks throughout the country. This will not only result in needless suffering and death, but would actually set us back on our quest to return to normal."   The White House guidelines, released in April, call for states or regions to see a downward trajectory of cases or positive tests over two weeks before moving on to a phased reopening.  Miss the hearing? You can watch it here. Fauci, who's director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a key member of the White House coronavirus task force, told lawmakers that this virus will not disappear.  "That is just not going to happen," he said.  Fauci implored states to "go by the guidelines" because otherwise, "the consequences could be really serious." He warned that "there is no doubt" that as mitigation efforts are pulled back, "you will see more cases." He said states have to remain prepared and ready to deal with more cases. Asked by Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts whether the virus is contained, he said it is not. "If you think we have it completely under control, we don't," Fauci said. "I think we are going in the right direction, but the right direction does not mean, by any means, that we have this under control."  Focus on schools When asked by committee Chair Lamar Alexander of Tennessee whether there would be coronavirus treatments or a vaccine that could facilitate college students returning to school in the fall, Fauci said he thought that "would be a bridge too far." 
                Some senators were in the briefing room for the hearing, while others and the four witnesses joined remotely.

             Some senators were in the briefing room for the hearing, while others and the four witnesses joined remotely. Alexander chaired the hearing remotely from his home in Tennessee (with his dog Rufus in the background on a couch the whole time) because one of his staffers tested positive for COVID-19. Fauci said there are multiple potential vaccines in development and that he hopes the administration will have some idea whether they work by late fall, early winter. Dr. and Adm. Brett Giroir, an assistant health secretary who is leading the Trump administration's testing efforts, said during the Senate hearing that there may be the possibility to test students going back to school by the fall. Also testifying Tuesday were Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Robert Redfield and Food and Drug Administration chief Dr. Stephen Hahn. All four witnesses testified remotely. Redfield in particular talked about contact tracing, and about how his organization is working with local officials to build up capacity to conduct tracing. Calls for more testing Giroir said that as of Tuesday, the United States has conducted more than 9 million coronavirus tests, more than any other country. He noted the importance of testing asymptomatic people, and that he expects the country to be able to do 40 million to 50 million tests a month by September. Chairman Alexander stressed the need for more widespread testing for the virus.  "All roads back to work and school go through testing," the Republican said in his opening remarks. Republican Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah came at the testing problem straight on. He noted that while it's nice that the U.S. has passed much-lauded South Korea in total testing, the real issue is when that testing took place. It took place far too late in the U.S., he said, to prevent the tens of thousands of deaths in this country, the way South Korea did by testing early.  "I find our testing record nothing to celebrate," Romney said. That's been the problem all along. President Trump downplayed the coronavirus for weeks, while South Korea was doing the bulk of its testing. Trump only seemed to take it seriously as the death toll went into the thousands in this country.  In recent days, Trump has again downplayed the importance of testing, but also said during a briefing at the White House on Monday that "we have prevailed" on testing. Asked when all Americans will be able to get tested every day, as often as officials in the White House are, Trump claimed: "Very soon. I mean, really, very soon." There is no evidence the country is close to getting everyone tested routinely. Later, Trump inaccurately said, "If somebody wants to be tested right now, they'll be able to be tested."  Trump and Giroir clarified Monday that everyone who needs a test can get one. And then, Trump added, "Not everybody should get a test, because they should have certain things when they're not feeling right." That's a remarkable statement considering that Vice President Pence's press secretary, Katie Miller, tested positive for COVID-19 — and displayed no symptoms. Fauci, Redfield and Hahn are currently self-quarantining because of exposure to a White House staffer who tested positive for the coronavirus.  Murray criticizes Trump administration Like Alexander, Patty Murray, who's the ranking Democrat, noted that what's needed in the country is "dramatically more testing," and yet, she said, there's no comprehensive plan to ramp it up and make it free.  Murray, of Washington state, a state that saw an early outbreak of the coronavirus, didn't mince her words about the Trump administration's response to the pandemic, calling it a "disaster all on its own." She cited "delays" and "missteps" that allowed "inaccurate antibody tests to flood the market," longer wait times for personal protective equipment for front-line health care workers and that Trump himself has "promoted dangerous, unproven treatments" and that his White House buried detailed CDC guidance for reopening.  "The Trump administration tossed it in the trash bin for being too prescriptive," Murray said, adding that it's "far from first time" that Trump has tried to "silence experts," and charged that Trump would rather fight "against the truth than this virus." Alexander said he wants the focus not to be on "finger-pointing" but on what to do for this pandemic going forward and others that could come in the future. "I'm not worried about what you do on Sunday, I'm worried about what you do the rest of the week," Alexander said in his opening remarks, quoting his preacher. Alexander said "before we spend too much time finger-pointing," consider that "all of us" underestimated this virus. "Even the experts underestimated COVID-19." At one point, Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul took aim at Fauci, saying he's not the "end all" when it comes to how to deal with the coronavirus.  Fauci, for his part, responded that he never made himself out to be the end all, that his advice is based on science and how to stop a pandemic, that he doesn't give advice about the economy, and that being "humble" is important — for everyone — when it comes to a novel virus that everyone is learning about in real time.

             Digital generated image of macro view of the corona virus from the 2020. Years ago, Markus Buehler developed a method to model proteins through music. So, when he heard about the spike proteins on the novel coronavirus, he wondered: what does it sound like?  Today on the show, Maddie Sofia talks to Short Wave reporter Emily Kwong about how Markus Buehler, a composer and professor of engineering at MIT, developed a way to make music out of protein structure and how music can potentially help us hear what we have trouble seeing at the nanoscale level.  Listen to the "protein sonifications" and other music created by Markus Buehler, featured in the episode: Close to Nature Concert of Silk and Amyloid Concert of Enzyme Lysozyme Viral Counterpoint of the Coronavirus Spike Protein (2019-nCoV) And here is a dance performance from Poland, choreographed to Buehler's coronavirus spike protein composition.

This episode was produced by Yowei Shaw, edited by Viet Le, and fact-checked by Emily Vaughn and Kimberly McCoy. Parents, let's be honest: Many of us are struggling right now.  Some have lost loved ones to COVID-19; many of us have lost jobs. And nearly all of us have spent the past two months juggling new parenting responsibilities as our children stay home and schools shift online.  In March, NPR's Life Kit team put together this guide to help parents navigate the tumultuous early days of the pandemic. But in the intervening weeks, the challenges have changed.  So we checked in with Rosemarie Truglio, a developmental psychologist and senior vice president of curriculum and content at Sesame Workshop, to gather wisdom you can use during this current phase.  (And Grover has some advice just for kids, here.) At the beginning of the pandemic, kids' questions were often easy enough to explain with a little science. What is COVID-19? Easy. How can we keep from getting it? There are no guarantees, but hand-washing works wonders!  Now, however, the top question in the minds of many kids — and adults — is, when will the coronavirus crisis end? And that one is mysterious and unexplainable. Still, it requires an honest answer, says Truglio, one that's hard for some parents to say: "I don't know." But don't stop there. Shift the conversation by asking, "What do we have control over now?" And then plan an activity that's fun, that your kids can look forward to and that you can control, pandemic be darned.  One example: Go camping — in a nearby state park, in your backyard or even in your living room. Pitch a tent, roast marshmallows (on the stovetop if you have to) and gaze up at the stars — even if you have to cut them out and tape them to the ceiling. What matters in this confusing, indefinite time, Truglio says, is that kids feel some sense of control and have something happy they can mark on the calendar. There have been so many great examples of families getting creative to mark milestones and special occasions — drive-by birthday parades, graduation yard signs, even a DIY trip to Disney World.  We all need to forgive our kids when they cross a line now and then. But you also need to forgive yourself if you don't always handle their misbehavior with the optimal amount of patience and grace. Most of us are not at our best right now, and that's OK.  "We're human beings, and we're going to lose it. All of us, even myself," Truglio says. For her, it was when she was working from home and her Wi-Fi went out. Her son tried to console her by giving her a hug, but what she really needed was some space.  To make sure we lose it less often, Truglio says, try to take a breather whenever you start to feel overwhelmed by a situation — just put a door between yourself and your child for a minute or two and practice some deep breathing. Also, be sure to recharge your batteries by scheduling a little me-time here and there; maybe it's watching your favorite show once the kids are in bed or taking a hot bath while another grown-up in the house looks after the kids.  If you've never tried meditation — or you've not made time for it lately — we can't recommend it enough. Even 10 minutes of quiet can do wonders for your pandemic-thinned patience.  (Here's a quick mindfulness tool that Life Kit recommends.)  But if you do lose it with your kids, Truglio says, the important part is that you model the process of making amends. Truglio went back to her son, apologized and got that hug after all.  Many of us feel torn and guilty as we try to balance our kids' needs with our bosses' demands. A lot of the time it feels like the only way out is to hand our young ones a screen. But Truglio says this is an opportunity to parent differently, in a way that equips our children with essential life skills.  "This is not a time for kids to think that they can have their parents' 100% attention," says Truglio. "It's so important for children to build what we call resiliency skills. And part of resiliency skills is to have them cope with disappointment and frustration."  It's OK to say, "I just can't be with you right now, and I trust you to figure this out." "Let kids have the space to be creative problem-solvers. Because when you remove yourself and have them be much more self-sufficient, they are developing these important critical thinking skills. You're empowering them to be problem-solvers."  These days, Truglio says, many kids are so reliant on the adults in their lives that "they're afraid to make a mistake because they think that mistakes are bad. And we need to flip the script on that as well and say, 'That's how you learn!' "  We've heard from many parents concerned that their children aren't learning enough in this time of emergency remote instruction. Teachers and school budgets are spread thin, and often, even the kids who are fortunate enough to have computers and access to Wi-Fi aren't getting more than an hour or two of instruction each day. To that, we say, focus on the things you can control. Truglio has some good news here: Our homes are already full of potential learning experiences. Cooking together, for example: "You have a literacy component because we're reading the recipes. We're reading ingredients. It's a math moment as we're measuring. It's a science moment as different substances are changing because of the properties of matter."  Board games — which we've explored before as a rich way to teach math — can also build kids' ever important social-emotional skills, helping them grapple with concepts of fairness, chance, strategy and practice. As lockdowns soften and rules change around the U.S., families might disagree about some things — like whether to get takeout or when to wear a mask.  This can be confusing for children. If your child sees other kids playing together in the park, for example, she may think you're being unfair — or even mean — for not letting her do the same.  When you explain, Truglio says, "it's about putting a positive spin on this: 'These rules are put in place by our family because we need to make sure that we're staying healthy.' " The more your child hears that these rules are about helping — that they are empowered to be helpers — the easier it will be for them to understand and ultimately embrace them. Truglio suggests something like, "'We need everyone in the family to do their part. And so this is why you're playing such an important role!'

             A pharmacist gives Jennifer Haller a shot in the first-stage safety clinical trial of a potential vaccine for COVID-19 on March 16 at the Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute in Seattle. U.S. officials say they are already seeing efforts by foreign actors to steal information from U.S. firms working on a vaccine and treatments for the virus. As researchers around the globe race to develop a coronavirus vaccine, U.S. authorities are warning American firms to exercise extreme caution in safeguarding their research against China and others with a track record of stealing cutting-edge medical technology. "We are imploring all those research facilities and hospitals and pharmaceutical companies that are doing really great research to do everything in their power to protect it," Bill Evanina, the director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center, said in an interview with NPR. "We don't want that company or the research hospital to be the one a year from now, two years from now, identified as having it all stolen before they finished it," said Evanina, whose center falls under the director of national intelligence. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security and Britain's National Cyber Security Center recently issued a statement saying hackers are "actively targeting organisations ... that include healthcare bodies, pharmaceutical companies, academia, medical research organisations, and local government." The statement did not name China or any other country. Reuters reported that hackers linked to Iran tried to break into email accounts at the U.S. drugmaker Gilead Sciences, which has a potentially promising drug to treat the COVID-19 virus. Iran denied the report. China's record Meanwhile, Evanina says China, far more than any other country, has been aggressively stealing valuable medical technology for years. Information on a possible vaccine would be a huge prize.  "We have full expectation that China will do everything in their power to obtain any viable research that we are conducting here in the U.S.," Evanina said. "That will be in line with their capabilities and intent the last decade plus, and we are expecting them to continue to do so." A number of drug makers, research labs and government health bodies have announced efforts to seek a vaccine or treatment for COVID-19. That's made them a target, FBI Deputy Assistant Director Tonya Ugoretz said recently. "We certainly have seen reconnaissance activity, and some intrusions, into some of those institutions," she said. "It kind of makes them a mark for other nation-states that are interested in gleaning details about what exactly they're doing and maybe even stealing proprietary information." China has long denied involvement in corporate espionage and has called for international cooperation to accelerate progress on COVID-19 vaccines and therapies. Beijing points to its sharing of the coronavirus' gene sequence as evidence of its sincerity. Meanwhile, Chinese labs say they are racing ahead to find a homegrown vaccine. President Trump and his administration have frequently criticized China for its handling of the coronavirus. Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have said the virus may have escaped from a lab in the central city of Wuhan. But they have not provided evidence, and this has led to skepticism about some administration claims regarding what has happened inside China in recent months. 'Made in China 2025' However, the U.S. national security community has shared a broad consensus for years about what they say is a sustained Chinese government effort to acquire, lawfully or not, a wide range of intellectual property, including medical research. U.S. officials often point to China's President Xi Jinping and his "Made in China 2025" plan, which calls for the country to be a world leader in the most important technologies of the 21st century — artificial intelligence, renewable energy, quantum computing, driverless cars and wide range of medical technologies. In the past couple years, the Justice Department has filed charges in multiple cases involving Chinese nationals or people suspected of working for China to steal medical technology, often involving cancer research. U.S. officials describe these efforts as taking several different forms. One is widespread and persistent hacking attempts directed at tech companies or research labs working on technology China has identified as important. A second method is sending students or researchers to work in the U.S., often for extended periods. In a case last year, the Justice Department filed charges against a Chinese couple that worked for 10 years at an Ohio lab that researches pediatric diseases, including childhood cancers. U.S. authorities accuse the couple of stealing research at the Ohio lab for use in a company the husband-and-wife team had established back in China. U.S. officials say a third path is China's Thousand Talents Program. China identifies promising research, often at a U.S. university, then offers funding through its Thousand Talents Program with the expectation it will get access to the research as well. U.S. academics are required to tell the U.S. government if they receive such foreign funding. Security briefings To combat the theft of U.S. technology, Evanina works with law enforcement and other government partners to brief company CEOs, university presidents and other leaders of organizations that are being targeted. This began several years ago, and includes senior leaders in the medical community. Sometimes they are called to Washington for a briefing where the organizations may also hear from Sen. Richard Burr, the North Carolina Republican who heads the Senate Intelligence Committee, and Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the ranking Democrat. "We provide (the organizations) a one-day classified briefing. We make sure they understand the complexity of the threat. We've done that for multiple sectors that include hospitals, medical centers and research institutions and the pharmaceutical community as well," said Evanina.

                "Essential," a poster design by Marvin Madariaga, is projected onto a hospital building in New York City. It was submitted to the arts group Amplifier's open call for pandemic art.

             It's an image of a nurse with her hands pressed together in prayer. In bold letters below her hands, it says "bless the healers." The illustration, designed by the artist Marvin Madariaga, has been shared across social media. Some people have posted it in the window of their home. And it's been projected on the side of a building in the heart of New York City. In health crises, people have long turned to the arts to inform and inspire. During the 1980s AIDS epidemic, the words "silence = death" were printed on posters, pins and patches. And during the 2014 Ebola crisis, murals with the slogan "Ebola is real" were painted across West Africa. The coronavirus pandemic is no different. Two organizations, the United Nations and Amplifier, an arts group, launched independent campaigns in March inviting artists to submit artwork around the coronavirus. Tens of thousands of submissions later, the groups are now showcasing a selection of these works to the public. Madariaga's artwork was submitted to Amplifier, which coordinated some of the iconic poster designs around the Women's March on Washington in 2016. "In times of uncertainty, art is more than beauty or decoration — it's a tool. Art can heal, art can save lives, art can bring us together — even when we're apart," says Aaron Huey, founder of Amplifier. "It can be a compass to guide us through the storm."

             In March, the U.N. put out an open brief, or request, calling on artists to produce "concise and impactful visuals to help share life-saving information on COVID-19." "The idea was really to try and lean into the creative community, to try and help identify, interpret, and amplify the messages that were keeping people safe," says Dawda Jobarteh of the U.N., who helped organize the campaign. Since then, it has received nearly 17,000 designs from artists in 143 countries, ranging from photography to animation, graphic design to hand-drawn posters. Some submissions focus on unity. In one, Mexican artist Lisa Saldivar depicts the facade of an apartment building, as a crowd of people converse. Bubble letters frame the piece: "kindness not cancelled."

             Other submissions, like one from Russian artist Irina Chaitsyna, emphasize important health messages.

Credit:  Fuzzco After the call for submissions ended on April 14, the U.N. evaluated the designs to ensure that they were promoting accurate health messaging according to the World Health Organization's safety guidelines. On April 30, it made the vetted images available in an online portal — and are now encouraging people to view the images, download and share. There is no cash prize, but the U.N. will feature some of the artwork on their social media channels. Amplifier's campaign had a slightly different brief. On May 8 it ended a campaign calling on artists to create visuals that promote mental health and well-being amid the pandemic. It also called for artwork that envisions life after lockdown.

             Since then, it has received over 10,500 submissions — with 100 entrants selected for a $1,000 individual cash prize. Like the U.N., selected images are also available on Amplifier's website for people to download for free and share. Amplifier is taking things a step further by turning some of the submissions into a series of public art installations in cities around the world, in partnership with the arts group The Illuminator. In addition to being projected onto a building in New York City, Madariaga's nurse poster also wallpapers a building on Oxford Street in London. Passersby are snapping photos of the installations and posting it to social media. "This is so dope," writes Instagram user @where_bry_at, of a projection depicting a black female health worker in a mask. "I love the message, the representation and the encouragement." Praising the efforts, Glen Nowak, director of the Center for Health and Risk Communication and a professor of advertising at the University of Georgia, says public art campaigns like these can help drive home important messages around a health crisis. He cites the AIDS Memorial Quilt as an example. First created in 1987, the quilt is a vast patchwork of more than 50,000 panels commemorating the lives of the epidemic's victims — while helping the public comprehend the reality of the crisis. Unlike other kinds of messaging, art is colorful, engaging and provocative, says Nowak. And for that reason, it "can grab people's attention" in a special way.

             President Trump takes questions during a news conference on the coronavirus in the Rose Garden of the White House on Monday afternoon. Updated at 7:44 p.m. ET  President Trump and Vice President Pence will be "maintaining their distance in the immediate future" on the advice of the White House Medical Unit, a senior administration official told NPR. They were last seen together at the White House on Thursday. At a Monday White House briefing, which the president attended but the vice president did not, Trump suggested that he might be keeping his distance from Pence for the time being. "We can talk on the phone," Trump said. Last week, the press secretary for Pence and a military valet for the president tested positive for the coronavirus. Pence and others who were in contact with the coronavirus patients have since tested negative, but the virus can take days to incubate. The cases have heightened concerns about the nation's ability to safely reopen. Still, despite the close proximity of the White House cases, Trump said on Monday that he felt "no vulnerability whatsoever" and still expected the U.S. to move swiftly toward reopening. "I want our country open. I want it open safely, but I want it open. Don't forget, people are dying the other route. You can go with the enclosed route — everything's closed up. You're in your house; you're not allowed to move. People are dying with that too," Trump said. Health experts have pointed to social distancing as one of the most key measures, alongside robust testing, to containing the virus and preventing new outbreaks. The White House convened the briefing to talk about the nation's coronavirus testing capabilities. Trump said the country was well prepared to test people as needed. Brad Smith, the deputy administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, said that the federal government has worked with each state to establish a testing goal for May of at least 2% of the population in each state, for a total of 12.9 million tests over the month. The briefing was cut short during reporters' questions after Trump told CBS News White House correspondent Weijia Jiang, who is Chinese American, that she "should ask China" why it was right for Trump to boast of the United States' testing capabilities. The exchange came after he berated a different newswoman for questioning why testing for White House employees was so abundant when ordinary Americans still struggled to easily find coronavirus testing. "If we did no tests in the White House, you'd be up complaining: 'Why aren't you getting tests for the White House?' See, we can't win," Trump said. "I understand you very well, better than you understand yourself," he told the reporter.  Trump has at several times during his presidency faced criticisms for aggressive confrontations with women and racial minorities. He has repeatedly referred to women with whom he disagrees in terms to disparage their physical appearance and mental capacity, including calling them "dogs," "horseface," "crazy," and even suggested that a woman's period was to blame for a disagreement. After last week's infections, the White House has now directed staff in the West Wing to wear masks while they are in the building, except when they are at their own desks, a senior administration official said. The most recent confirmed cases led to three members of the White House's coronavirus task force — National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony Fauci, Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Stephen Hahn and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Robert Redfield — moving to self-quarantine for two weeks. Trump's return to the podium came after he had previously signaled that he had soured on the once-daily briefings. What is the purpose of having White House News Conferences when the Lamestream Media asks nothing but hostile questions, & then refuses to report the truth or facts accurately. They get record ratings, & the American people get nothing but Fake News. Not worth the time & effort! However, as the nation moves to relax coronavirus restrictions and social distancing rules, the White House's COVID-19 cases have highlighted experts' concerns about possible new case spikes during the country's return to normal. Trump during Monday's briefing sought to assuage those concerns, push his desire to relieve the battered national economy and promote an image of personal health. "In the fourth quarter, we're going to do very good. And next year I think we're going to have one of the best years we've ever had because there is a tremendous pent-up demand," Trump said. Following the new coronavirus diagnoses last week, Trump announced that coronavirus testing at the White House would now be a daily undertaking for him and those closest to him, rather than weekly.

             At a distribution of donated food in the Kibera community in Nairobi, there was a stampede as residents rushed for the limited supplies, with several injuries resulting. "I am beginning to become a beggar," says Josephine Oguta. Oguta, 40, lives in Nairobi. Before the pandemic, she and her husband did not have financial worries. She was the breadwinner of the family – a teacher at a private nursery school in Kibera, a sprawling poor community in Kenya's capital city. Her husband, Zedekiah Okindo, was studying at a local institution in the hope of landing a government job. Now she's no longer able to work because of a nationwide school shutdown. And she says her husband sleeps most of the time in the house and looks stressed. With no source of income, Josephine and Zedekiah are struggling to feed their five daughters, ages 2, 8, 10, 20 and 22. The kids used to get three meals a day. Now, Oguta, says, she serves them porridge in the morning and a second meal of black tea and cooked rice. For people around the world, in both wealthy and low-income countries, fear of coronavirus goes hand-in-hand with anxiety about where the next meal is coming from. Like Oguta, many people who once could afford to buy enough food now find themselves lining up for food bank giveaways, borrowing money and food from friends – and cutting back on the number of meals they provide to their children. In Kenya, the government already has programs to transfer weekly cash payments to the needy via cellphones and is increasing this type of financial assistance for the newly unemployed; Agnes Kalibata, the U.N. Secretary General's Special Envoy for the 2021 Food Systems Summit, praises such efforts for "offering privacy and dignity in these tough times." Organizations are offering food as well – Shining Hope For Communities, a local charity in Kibera, is dropping off food at homes and asking the delivery person to take a photo to show that the donation reached the family (and didn't get siphoned off by local leaders). But the fear is that these temporary measures can't go on indefinitely. "It's a massive food crisis," says Kijala Shako, head of advocacy for Save the Children, who is based in Nairobi.  "The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the fragility of not only our health systems and economies but also our food systems," notes Kalibata. "My concern is that millions worldwide face months if not years of uncertainty over the next meal." We spoke to Josephine Oguta and two other Kibera residents to see the lengths they're going through to put food on the table. 'I humbly request for some cash — but for how long?' "I am a bit stressed up with how things are going, getting food is becoming an uphill task now that I am not earning any income from my teaching job," Oguta said in a telephone interview. Finding food is a constant challenge. In recent weeks, a close friend told Oguta about a planned distribution of food at the District Administration offices, provided by a well-wisher. The next day, Friday, April 10, she was among thousands of citizens who thronged the offices in hope of getting food supplies to feed her family. 
                Josephine Oguta is an early childhood development teacher at a nursery school in Kibera, a poor community in Nairobi. She is currently out of work as schools in Kenya remain closed because of the pandemic.

             "I was worried the previous night, I would oversleep and miss a chance to make it early enough with the hope of getting food donated to help ease the pangs of hunger at home," she says. Local leaders issued a limited number of cards to people who they believed would be in need of food – a measure to try and minimize crowds. Josephine was one of many residents who did not hear about the card system. "I was among the people who were locked out of the gate and a stampede followed as people became impatient for waiting for too long and not getting any access," says Josephine.  "I was very disappointed how the entire food distribution exercise was conducted, I got hurt in the process after being tightly squeezed among the pushing crowds," adds Josephine. She saw others who were injured – and got no food.  'People were shouting 'I am hungry, I am hungry give us food.' " At one point, the police to lobbed teargas canisters into the crowd to disperse the impatient throng. The next day, she had to take another tactic: asking a friend for a loan – 200 Kenyan shillings, the equivalent of about $2, to buy food for her family. "I have to flash [beep] friends with my phone from my church. When they call back I humbly request for some cash — but for how long?" she wonders. Her biggest worry is that her 2-year-old baby may end up being malnourished. Her prayer is that food drives should involve proper research, perhaps by door-to-door inquiries, to identify families in need, with the help of local leaders and elders. 'I feel weary not knowing where my next meal will come from' Steve Oludhe is another Kenyan who's new to the problem of hunger. The proud first-time father of a three-week-old baby girl, he usually works as a welder and earns about $25 a week – enough to pray rent and feed his family. But the shop where he works has been shut since mid-March. Since he stopped going to work, he's managed to make about $8 doing odd electrical jobs in people's homes. And with that drop in income, he is concerned about how to get the next meal for his wife, who is breastfeeding, and himself. 
                Everlyne Akeyo (left), and her husband Steve Oludhe are residents of Kibera. Steve worked as an electrician while his wife, who gave birth to a baby girl three weeks ago, had previously worked at a salon. Now he's out of work because of the coronavirus lockdown.

             "Even as we speak now, it's not good at all, I feel bad about this that I have to struggle where my next meal will come from," says Oludhe. "I feel tired and weary not knowing where my next meal will come from," says Oludhe. He missed out on a food distribution in Kibera, where he lives, because his wife had just been admitted to the hospital to give birth. At the moment he and his wife are getting by with one meal a day – typically ugali, a cornmeal dish similar to polenta, and kale. If they can afford it, they'll add black tea and mandazi, or fried bread,  Before the pandemic, he says, he and his wife had three meals per day with meat, beans and fish. He dreams of working again – and mentions that he had a chance to earn money in a nearby county fixing a generator but couldn't go because of the total lockdown in Kenya. 'I was earning an income ... now I am not able to'  Swaleh Juma, a 33-year-old father of three, is also having a share of struggles during the COVID-19 pandemic. His children, two boys, age 14 and 9, and a girl age 12, now only get two meals a day – rice, ugali and some cabbage or kale. Juma is self-employed and works as a garbage man, collecting trash from people's homes in Kibera for a fee they pay him. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, some residents asked him to stop collecting their litter fearing that he might infect them with the virus. 
                Swaleh Juma is a garbage worker who works a second job as a night security guard at a high school in Kibera.

             "I was earning an income from collecting garbage, but for now I am not able to, most people now throw their garbage out at night or early morning on their own in an irresponsible manner," says Juma during our phone conversation. His other hustle is working as a night guard for a local organization that runs a secondary school. But with schools closed, he can no longer work that job. His wife has lost the income she contributed to the family budget as well. "My wife washes clothes for people [in middle-class and upper-class neighborhoods]but now she cannot get any job coming her way. Those people fear slum people, and they say we shall transmit coronavirus to them," says Juma during our phone interview. His wish is that the government can be able to work out things to ensure people from low-income areas can get access to food during these tough times. And he hopes the pandemic ends soon: "If this continues, we may end up seeing an increase in crime-related activities, especially among the youth, who may be forced to seek other ways of survival."

                Some Smithfield Foods workers and their families have protested against the company's decision not to close a plant near Crete, Neb., amid the coronavirus pandemic.

             Thousands of meatpacking workers across the country were recently ordered back to work in plants that have seen massive outbreaks of COVID-19.  According to recent CDC data reflecting some states' outbreaks through the end of April, at least 5,000 workers have contracted the virus and 20 have died.  Other nonprofit organizations have reported many more.  President Trump's recent executive order hasn't stopped more plants from closing down due to COVID-19 concerns, but 14 are slated to reopen this week, spiking fears among some workers that they will inevitably catch the virus. And while Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue has promised the agency is "working round the clock" to implement OSHA's recent pandemic safety guidelines for meatpackers, many are concerned those policies don't go far enough to reduce the risk of transmission in plants nationwide. About a third of Crete, Neb., works at the sprawling Smithfield Foods plant just outside town. The meatpacking company is the area's largest employer — about 2,000 people normally process thousands of hogs per day at the plant into pork chops, bacon, and shoulder cuts for slow cooking. Both of those numbers have dwindled lately as the plant has struggled to contain its COVID-19 outbreak. Smithfield declined to confirm how many workers are now sick, but according to local health officials, more than 300 local cases are now tied to the plant. At least 1,000 meatpacking workers statewide have contracted the virus and three have died, but Nebraska Gov. Pete Ricketts will not allow the state to release any data regarding outbreaks at specific plants. Several Smithfield workers say the anxiety around going to work each day has become overwhelming. Many workers and their families feel caught between different tightwires of survival — staying financially afloat and protecting themselves from infection. For Angela Lopez, whose father works at the plant, the stress feeds into every area of her family's life.  "I just think that they should be more considerate for the workers," Lopez said. "Because for a lot of people, this is the only way that they can bring food to the table for their families, and it's not easy for them."  One Smithfield family recently said they've already lost a loved one after asymptomatic relatives unwittingly brought COVID-19 home from work." Many hoped the increasing outbreak would compel Smithfield to close the plant temporarily like at other locations in South Dakota and Wisconsin. And for a few hours recently, it seemed their wish came true: reports surfaced two weeks ago about an email sent to workers announcing a closure for sanitization. But hours after the plans leaked, Smithfield changed course, saying the plant would remain open on a half-day schedule. Around 50 employees walked off the production line after hearing the news. A few days later, after coping with another week of more sick coworkers and the lack of communication around the near closure, dozens of employees, advocates and their families felt they had no choice left but to protest pandemic conditions at the plant. In the age of COVID, that means weekly drive-by demonstrations. The group met for the first time a week ago outside a defunct Shopko downtown to paint slogans on their cars and review the driving route. The protest would follow a tidy loop around Crete, with stops at the Smithfield plant and Main Street: At first glance, the crowd could have passed for the Saturday grocery rush. David Desi Macias Jr., who's worked at the plant for 11 years, opted for a more personal message across his rear windows: "Our next breath may be our last." After two weeks out of work with COVID-19 and infecting his entire family, he wants the plant to follow through on its initial plans to close.  "All I'm looking for is a three- to five-day shutdown to clean and sanitize," he said. "They say safety's number one, and they care about us — then show us!" Then Macias Jr. joined a line of honking cars that snaked toward the Smithfield complex, where even more people — some who'd just clocked out, some as young as elementary age — hoisted themselves out of their sunroofs to waive homemade signs and chant: "You want meat? We want life!"  Yesenia Regalado jumped out of her car to waive a sign reading "PPE for all." She's been worried for weeks about the stories her mother and brothers keep bringing home — that they've only been given a face shield to protect themselves after initially having no protective gear at all, and aren't distanced from other workers on the line.  "I don't see how that's safe," Regalado said. "I wake up every single day thinking that it could be my mom, my neighbor, my friend's mom, my old friends...and I get it. Our parents are essential, but they're not dispensable." Smithfield Foods recently issued a statement addressing "misinformation" around criticisms of the company's COVID-19 policies, including allegations of insufficient PPE for workers. The company admitted it has struggled to source masks for workers ever since the CDC recommended workers start wearing them in early April. At that point, representatives wrote, masks were largely still being rationed for healthcare workers, and the hunt for PPE often led to dead ends. "Overnight, the need for masks and face shields was thrust upon us and the nation," representatives wrote. "Even today, we are struggling to keep inventories in stock. The suggestion that we were slow to react is simply not true and completely overlooks an inconvenient truth — supplies were not readily available." Though the company is now providing some PPE for staff, Eric Reeder's phone continues to ring with the voices of scared workers and their families. "I've literally had probably 25 or 30 calls from men and women calling, their children calling and crying, saying, 'I just can't take it,' because we don't know if they're going to get sick and die," he recalled. Reeder represents Smithfield Crete workers at Local 293 of the United Food and Commercial Workers, and has heard plenty about the alleged face shields being handed out. He considers those anecdotes evidence of where safety is still falling through the cracks at plants. "We've been asking for better protections and PPE," Reeder explained. "So they gave them disposable face shields and said, 'Well, we have to wear them all week.'" Plus, Reeder said, they scratch and dirty easily, which limits a worker's line of vision while running meat through a band saw or trimming cuts with sharp knives. "So what do you think is going to happen when you can't see your hands or where they're at?" He hoped the new OSHA guidelines for meatpackers would close those kinds of loopholes with stricter safety requirements and federal enforcement. But he thinks they merely encourage companies to adopt policies like screening for symptoms, expanding sick leave, and distancing workers.  "They made it mandatory for these workers to go to work and voluntary for the OSHA protections, which is just like putting a match to a powder keg," he said. Plus, Reeder is concerned their flexibility could complicate efforts to address workers' complaints going forward. Any labor disputes would normally be settled through mediation with the company — a process that's often drawn out over several weeks. "But in a case where people are dying in these plants, I don't have the luxury of filing a grievance and waiting for resolution two months down the road," he said. "I need to be able call an agency like OSHA and say, 'This plant's not following [these guidelines] and you need to get an inspector down here ... or threaten them with a fine so that they'll comply,'" Reeder said. Mark Lauritsen, who runs UFCW's national meatpacking division, agrees that the policies appear to strip companies of liability for not following best practices. In his view, that will affect workers differently based on which plants are or aren't unionized. "Regardless of what the OSHA [policies] or what this executive order says, our contracts still have language that provides for a safe workplace, and we're going to exercise those contractual rights to the fullest extent," Lauritsen explained. "In the non-union setting, it's gonna be a signal to run your plants however you want to run them." Some workers without unions behind them are already struggling to hold plants accountable due to the new federal guidelines. An anonymous worker at a Smithfield plant in Milan, Mo., recently tried to sue the company alongside a local advocacy group for not adequately addressing worker safety at the plant.  U.S. District Judge Greg Kays dismissed the lawsuit nearly two weeks later, citing the allegations were ultimately for OSHA to investigate, and that deferring to their judgement "will ensure uniform national enforcement" of the agency's meatpacking policies. Kays added the plant, which has no publicly known cases of COVID-19, has taken "significant steps" toward implementing safety measures per OSHA's guidelines and thus poses no obvious risk of "irreparable harm" to its employees.  "The Court is not unsympathetic to the threat that COVID-19 presents to the plant's workers," Kays added. "But in conducting its analysis, the Court must determine whether Plaintiffs will suffer an actual, imminent harm if the injunction is denied. This is not the same as analyzing whether employees risk exposure if they continue to work, and, unfortunately, no one can guarantee health for essential workers — or even the general public — in the middle of this global pandemic."This year got off to a busy start for Daphne and Alex. After almost five years together, they got married. Daphne was training for a new job at a local theater in Colorado. Alex was juggling gigs as a motion-graphics freelancer and a barista.  When the coronavirus hit, they found themselves among the millions suddenly jobless. Compounding this bad news was an unexpected anxiety: Is it safe to apply for unemployment?  "We were just wondering for a long time ... how is it going to affect the green card application?" Alex said.  "Immigration-wise, I just don't know if it would hurt me," Daphne said.  Alex is American, but Daphne is from Germany. NPR is using only their first names because they are waiting for the U.S. government to decide whether to grant Daphne a green card. This piece of paper would turn her from a temporary visitor — a foreign student — into a permanent resident, extending her right to work and live with her husband in the United States. Theirs were among a half-dozen stories NPR gathered about legal immigrant workers, people earning a living and paying taxes in the U.S. yet fearful that collecting unemployment might jeopardize their immigration cases. Some were waiting on their first green cards; others were extending their residency or were even on the verge of becoming citizens. "What I'm seeing is a lot of clients who are eligible to apply for unemployment are simply too afraid to do so," said New York-based immigration lawyer Tsui Yee. "Does [unemployment] somehow trigger a red flag for immigration services? Since COVID started, that question has come up repeatedly." At the heart of these worries is a new Trump administration policy, often called the "public charge" rule, which made it more difficult for immigrants to gain permanent resident status if it looks like they may need public assistance.  "I am tired of seeing our taxpayers paying for people to come into the country and immediately go onto welfare and various other things," President Trump said while discussing the new rule in August. But unemployment is not welfare. It's insurance, the costs of which are covered by workers and employers, not taxpayers. A spokesman for the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services told NPR that unemployment is an "earned benefit" that isn't considered for the public charge review.  In fact, the public charge rule is not written to apply for green card renewals or citizenship applications, immigration lawyers said. Yee encouraged worried workers to consult resources from groups such as the National Immigration Law Center or immigration attorneys, some of whom offer free consultations that might cover most of their concerns. "The perception is the problem, not the reality," said Allen Orr, an executive at the American Immigration Lawyers Association. "The law has become so complex that — first, there's a financial barrier of seeing an attorney. And then in the [news], you constantly hear you're not welcome." Perception ran away from reality as the Trump administration consistently sought to restrict immigration, making big changes to rules. Immigrant workers point out that many things that didn't count against them before now do.  "I'm not applying for unemployment. I don't want that right now," said Rita, who's been working in California as a permanent resident for several years. Like many, Rita and her spouse both lost work in the pandemic. "I'm telling you, I'm scared." Rita came to the U.S. from Guatemala to study film and acting. NPR is using only her first name because she is waiting on a renewal of her green card, hoping to apply for citizenship. And she said she's worried that collecting unemployment will look bad — like she's asking America for money. "I prepared myself and I came here legally," she said, her voice swelling. "I'm not here to take advantage of anything."

             A large screen broadcasting an evening newscast along a Beijing street in March shows Chinese President Xi Jinping wearing a protective mask during his visit to Wuhan earlier in the day. In early February, China's ruling Communist Party was facing one of its biggest political crises in more than three decades. A rapidly spreading outbreak of the new coronavirus was a "massive risk and challenge" to social stability, Chinese President Xi Jinping warned top party officials in an internal speech that was later published publicly. But with new domestic infections near zero, China has claimed victory over a virus that much of the world is still struggling to curtail. Newly confident and sensitive to criticisms that it initially covered up the outbreak, China's leadership is now seeking to recast the pandemic as a political win by arguing that its centralized, top-down governance system made it uniquely well-suited for containing and managing the virus; according to official figures, the virus has claimed fewer than 5,000 Chinese lives. "The way the Chinese handled the coronavirus is coupled with technology, with culture and with very effective government coordination," said Wang Huiyao, president of the Beijing-based think tank Center for China and Globalization. "That's something unthinkable in Western countries." Emboldened, China has also taken a bellicose, sometimes-threatening approach to countries that are critical of its response to the coronavirus. China has pressured European Union officials to tone down or outright remove language describing disinformation that Beijing put out during the pandemic — a story The New York Times first reported. On Twitter, Chinese diplomats have lashed out at those criticizing China's handling of the pandemic. 2/2 CDC was caught on the spot. When did patient zero begin in US? How many people are infected? What are the names of the hospitals? It might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan. Be transparent! Make public your data! US owe us an explanation! pic.twitter.com/vYNZRFPWo3 China has been especially aggressive in countering a narrative pushed forth with no evidence by senior U.S. officials, including President Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, that the virus originated — perhaps accidentally — in a laboratory in the Chinese city of Wuhan. Scientists, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, the U.S. government's top infectious disease specialist, say the novel coronavirus probably developed in nature. "The sole purpose for some U.S. politicians trying to fool others with their obvious lies is to shift the blame of their own incompetence," a Foreign Ministry spokesman said last month. China's state broadcaster recently released a satirical cartoon video depicting Lego characters representing China and the U.S., with America's Statue of Liberty making contradictory statements and throwing insults as China's mask-wearing terra cotta warrior patiently explains. "One of the most striking elements of Chinese diplomacy at this particular time is just how undiplomatic it's been," said Elizabeth Economy, Asia director at the Council on Foreign Relations. When Australia joined the U.S. in demanding an investigation into the origins of the virus in China, Hu Xijin, the outspoken editor-in-chief of the Global Times state tabloid, likened Australia to "chewing gum stuck on the sole of China's shoes. Sometimes you have to find a stone to rub it off." "You do not know how aggressive, how unreasonable the West can be in making up their fictions," Hu told NPR. A colorful provocateur who supports his country's more aggressive diplomacy, Hu justified China's more hawkish behavior as a natural response to American aggression. "China is getting better and better, while the future success of the U.S. is not assured," said Hu. "When the U.S. continually attacks China, mocks China, can you expect us to say nothing?" While striking a more combative tone may have found support among its own more nationalistic citizenry, Beijing may not have expected the global backlash it is now encountering. Faulty Chinese medical products, including face masks, have led some European countries to reject medical donations from China. Racism against thousands of Africans living in China's southern city of Guangzhou has wiped out much of the goodwill Beijing built up on the African continent. Several American lawmakers have argued that the U.S. should waive China's sovereign legal immunity; that would allow at least two states suing China for damages from the coronavirus to proceed to court. China has shifted blame by accusing the U.S. military, without providing evidence, of first bringing the virus to Wuhan when it competed in sports games last October. The claim has gained traction on the mainland. Zhao Lijian, a Foreign Ministry spokesperson known for his bellicose Twitter presence, has suggested several times that the coronavirus did not originate in China. State media outlets have repeatedly accused the U.S. of downplaying the severity of its outbreak. "We think Americans came to the Wuhan seafood market in October when there were military sports games being held in Wuhan," said one former vendor at the Wuhan market where the first cluster of human coronavirus cases was reported. The seller would not use his name because he wants to open a new store and does not want to be associated with the market. "The Americans are behind it all," he said.

             Known for his bellicose Twitter presence, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian has suggested several times that the coronavirus did not originate in China. Behind China's hostile rhetoric is a strong sense of aggrievement that other countries have overlooked its role in containing the coronavirus pandemic. "People in China feel a sense of pride because they had to sacrifice and that the leadership in the [Chinese Communist] party led them in an effective way," said Susan Shirk, a former deputy assistant secretary of state who's now chair of the 21st Century China Center at the University of California, San Diego. Others sense a more nefarious purpose behind the China bashing. "The ultimate purpose behind fanning the flames for racial discrimination and assigning responsibility is to demonize China and suppress China's rise," wrote Lin Yueqin, a scholar at the state-run Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, in April. Ultimately, what may be driving Chinese leaders' strident messaging is less a desire to impress other countries and more one to reassure its own citizens that China is standing up to American criticism. "Either the Chinese diplomats are delusional, or they are simply doing their very best to prevent the international narrative from seeping into domestic Chinese discourse and undermining the legitimacy of the Chinese Communist Party. And I would wager that the second is probably more likely than the first," said Economy, of the Council on Foreign Relations. While assigning blame might score points with populist elements in both China and the U.S., it comes at a cost for an important geopolitical relationship. "The epidemic at home was a real domestic crisis for the party leadership, and I think they've gone into overdrive to shore up domestic support," said Shirk, who is writing a book titled Overreach, about Chinese politics and diplomacy. "But what's happened is they're overdoing it in a way that's causing this international backlash against them. So it's very counterproductive." Instead of collaborating on a global health crisis, the two countries are now even further apart, according to U.S.-China relations experts. "The situation has decayed so much that to turn things around now and restore the level of international trust that China had previously enjoyed is all but impossible. It would be a challenge for even the most talented, cultivated and practiced diplomats," Zi Zhongyun, a widely respected scholar of U.S.-China relations at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, wrote in late April. The voices of reason are increasingly being censored and silenced in China, leaving only those at the extremes of the political spectrum, Zi lamented. "And as for the ignorant and the shameless online thugs," she wrote, "well, they get a free pass."

             President Trump has not approved FEMA funding for legal help for Americans affected by the coronavirus. Disaster Legal Services are usually available to survivors of disasters. Unprecedented job losses and furloughs have pushed millions of Americans to the brink of eviction during the coronavirus pandemic, but the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the White House have failed to fund a legal assistance program that is routinely available to disaster survivors. After hurricanes, wildfires and other disasters, including recent tornadoes in Tennessee, the president has directed FEMA to provide money for legal hotlines in affected areas. The hotlines are run through a partnership with the American Bar Association, which provides local attorneys to work for free. The federal government pays up to $5,000 per hotline to cover operational costs such as phone equipment and software. The Disaster Legal Services program is part of a larger suite of FEMA benefits known as individual assistance, which the governors of at least 30 states have requested in connection with the pandemic. But the White House has not approved those requests. The missing funding becomes more pressing every day because, unlike most weather disasters, the pandemic is causing long-term economic destruction. More than 33 million Americans have filed for unemployment in the past seven weeks. Temporary bans on evictions will likely expire in many cities beginning later this month, and families that delayed questions of custody, divorce or even intimate partner violence amid the growing pandemic will need help settling those issues as courts reopen. "I think this will be the biggest legal aid crisis we will face in my lifetime," says Laura Tuggle, the executive director of the nonprofit Southeast Louisiana Legal Services, who has also provided legal assistance in the region after hurricanes Katrina, Rita, Gustav and Ike, as well as the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Congress included $50 million in legal aid funding in the March 28 coronavirus relief bill, but that money has already been distributed to more than 130 legal aid groups around the country that are struggling to meet demand. "Now is the time," for FEMA to make legal services funding available, Tuggle says. "Frankly, I think every community in the United States is going to be in the same boat. It's an all-hands-on-deck situation." The delay in legal services help adds to the emerging picture of FEMA as fumbling the federal pandemic response. In March, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo accused the agency of driving up prices for crucial materials and failing to supply the state with an adequate number of ventilators. As the pandemic spread across the country, a team of volunteers working under President Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, sought to direct FEMA contracts to politically connected Republicans, according to The New York Times. FEMA says state requests for individual assistance are "under review." "The approval of programs in response to a disaster declaration request is made at the discretion of the president," a FEMA spokesperson wrote in an email to NPR. The White House did not respond to questions from NPR. Craig Fugate, who served as FEMA administrator during the Obama administration, says it is up to the president to make legal assistance funding available. "If disaster legal services were activated it would help those folks who cannot otherwise afford legal services," Fugate says. "You just think, with all of the deaths we've seen, families are going to have to start thinking about probating estates [and] wills, and all of the other legal ramifications that come when we lose a loved one." Illness and eviction Eviction is one of the most widespread legal issues that Americans face as a result of the pandemic, and losing access to housing can have profound public health implications. In New Orleans, sanitation worker Bobby Parker says he went from working 80 hours every two weeks to working 32 hours, and when he was late paying rent on April 1 his landlord changed the locks on his apartment. Parker is HIV-positive and his medications were locked inside. "I'm at-risk," he says. "I was scared." A city case worker already assigned to help Parker access public benefits connected him to a lawyer at a local legal aid group. It took more than two weeks and the threat of a lawsuit, but the lawyer was able to get the landlord to let him back into the apartment. While he was locked out, Parker alternated between sleeping outside and staying with a friend whose wife sometimes worked overnight shifts. Parker says if he hadn't had a lawyer, "I'd probably be a victim, testing positive for COVID-19." Without FEMA funding, most states have been unable to offer legal hotlines, making it more difficult for people to get the type of help the New Orleans resident received. The FEMA-funded hotlines connect callers with pro bono lawyers, who often refer clients to local legal aid groups. In Cleveland, where the outbreak has been relatively small, legal aid attorneys have nonetheless seen a surge in demand because so many people have lost jobs and are struggling to pay rent and bills. In New York City, local lawyers say they've seen a massive influx of requests including calls from essential employees who have been illegally locked out of their apartments, workers who need help paying for food, and emergency and retail workers desperate to draft wills and other documents in case they die of COVID-19.

             Residents affected by Superstorm Sandy wait outside a FEMA tent in 2012. FEMA has made disaster legal services available after past disasters, including Sandy and hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria. "Our calls for public benefits assistance increased by 150% compared to the four weeks prior to the crisis," says Raun Rasmussen, the executive director of the legal aid group Legal Services NYC. He expects that when courts reopen, "there's going to be an explosion of need as things start opening up in the next few weeks and months." FEMA-funded legal hotlines would help meet that demand. But only three states — Texas, Michigan and Nebraska — have been able to activate their statewide legal hotlines this spring, according to the American Bar Association. "We have a handful of state partners that we work with that are very well equipped to respond to disasters, and they have hotlines that they can easily switch on," explains Linda Anderson Stanley, the director of the Disaster Legal Services program at the association. But many states have not experienced a disaster that warranted a legal hotline for 10 years or more, "and they don't have the capacity or the funds to just flip a switch and turn on a hotline." One stark indication of the demand for legal help comes from states that have experienced other natural disasters during the pandemic. After tornadoes in Tennessee and earthquakes in Puerto Rico this spring, the White House and FEMA approved individual assistance connected to those disasters. Legal hotlines were activated on a limited basis for affected communities. But Stanley says the vast majority of calls to those hotlines weren't about the natural disasters. Instead, people call with questions about the coronavirus pandemic. When Congress isn't enough In late March, Congress appropriated $50 million in extra legal funding in its coronavirus relief bill. "What Congress has, in my view, correctly determined, is that legal services are very helpful in both the response to and recovery from natural disasters," says Ron Flagg, the president of the Legal Services Corporation, the nonprofit that distributes the funds to local legal aid societies. Flagg says the money Congress has made available so far is helpful, but not nearly sufficient to meet the growing need for coronavirus-related legal help. The Legal Services Corporation has already distributed virtually every dollar and has asked Congress to allocate another $50 million in the next relief bill. Flagg and others point out that congressional appropriations are generally paired with FEMA legal funding. After hurricanes and wildfires in 2017 and 2018, Congress twice appropriated $15 million in extra legal aid funding, while FEMA funded legal hotlines in areas affected by the same disasters. Stanley of the American Bar Association says it is frustrating to still be waiting for FEMA funding. "By now I expected there to be a change," she says. "We're really struggling to figure out where the breakdown is."

In March, photographer Neha Hirve moved from Sweden back to her childhood home in Pune, India, where she had grown up with her grandparents. It had been more than a decade since she'd lived in the country of her birth.  Shortly after Hirve's arrival, as the coronavirus started to spread around the country, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced an unprecedented 21-day nationwide lockdown in the world's biggest democracy. Hirve says it was a "very unusual way to process a homecoming."  "Political tensions are high but largely invisible," the photographer says, and they have created a "pressure cooker of emotions."  "Meanwhile, in the gated community we live in, the world feels very quiet," she continues. "We know from the news about the crisis going on outside, the reports of police brutality, political tensions. But inside, we see very little of the chaos in the rest of the country."

It's a contrast to her usual subject matter, which has ranged from environmental activists occupying an ancient forest in Germany to the storm chasers of America's Tornado Alley.

"During the weeks of the lockdown, I began to feel the fragility of my grandparents and of my childhood memories of them. The pandemic has made me look at them in a different light and come to terms with their mortality," Hirve says.  "I think of all those who are staying away from their loved ones to protect them, and I feel lucky that I get to keep them close for now. This project comes from a place of trying to capture the fleetingness of the everyday." The political tensions, while not directly present in this work, influenced the way she approached the photographs.  "I  responded to the uneasiness and fear I felt by grasping onto signs and symbols," she says.  The close-ups and exploration of details serve as mementos of the family and home that once was and that now is: details of flowers, hands touching, a thermometer displaying a high temperature, her grandmother's eyes looking into the distance, birds flying free and nature continuing its march forward.

             Dee Dee Bridgewater is a member of a new group called the Jazz Coalition. It seeks to pay out-of-work jazz musicians to produce new music while they're unable to gig. The cancellation of so many of the summer's live music events and festivals has been devastating for almost all musicians, but particularly for jazz artists who rely on touring venue over record sales and whose art is improvisational. A new group, called the Jazz Coalition, is looking to help. "Many jazz musicians have no other sources of income," Brice Rosenbloom, one of the founders of the Jazz Coalition says. "We feel it's vital to remind musicians of their value and worth as creators, so we're launching the commission fund initiative to keep musicians working." Around this time, Rosenbloom would usually be organizing this year's installment of New York City Winter Jazzfest. But now, he's re-directed his focus towards raising money for struggling musicians with the Jazz Coalition's Commission Fund. Here's the idea: Donors give $100 or more, and can nominate a musician to potentially win a $1,000 commission. Then, a committee decides who gets the money, and names a winning artist who is tasked with creating a musical piece. "We're asking artists to create a piece that is reflective of the times," Rosenbloom says. "The real goal here is that we're going to create a canon of new work that really represents our collective resilience and that can inspire and move us forward." Grammy award-winning jazz singer Dee Dee Bridgewater is a member of the Jazz Coalition, and she thinks the fund is a great way to help musicians get through this time. "It's healthy. It makes them feel worthwhile," she says. "And it could be the spark that that musician needs to move beyond this one piece." Rosenbloom says the grants won't necessarily replace lost income from live performance, but can help out-of-work musicians continue to work on their art. "We certainly are confident that it's going to boost morale and inspire them to keep working," he says.  Rosenbloom says the group has already raised over $70,000.The Healing Power of Human Connection in a Sometimes Lonely World by Vivek H. Murthy, M.D. Hardcover, 326 pages | Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How? When Dr. Vivek Murthy was surgeon general of the United States during the Obama administration, he went on a listening tour of America: He wanted to hear firsthand about people's health concerns. That meant addressing opioid addiction, diabetes and heart disease. And one more thing — something he wasn't really prepared for — the number of Americans suffering from a lack of human connection. Loneliness, he learned, was impacting them not only mentally but also physically. "I found that people who struggle with loneliness, that that's associated with an increased risk of heart disease, dementia, depression, anxiety, sleep disturbances and even premature death," he told NPR. It's a subject he writes about in his new book, Together: The Healing Power of Human Connection in a Sometimes Lonely World. On finding that loneliness is at the root of so much emotional and physical pain I heard many familiar stories about substance use and addiction, stories about depression and anxiety. But what I didn't expect was that behind so many of their stories were threads of loneliness. And people wouldn't say to me, "I'm lonely," but they would say things like this: "I feel like I have to shoulder all of these burdens by myself"; "I feel if I disappear tomorrow, no one would even notice." And I heard this time and time again. It was like a lightbulb went off. And I saw in the research that loneliness was far more common than I had thought, affecting 22% of adults in America. And it was deeply consequential. On the word "shame"  There's a tremendous sense of shame that people who are lonely feel. I say that as someone who felt ashamed of being lonely as a child and even at points during adulthood. I think part of the reason is that saying you're lonely feels like saying you're not likeable, you're not lovable — that somehow you're socially deficient in some way. The reality is that loneliness is a natural signal that our body gives us, similar to hunger, thirst. And that's how important human connection is. Thousands of years ago, our ancestors knew this. They knew there was safety in numbers. And when we were separated from each other, it places our survival at risk. And it puts us in a physiologic stress state, which, when it's short, when it's acute, it can lead us to seek out connection. But when it's prolonged, then it can become a chronic state of stress, which leads to inflammation in our body, damages tissues in blood vessels and, ultimately, damages our physical, as well as our emotional, health. On measuring loneliness I do think that we can impact how people feel about themselves and others. And more importantly, I think each of us as individuals can take certain steps in our own life — our connection to other people really begins with our connection to ourself. If we approach other people understanding our own value, being confident in who we are, being centered and grounded, it's actually easier for us to connect with them because we can listen more deeply and we can express ourselves more authentically without fear of being judged or not being enough. On the long-term effects of our self-isolation at this moment I think this could take us down one of two paths. One path is the worrisome one, marked by greater loneliness as we spend more and more time physically separated from one another. But the other path is the path of social revival, if we recommitted to people and to relationships. We have the opportunity to use this moment to recenter our lives on people. And if we do that, then I believe we can come out of this pandemic more connected, more fulfilled and more resilient than before the pandemic began.

             After testing positive for COVID-19, Diana Berrent established Survivor Corps, a grassroots clearinghouse for COVID-19 survivors interested in donating blood plasma to organizations developing therapies that might combat the disease. Diana Berrent learned she had tested positive for COVID-19 on a Wednesday in mid-March. Within a day, she had received 30 emails from people urging her to donate blood. Friends and acquaintances, aware of her diagnosis, passed along a pressing request from New York's Mount Sinai Health System, one of the first centers to seek plasma, a blood component, to be used in a therapy that might fight the deadly disease. Berrent, 45, said she immediately recognized the need for the precious plasma — and the demand that would follow. "When I saw that email going around, I saw what was going to happen in the landscape," said Berrent, a photographer and mother of two who lives on Long Island. She went on to found Survivor Corps, a grassroots clearinghouse that connects people who have recovered from COVID-19 with organizations eager to collect their blood. "What I saw was going to emerge was a free market where survivors were a commodity." Nearly two months later, Berrent's prediction is coming true. The coronavirus has infected more than 1.2 million people in the U.S., and now government scientists, academic researchers and for-profit pharmaceutical firms all are scrambling for blood plasma from COVID-19 survivors in hopes of developing a range of potential treatments. In Minnesota, a program coordinated by the Mayo Clinic has collected plasma from more than 12,000 COVID survivors for transfusion into more than 7,000 gravely ill patients, the result of a massive public appeal led by government leaders and nonprofit groups such as the Red Cross. Meanwhile, for-profit companies that typically pay $50 per donation of plasma used in other lifesaving therapies are advertising aggressively — and significantly bumping up their rates for COVID donors. In Utah, John and Melanie Haering, who contracted COVID-19 aboard the ill-fated Diamond Princess cruise ship, received gift cards worth $800 after making two donations apiece at a Takeda Pharmaceuticals' BioLife Plasma Services center. BioLife runs several of the more than 800 paid-plasma collection sites in the U.S., part of an industry that produces plasma protein therapies used to treat rare, chronic conditions such as hemophilia and in medical emergencies.

             Melanie and John Haering contracted COVID-19 on the Diamond Princess cruise ship. BioLife, a paid plasma collection site, gave them gift cards totaling $800 for donations of their blood plasma. "Given the urgency and importance of collecting convalescent plasma from the small population of recovered COVID-19 patients, BioLife is currently offering an added incentive for the first two donations from recovered COVID-19 patients," Takeda spokesperson Julia Ellwanger said in an email. The money was a nice surprise for the Haerings, though they said they were motivated more by the opportunity to prevent others from suffering. "If we could help anybody, we'd go every day," said John Haering, 63, a retired railroad manager who spent two weeks in a hospital in Japan after testing positive for the virus. Donors such as Berrent and the Haerings are needed to supply the building blocks of potentially lifesaving treatments. Rich with antibodies, convalescent plasma from COVID-19 patients is being tested as a possible therapy to promote recovery in people who are critically ill with the disease. It's also being collected to create a concentrated antibody serum known as hyperimmune globulin that may prevent or halt infection in the future. Similar products are used to treat rabies and illnesses such as infant botulism. If plasma from COVID-19 donors is shown to halt disease, coming up with an antidote could offer companies the prospect of making millions of dollars. And there's the possibility of a third treatment, monoclonal antibody therapy, which would use antibody-producing cells from high-antibody donors to create lab-produced molecules to fight the disease. All three therapies are promising, but all three require human blood plasma, said Dr. Michael Busch, a professor of laboratory medicine at the University of California, San Francisco and director of the Vitalant Research Institute, one of the largest blood center-based transfusion medicine research programs in the United States. "At some level, they're all competing with the regular blood banks like mine," Busch said. Only a fraction of those infected with COVID-19 have recovered sufficiently to donate, though more are eligible every day. But as demand for donors has grown, so has the need to wrangle the supply, ensuring that competition for plasma doesn't undercut the larger mission, said Dr. Michael Joyner, who heads the Mayo Clinic program. "We're going to get it all worked out," he said. "It's in everybody's enlightened self-interest to do this in an intelligent way." To avoid what Joyner described as a "range war" for COVID-19 plasma, he's spearheading an effort that calls for unprecedented collaboration to distribute separate streams of plasma among producers of therapies in a global market estimated to reach $35.5 billion by 2023. "It's like the oil market," he said. "You send oil that needs one type of refining to one market and oil that needs another type of refining to another market." His plan — floated last month to a group that included representatives from philanthropic organizations along with executives from for-profit and nonprofit blood collectors — relies in part on blood plasma from up to 10,000 Hasidic women in New York City, where the Orthodox Jewish community has been hit hard by the disease. Tens of thousands of people have fallen ill with the virus in the city's Hasidic neighborhoods, and more than 700 have died. In recent weeks, thousands of men in the community who have recovered from COVID-19 have rushed to donate plasma. Chaim Lebovits, who has helped organize the effort, said the donations are an act of faith. "We have an obligation to protect and save lives," Lebovits said. So far, however, many women in the Hasidic community have been unable to participate. Hasidic families are often large, and women who have had several children may have high levels of certain antibodies that are sometimes produced during a pregnancy. Rarely, such antibodies can cause a dangerous reaction — transfusion-related acute lung injury — in some recipients of plasma from women who have been pregnant. In COVID-19 patients, battling a virus that targets the lungs, such reactions could be deadly. Given the risk, many Hasidic mothers who want to join the men in donating have been deferred from providing plasma for immediate transfusion, the Mayo Clinic's Joyner said. But those women could be an ideal and ongoing source of plasma for hyperimmune globulin, which is processed in a way that dilutes or removes the antibodies. Roughly 10,000 women could donate up to four times each — generating some 30,000 liters of plasma from people who have recovered from COVID-19 that could be directed to the for-profit collectors to make hyperimmune globulin, Joyner estimated. That's enough for the companies to get started. "This is the basis of a true win-win," Joyner said. In the future, other groups deemed ineligible to provide convalescent plasma for transfusion, out of concern about disease transmission, could be diverted for hyperimmune globulin creation, he said. One key part of the plan will be the ability to identify eligible donors through antibody tests, Joyner said. Mayo Clinic scientists have already conducted more than 5,000 serology tests and identified hundreds of potential plasma donors. So far, however, neither the nonprofit organizations nor the for-profit firms have agreed to the plan. "Ways to facilitate these donations and recommendations for how to allocate donors to one donation stream or the other are still in progress," said Natalie de Vane, a spokesperson for CSL Behring, a biopharmaceutical company based in King of Prussia, Penn. CSL has joined with Takeda, a Japanese pharmaceutical company, to lead the CoVIg-19 Plasma Alliance, a coalition of six companies developing a single, unbranded hyperimmune globulin product that could treat COVID-19. Meanwhile, officials with the AABB, an international nonprofit focused on transfusion medicine and cellular therapies, have concentrated efforts primarily on collecting plasma for immediate use. But they acknowledged that convalescent plasma could end up serving as "bridge therapy" to buy time until the hyperimmune globulin products are available. "AABB recognizes the importance of ensuring that convalescent plasma is available as a transfusion therapy for patients today, as well as to develop future treatments," the agency said in a statement. Representatives from all sides agree that the most pressing need is to increase the pool of COVID-19 survivors willing to donate plasma. They downplay talk of jockeying for donors in the nonprofit and for-profit worlds. "We don't view it as competition," said Chris Healey, president of corporate affairs at Grifols, a Spanish pharmaceutical company that has received nearly $13 million in funding from the U.S. Department of Defense to develop its own hyperimmune globulin product. "We're all pointed in the same direction." One solution may be organizations such as Berrent's nonprofit Survivor Corps, which started in late March with a Facebook group that's grown to 42,000 members and now includes international partnerships and a pro bono advertising campaign, A Call to Arms. Berrent has given plasma four times now, including to a biotech firm that sent a phlebotomist to her home and gave her a $100 Amazon card for her trouble. Survivor Corps aims to function as a "one-stop shop" for donors interested in giving COVID-19 plasma, Berrent said. And, she said, it also could serve as a single source for recruitment, freeing scientists in government, academia and industry to focus on finding answers, not scouting for survivors. "Free markets work beautifully in many, many situations," Berrent said. "During a global pandemic, during a time of crisis, we need collaboration and efficiency."

             A health worker takes a drop of blood for the COVID-19 antibody test after at the Diagnostic and Wellness Center on May 5 in Torrance, California. Antibody tests are not completely reliable. Scientists hope another testing method — antigen testing — may help the U.S. test more people. There's a difference between diagnostic, antibody, and antigen tests. All provide different levels of reliability and speed. NPR health correspondent Rob Stein breaks down the differences and explains why public health officials are especially hopeful about antigen testing.

If you're thinking this might be a good time to adopt a dog, you're not the only one. City Dogs Rescue usually adopts out 20 to 30 dogs in one month, according to adoption counselor Jillian Molina. In March, it adopted out 40 dogs. Colleen Bernhard, the director of operations at Lucky Dog Animal Rescue, told me that in one week in March, "we brought in 149 animals from high-kill shelters and adopted out 134. That is our average for one month normally." Some rescues are seeing an unprecedented number of foster applications. Sue Bell, executive director of Homeward Trails, told us its foster applications have increased more than 50%.  It makes sense — in an era of shelter-in-place orders and social distancing, many of us long for a little companionship (and a reason to see the light of day). Before you rush into adopting a canine companion, here are a few things to consider.  The coronavirus pandemic won't last forever, and adopting a dog is a long-term commitment.  Kayla Fratt, a certified dog behavior consultant and owner of Journey Dog Training, recommends thinking through some basic questions. For example: Think about your life post-pandemic. Make sure you're adopting a dog that matches that lifestyle, not your current one or your aspirational one. Speaking from experience, Fratt notes that a lot of people like to think they're more active than they actually are. "They're actually not going out and really hitting the trails all day, every day in a way that some of these really, really high-energy dogs do need." Fratt warns, "I would really caution people who weren't thinking in January that they might get a dog in 2020 against springing on that now."  But if you were planning to adopt a dog before the coronavirus pandemic, now could be a great time to take that step. More time at home means more time to bond with a new dog. You'll also have increased availability to work on training. This can be especially helpful if your dog needs to be crate trained or if you've adopted a puppy or a rescue with more behavioral concerns. Fratt recommends implementing a training protocol called "SMART x 50," developed by Kathy Sdao. "SMART" stands for "See, Mark, And Reward Training." The method relies on positive reinforcement: "[Sdao suggests] counting out 50 pieces of kibble and rewarding your dog for 50 small good things throughout the day," says Fratt. "If you do this and nothing else to train your dog, you're going to end up with a relatively nice dog." If you adopt a fearful or anxious dog, this is a good time to work through some of those issues. You can take it for walks during off-peak hours and slowly build up to meeting strangers. Socialization, which is important for puppies and fearful dogs, will be more difficult to achieve in an era of social distancing.  If you feel like you're in over your head, it'll be harder to seek help from outside sources. You won't be able to take your dog to classes.  Don't delay dog training just because you can't go somewhere in person! A lot of dog trainers are currently offering online classes, and YouTube is a great resource if you need to teach your dog basic commands like sit, stay or come.  Another downside? You may have limited access to necessary supplies. Try to anticipate everything you'll need initially to care for your new dog. You'll want to minimize trips to the pet store and consider how many orders you place online. Deliveries could be delayed. Cleaning supplies are still hard to find in some places, so plan for that too. If you don't have a car and you're avoiding ride-hailing services right now, consider how you plan to transport your dog to the vet. It's not fun to think about, but the Humane Rescue Alliance urges people to have an emergency preparedness plan for what happens to their pet if they fall ill. You may want to prepare an emergency supply kit for your pet with two weeks' worth of food, medications and other necessary supplies. If you're working from home, currently furloughed or unemployed, you're able to spend 24/7 with your new dog. "Down the line, when you do restart work, that might be a really big shift for your dog," Fratt notes. Sticking to a schedule will help your dog transition to post-pandemic life. Fratt recommends feeding and walking your dog at the same time every day.  If you plan to be out of the house 40 hours a week when this is over, plan some time apart from your dog now so it doesn't come as a total shock later.  "One of the beautiful things with this pandemic is you can build up to this," says Fratt. Try leaving your dog alone incrementally — you can start out with as little as three minutes, graduating to five minutes, then 10, then 20 and beyond! The initial costs of adopting a dog are high. You'll have a lot of upfront expenses: food, a bed, a crate, a collar and leash, medicine, vet visits, shots, toys, etc.  After that, expect to budget around $100 per month for pet-related expenses, not including money for training or dog walkers. If you plan on hiring a dog walker post-pandemic, that could potentially cost you $100 per week.  During the 2008 financial crisis, pet surrenders went up because people could no longer afford to take care of their dogs.  If you've gotten to this point and you're convinced that adopting a dog right now is right for you, then ... Even though shelters are closed and rescues have paused in-person adoption events, many are hosting virtual meet-and-greets. Check with your local rescues to find out how they're handling adoptions in light of COVID-19. Focus on the quality, not quantity, of your adoption applications. Molina, of City Dogs Rescue, suggests you "scope out one or two rescues that you do want to adopt with and ... stick with the process."  Molina also recommends checking the rescue's social media accounts for the latest available dogs — they're likely to be more up to date than the website during periods of high demand. Consider looking at dogs that have been at the shelter for the longest. If you're willing to adopt a puppy or take on harder behaviors, include that on your application too. Molina says that this could make it easier for an adoption counselor to match you with a dog sooner. Be prepared for an online home visit. If you demonstrate you're thinking about the future, it will make you a more attractive candidate.  Molina advises, "You might say something like, 'I'm working from home right now. I don't need a dog walker. But when I go back to work, I intend to send my dog to day care or get a local dog walker to come visit when I'm at work.' ... People who are demonstrating long-term thinking, those [people] are going to stand out more than people who are kind of impulse-applying for a dog." Specificity — and patience — are key in the adoption process.  If you're not sure if you want to adopt or if you're not sure what kind of dog you can handle long term, fostering or dog-sitting are great options. Get some practice — you don't have to adopt right now just because you have more time at home.  This story was adapted for digital by Audrey Nguyen.

                Millions of jobs have evaporated, particularly from businesses that employ a large number of Hispanics — like hotels, restaurants, bars, building services.

             Millions of jobs have evaporated, particularly from businesses that employ a large number of Hispanics — like hotels, restaurants, bars, building services. It was just a few months ago when things were looking up for Latinos. Wages were rising and unemployment had hit a record low. As the U.S. economy marked its longest expansion on record, Latino families marked better times with milestone purchases. They bought more homes than any ethnic group, including whites. Another positive: a record number of Hispanics started attending college with enrollment nearly tripling in the last two decades. Now, that historic wave of Latino prosperity appears to be at risk from the coronavirus pandemic. The devastation in job losses is widespread in America, as the unemployment rate has climbed to 14.7%, the highest level since the Great Depression. But the latest U.S. jobs report shows that Latinos are the worst hit, with a record jobless rate of 18.9%, higher than any other ethnic group.  Loading...  Research shows that minority communities are especially vulnerable in economic downturns. During the Great Recession just over a decade ago, Latino fortunes were harmed far more than whites, and the damage endured. It took longer for them to regain lost jobs and wages. And it's especially hard for immigrants.  "Migrants are not only the first ones to lose their job but will be the last ones to regain it," Manuel Orozco, a director at the Inter-American Dialogue and also a senior fellow at Harvard University's Center for International Development of the Inter-American Dialogue. This time, the pain could be far worse. In the span of just two months, millions of jobs have evaporated, particularly from businesses that employ a large number of Hispanics — hotels, restaurants, bars, building services.  No one is traveling or going out to eat during the lockdowns and that has sliced 5.5 million jobs from restaurants and bars and another 839,000 from hotels in April alone.  And with offices shut down, it's led to another 259,000 job losses from building services — an industry with over 40% Hispanic employees. Workers like Anabel, from El Salvador, who has lived in Los Angeles for 12 years.  Until recently, Anabel worked two jobs — four days as a cleaner at a Beverly Hills designer store and one day a week at an office building — making $14 an hour. But the store closed a few weeks ago and she still has the the building job, but that's just four hours of work, and she makes barely enough to make ends meet.  Anabel says she didn't pay her May rent — it was the first time she was delinquent. "All of us here in the apartment building have gone to the manager and said we can't pay," Anabel told NPR. "How can we pay without jobs?" She says the apartment building manager has warned renters not to fall too far behind, otherwise they'll be evicted once the statewide moratorium on evictions is lifted. Anabel says she picks up food from the local church and a food pantry. She's sewing masks to try and make some money. Anabel asked NPR to use only her first name, since she is undocumented. Activists and economists who track the Latino community worry that Anabel's plight is widespread. Many domestic workers who are undocumented have also lost income in large numbers. This largely hidden workforce is more than 2.5 million strong, according to the National Domestic Workers Alliance. Many of them are out of work because of social distancing. They include workers like house cleaners, cooking, laundry and caring for dependents.  More than half of them identify as Hispanic or Latina, more than 90% are women, and most of them are primary breadwinners for their families, according to a survey titled the Invisible and Unregulated World of Domestic Work. Among the country's lowest paid jobs, these workers have very little savings, they don't qualify for federal or state relief programs, and have few places to go for help. The Hispanic population has more than doubled in the past two decades. They have made enormous strides during the economic recovery of the last decade, but they are still very vulnerable. Hispanics still earn about 25% less than white workers do. And even though their poverty rate fell to an all-time low recently, it was still more than double the rate of non-Hispanic whites.  The hope was that the recent wins would continue, and lift the community from out of America's underclass. The coronavirus has arrested that march forward with no end in sight, for now. NPR's Carrie Kahn contributed reporting for this story.We are social creatures. So it's no surprise that quarantine fatigue has begun to set in. "Humans are wired to come together physically," says psychologist  Judith Moskowitz of Northwestern University. But, loneliness has become widespread in modern life. And, social distancing has just exacerbated the problem, Moskowitz says. Social connection is essential to our well-being, since prolonged isolation can increase the risk of depression and anxiety, says Dr. Sandro Galea of Boston University's School of Public Health. "We know from other events, the longer the isolation, the more risk," Galea says. Social distancing recommendations will remain in place for months to come, and until there's a vaccine, limits on big gatherings will likely continue. For the elderly or those who live alone, the isolation can be particularly grueling. But, people are finding new ways to interact with each other, even under extraordinary circumstances.  Here are some strategies to connect with others. Note: If you're feeling persistent sadness or anxiety that interferes with day-to-day life, consider seeing a therapist (which you can do online, too). 1. Don't scroll, but do connect online, with real-time activities When it comes to our emotional health, social media platforms can be a double-edged sword. Simply scrolling through a Facebook, TikTok or Instagram feed may not help you connect with other people in a meaningful way. So instead of cultivating that empty FOMO (fear of missing out) feeling, use the power of virtual platforms to connect more intentionally, more deeply. Start by asking yourself: What matters to you? Do you have a hobby you'd like to resurrect, or take up for the first time? A whole world of online, live-streamed classes has opened up, from ceramics to languages to bread-making. Always wanted to play the banjo? "Find a banjo class," says Judith Moskowitz, a psychologists at Northwestern University. The face-to-face, real time connections allow us to pick up on facial expressions and body language to better simulate real-world gatherings. A live, synchronous class, Moskowitz says, "is one way to get to know people and to broaden your social network." Outside of classes, if you use social media to stay in touch with friends, instead of just commenting on posts, make the effort to interact one-on-one, says Joe Walther, who directs the Center for Information Technology & Society at the University of California Santa Barbara. "It's the intimacy of the messages, and the depth of the interactive conversation that will sustain us," he says. 2. Making art is a social act: Express yourself and share. Looking for a place to connect with others who use art to express themselves? The UnLonely Project has created a community through its Stuck At Home Together initiative. You can watch a short film, then participate in an online conversation. You can view others' art or share your own. And for motivation to get started, the group has designed creative challenges, like crafting a self-portrait from objects around the house. The group behind these initiatives includes physicians and researchers who document how the creative processes can help people maintain good health and fend off disease. "When you make art, you are in the moment — you are with [your] thoughts and feelings," says Jeremy Nobel, who founded the program and is also on the faculty at Harvard Medical School. And by sharing what you create, it's as if you're sharing a "representation of your thoughts and feelings, whether it's a painting, a poem, a baked good, or a garden," Nobel says. He says loneliness isn't just about lacking companionship. "Often loneliness starts with a sense of estrangement or disconnection from who you are. How do you fit into the world?" Nobel says. Art can be very powerful for centering and positioning — a way to explore your own identity. "And I actually believe for many people, that's an essential first step to connecting with other people in an authentic way," Nobel says. 3. Reach out to the elderly  For many elderly people, social distancing has brought layers of challenges. "It's not just the lack of contact with others," says physician Kelli Tice Wells who is a senior medical director at health insurer Florida Blue. It's also "not being able to navigate things that can be critical to your life" such as on-line grocery shopping or getting prescriptions, Wells says. Florida Blue now offers virtual companionship and assistance to seniors through a program called Papa Pals, which matches elderly adults with younger people, who are paid to provide assistance. Miriam Membreno, of Miami, Fla., who is trained as a social worker, recently started working as a Papa Pal, after her hours at her regular job were cut short. She meets with a few elderly people virtually. "I do feel like I'm helping them be less lonely," Membreno says. She says sometimes they just want to share stories, and she likes to listen. Other times, during a virtual visit, she says, they share worries that they have bottled up. "Just having those stress and concerns released," is worthwhile, she says. Another program for seniors, Live a Dream, collects video montages to brighten a senior's day. Young people can submit a short video to share. You can tell a joke, play an instrument, or just give some encouraging words. There are numerous efforts to connect elderly people in senior living facilities with younger people around the country. Check with local groups to find one where you live. 4. Become a citizen-scholar, a online tutor, or assistant to the visually impaired: Find your way to volunteer, virtually As many community organizations struggle to keep up with rising needs and shrinking budgets, volunteer options — even contactless ones — abound. Does the idea of becoming a citizen scholar sound intriguing? The Smithsonian has digital volunteer opportunities. For instance, "citizen scholars are invited to transcribe historic documents including diaries and working papers of prominent Americans," according to the Smithsonian website. To get involved, you can check out the Smithsonian Transcription Center. Or, you could help people with low-vision, a program called Be My Eyes, is an app that connects people who are blind or have low-vision with volunteers who offer virtual assistance. VolunteerMatch, a database of volunteer opportunities has a searchable site for virtual volunteering, with thousands of postings around the country, calling for all kinds of skills from tutoring kids to making face masks. Find more options on Idealist.org. 5. Keep friendships alive, with small acts of kindness  Sometimes, a small gesture can help you reconnect. Even though we can't bake together, think about dropping off some cookies to a friend. Ask your neighbor if you can pick up some grocery items for them on your next trip. Organize a puzzle or game swap. During these strange and difficult times, "you can feel like you're really depleted and you have nothing to give," says Judith Moskowitz. "But just a simple act of helping someone else out comes back and bolsters you as well," she says. An act of kindness can lift our spirits. "And that really feels good." Look for creative ways to nourish your friendships, like working through a cookbook together, or watching movies together, suggests Lydia Denworth, author of Friendship: The Evolution, Biology, and Extraordinary Power of Life's Fundamental Bond. And don't miss the opportunity for small touch points throughout the day: Even sharing a joke over text can make you feel less alone, she says. "Friendship is critical in times of stress — that's what friendship is for," Denworth says. Elena Renken contributed to this report.

             Full Belly Farm, a 450-acre, organic farm, in California's Capay Valley northwest of Sacramento, is busier than ever trying to ramp up production to meet soaring demand. Images of some American farmers dumping milk, plowing under crops and tossing perishables amid sagging demand and falling prices during the deadly coronavirus pandemic has made for dramatic TV. But it's not the whole story. "We had a reporter call here and say, 'We want to see some produce rotting in the field and milk going down the drains,' " said Judith Redmond, a longtime farmer in California's Capay Valley, northwest of Sacramento. "And I said, 'Well, actually, that's not what's happening in the Capay Valley.' "  Redmond, a founding partner of the 450-acre, organic Full Belly Farm, is busier than ever trying to ramp up production to meet soaring demand. From California to Maine, the movement known as community supported agriculture (CSA) is booming. Members buy a share of a farm's often organic harvest that gets delivered weekly in a box. CSA programs almost everywhere report a surge in memberships and growing waiting lists.  "The interest in getting local, fresh, organic produce just has skyrocketed during this crisis," Redmond said.

             400-acre, organic Full Belly Farm, in California's Capay Valley north of Sacramento, is busier than ever trying to ramp up production to meet soaring demand. CSA programs almost everywhere report a surge in memberships and growing waiting lists. As with many farms, the restaurant and farmers market sides of her business have cratered. But the CSA side, which includes business across the San Francisco Bay Area, has jumped to 2,000 boxes a week. "We've doubled our CSA box numbers and quadrupled our add-ons like wheat flour, oils like olive oil, nuts, fruit juices, even yarn," Redmond said. CSAs have long been something of a niche market that have never really penetrated the mainstream. Yet, the coronavirus just might prove to be sparking community supported agriculture's breakout moment. "In all the time that we've worked with CSAs, which is several decades, we've never seen a surge as quickly as we have of the last few weeks," said Evan Wiig with the Community Alliance with Family Farmers, which supports and lobbies on behalf of CSAs across California.

             An example of summer produce from the organic CSA Red Fire Farm in the Connecticut River Valley outside of Amherst, Mass. "It's sort of a heyday for CSAs," he said. "Farmers that were starting in March struggling to get enough members for the season – which we see every year — by mid-March were dealing with waiting lists with hundreds of people trying to get in." The coronavirus has exposed the vulnerabilities and fragility of the U.S. global agribusiness supply chain. The CSA model's focus on local and fresh is ideally suited for a crisis that has people deeply worried about germs on lettuce, beets or broccoli as the crops make their way from the field to the kitchen counter. People "don't want that many hands on their food right now," said Sarah Voiland. "And we can offer that."  She and her husband, Ryan, run the organic CSA Red Fire Farm, in the Connecticut River Valley outside of Amherst, Mass.  The low-touch factor is an especially big draw at a time when a trip to a supermarket can involve masks, social-distancing lines, hand sanitizer and angst. "The supply chain with CSA is very short. It's like, we harvest the produce and you come pick it up" at a local site, she said.

             Sarah Voiland, who helps run Red Fire Farm, delivers fresh produce for the Brighton CSA in the Boston area in 2019. "We think people's habits will shift because of this" pandemic, said John Tecklin, who runs the CSA Mountain Bounty Farm, serving the northern California communities around Truckee, Nevada City and Lake Tahoe, as well as Reno, Nev.  "For a lot of them, it's kind of a wake-up call: 'what's really important to you?' "  In a move spurred partly by the pandemic, and a sign of the changing times for CSAs, Tecklin's farm is now entering into a partnership called Forever Farms with a non-profit land trust, a local food advocacy group and a food cooperative to help secure ownership of part of the farm's land in perpetuity.   "It's local food security for our community," Tecklin said. "In these times it's more important than ever now."  He believes that's the same motivation driving the recent doubling of interest in his CSA. "Everyone is just all of a sudden, 'Wow this is the kind of thing we need, we need local farmers who we're dealing with directly.' "  Some farms, large and small, that relied on restaurant, hotel, school and university food-service contracts have been hit hard. Many are now scrambling to adapt to a CSA-type model, at least in the short term, to survive. Some are now partnering with CSAs in a mutually beneficial pact that helps CSAs meet growing demand while offering an outlet for suffering farms. Federal and state governments are also now taking a page from CSAs. As part of its coronavirus relief, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has put out a call for $3 billion in contracts for farmers to produce and deliver fresh produce and dairy boxes to food banks, many of which are struggling to support the growing ranks of Americans who are hurting and out of work. Some states are trying to redirect to charities farm produce that in normal times would have headed to restaurants and hotels. California has expanded funding to help cover the costs of harvesting, packaging and transporting fresh fruits and vegetables from farms to local food banks. The state's Farm to Family Program, a partnership with the California Association of Food Banks (CAFB) and the USDA, provides fresh produce to needy households across the state.    CSAs still represent a very small slice of America's $100 billion farm economy. But their renaissance marks a rare bit of good economic news for an agriculture industry battered by trade wars, threatened by climate change and now facing a global pandemic. And the new success brings new challenges. Many CSAs are now scrambling to find additional labor to plant, harvest and deliver produce to meet the moment. "We're totally able to produce so much more than we are, but we don't have the workers," said Redmond, of Full Belly Farm. "We're so stressed out by that that, you know, just knowing that there's going to be a difficult time getting workers, it just doesn't make any sense to ramp up production." A big question for CSAs is whether the renewed interest represents a fleeting reaction to fear or a more sustainable, long-term trend. "When the lockdown or shelter-in-place started in March, people were just a little panicked," Redmond said. "And what we're trying to do is turn it into a longer-term relationship with our farm and those members so that they see that there's a tremendous advantage of getting food locally from people that they know."You might have never heard the phrase "contact tracing" until recently. Now it's a part of the daily conversation about the coronavirus pandemic. Dr. Robert Redfield, the head of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, has said that contact tracing is key to halting the spread of the disease. It's not a new idea. In fact, contact tracing is used all over the world. It's based on the knowledge that someone with a contagious disease will infect a certain number of people. With the coronavirus, it's likely two or three. So the goal is to track down anyone in recent contact with a newly diagnosed patient, then monitor the health of these contacts while they stay at home for the period of time when they might become infected — roughly two weeks — or are held in an isolation facility. You can read our article about contact tracing or get the essential details from our video above. As the U.S. hires potentially hundreds of thousands of contact tracers to contain the coronavirus, health departments could look to models from such regions as Africa, South Asia and Latin America on how these teams will do their work. Partners in Health, which is known for its work in Haiti, Rwanda and Peru, is helping to set up a coronavirus contact tracing program in Massachusetts.  In West Africa, contact tracing was crucial in bringing the 2014-2015 Ebola outbreak to a close. Raj Panjabi's organization Last Mile Health helped set up contact tracing teams in Liberia during that crisis. "We couldn't break the chain of transmission and drive the epidemic down to zero cases in Liberia without contact tracing," says Panjabi, a physician at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital. In the remote part of Liberia where Panjabi's group was working, contact tracers were hired to investigate each Ebola case and track down all the "contacts" of those diagnosed cases. "The contact tracers got hired and chosen from within the community," says Panjabi — and that kind of community knowledge offers a tremendous advantage. "They'd locate the listed contact because they know the community. They have trust with the community," he says. "And they'd identify any additional contacts who were missed in the initial investigation." Panjabi says having social connections and being good with people is more important in this job than a medical degree. Most of the people doing this work for Last Mile Health were not medical professionals, but the teams reported to nurses and public health officials. As the U.S. looks to contain the coronavirus so that the economy can start to reopen, Raj Panjabi says contact tracing could be a win-win. "Where are the hundreds of thousands of American [contact tracers] going to come from?" Panjabi asks. "One possible way is to actually hire Americans who've been unemployed by this pandemic and put them to work." Renee Klahr, Ben de la Cruz, Marc Silver

             A couple dressed in protective gear walks through Chicago's O'Hare International Airport last week as the normal frantic bustle in the terminal was replaced by an unsettling calm. In recent years, airlines have been cramming more seats onto planes and squishing passengers ever closer to one another. The entire airport experience isn't much better, with overcrowded eateries and bookshops, as well as tightly packed lines of people queuing up at check-in counters, at security checkpoints and on the jet bridge for boarding. But that's not the case anymore. "Airports are empty. The flights are empty," said physician Frank Garcini after stepping off a recent flight from Phoenix at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport. "I was traveling on a small airplane with probably 40-something seats, and there were only six passengers on the flight," he said. "I think life as we know it has changed" because of the coronavirus, Garcini said, adding that airlines will need to adapt. "I anticipate that the standard operating procedures in the future will change because of our new reality." Social distancing in the airport Few industries have been hit as hard by the coronavirus pandemic as the airlines. With the number of people flying having plummeted more than 90% since the beginning of March, U.S. airlines have slashed their flight schedules and parked half their fleets, more than 3,000 planes in all. The few planes that are flying are almost empty, averaging just 17 passengers per domestic flight, according to the industry group Airlines for America. And now, to try to ensure the safety of the passengers they do have, airlines are making changes. Most U.S. carriers are requiring passengers and crew members to wear masks or facial coverings in gate areas and on flights. In the terminals, airports are taking other steps to protect passengers and employees, such as putting tape or markings on floors to help people remain at least 6 feet apart when waiting in line. "We put up sneeze guards throughout the terminal between customers and employees [and] at the gate when you scan your boarding pass," said Mike Hanna, vice president of operations for United Airlines at O'Hare airport. "We're encouraging customers to scan their own boarding pass as well, so we're not handling their documents. We're also limiting the number of people going down a jet bridge at one time so they can also separate and socially distance themselves," Hanna explained. "Like I'm in a Twilight Zone episode" On a recent day at O'Hare, passengers arrive free of traffic jams, with none of the usual chaos at the curb. Inside the terminal, there are no mobs of people dragging roller bags while they try to figure out which interminable line to get into. It's just a sea of empty check-in kiosks and counters, with a dozen or so airline and airport employees milling about, with no passengers to assist. With so few people in the airport, social distancing is easy. Normally packed gate areas have scores of empty seats. There are no lines to worry about, and if there were, tape on the floors mark how to space 6 feet apart. It's eerily quiet in the terminal, the normal frantic bustle replaced by an unsettling calm. "I feel like I'm in a Twilight Zone episode, kinda. It's like, super-eerie" says 21-year-old Quinn Scannell, who was living in Madagascar but had to leave as the borders there closed. 
                The nearly deserted check-in area at Terminal 1 of Chicago's O'Hare airport reflects the sharp decline in air travel, as the number of people flying has plummeted more than 90% since the beginning of March.

             The nearly deserted check-in area at Terminal 1 of Chicago's O'Hare airport reflects the sharp decline in air travel, as the number of people flying has plummeted more than 90% since the beginning of March. Other travelers include students who were studying abroad, people going to visit ill or anxious family members and those whose work is essential. Among them is Kension Edwards, 47, a medical-equipment service technician from Raleigh, N.C. "What we're workin' on, it's important for lots of people, so my way of doing my part, I guess," Edwards says. With no long lines and with airplane middle seats blocked out, there are fewer headaches for him in traveling now. "It's nice having the extra room, but it's still a little bit scary because I think [the coronavirus is] a little bit worse than people thought at first," he says. "As much separation as possible" United is more thoroughly cleaning and disinfecting airplane interiors by using electrostatic cleaning, a process in which electrostatically charged cleaning fluids are sprayed throughout the cabins. The disinfectant "then begins to wrap around armrests, chairs, tables, etc. throughout the aircraft, and that helps to expand our coverage when we actually spray disinfectant," Hanna said. "Some people call it a fogger, but it's not really a fogger," he added. "But it really covers very, very well." Like most airlines, United is also taking steps to create physical distancing on planes. "We definitely are blocking out middle seats, and where we have two seats on an aisle, we're doing them alternating window, aisle, window, aisle, to drive as much separation as possible," Hanna said. Even with middle seats blocked off, a recent Delta flight from Los Angeles to Detroit was the most crowded plane that frequent travelers like Johannes Pulst-Korenberg had seen in weeks. "Planes were ghost towns as of the past couple weeks that I've been traveling, and now it's like a third of seats [are full]? A fourth?" he said. With airlines cutting so many flights from their schedules, some of the few flights that remain have been getting fuller in recent weeks.  Pulst-Korenberg is a neurologist splitting his time between LA and Philadelphia, something he says sounded like an OK plan before COVID-19. "And now with COVID, it's a little more awkward, although I still feel fundamentally safe because I wear a good mask and I know how to use it," he says. "I am a little concerned though. I definitely don't trust the average person to not fly when they're sick, and if you have the sniffles, it's not going to prevent you from getting on a plane. On this flight, nobody dares to sniffle, and everyone wears a face covering. When a flight attendant passes out a snack pack, a strange thing happens: Passengers eagerly dig past the Cheez-Its to get to the coveted Purell wipe inside. Jabar Akbar has a surgical mask he picked up on the job. "I'm a nurse from Los Angeles, headed to Connecticut to help with the coronavirus epidemic," Akbar says. He has been traveling constantly since March, volunteering to work at hospitals hard hit by COVID-19. "I want to be on the front line. I think that's where my skills are best served," he says. Plexiglass, touchless technology and "immunity passports" Social distancing on planes right now is relatively easy because air travel demand is next to nothing. But what about when large numbers of people start flying again? "In the long term, that's a business model that cannot be sustained," said Nick Calio, president of Airlines for America, in a Senate commerce committee hearing on Wednesday on the impact of the coronavirus on the aviation industry. Aviation industry analyst Marisa Garcia explains that blocking out or removing middle seats would reduce the number of seats airlines could sell by about one-third, sharply reducing revenue or forcing the airlines to raise prices on other seats to make up the difference.

             At O'Hare airport, normally packed gate areas have scores of empty seats. "It would force a reduction of capacity on all aircraft to the point where air fares would probably skyrocket, increasing as much as, over 50%," Garcia said. Airlines and airplane manufacturers are looking at other ways to protect passengers from the spread of the coronavirus and other communicable diseases. Some suggest plexiglass dividers between seats or turning the middle seat around to face the rear of the plane. The Italian aircraft-interior design company Aviointeriors has drawn up plans to combine those ideas with a kind of plastic capsule that would surround each seat. "So, you might still have three passengers seated together," Garcia says. "But there would be a plastic bubble between you, if you will, that still allows you to feel comfortable, but it would protect you in addition to a mask you might wear or if you were to remove the mask to eat or drink." Any such solution would cost the airlines plenty, and right now U.S. airlines are burning through cash at a rate of $10 billion a month. But there are less expensive changes, such as using touchless technology so passengers and employees don't have contact during interactions and transactions, temperature scanning of travelers as they go through security or board the plane, and requiring "immunity passports" that would indicate if a passenger had recently been tested for the virus and cleared. But regardless of which changes are adopted, it's safe to say a new normal will be coming to air travel and it will be unlike anything we've experienced before.Kids have lots of questions about staying home right now. When can I go out to see my friends again? When will this be over?  To answer them (and have a little fun), NPR's Life Kit reached out to Sesame Street's beloved monster, Grover, to speak directly to kids. Grover talks with Life Kit hosts Anya Kamenetz and Cory Turner about wearing a mask, missing his friends and why it's OK to be sad sometimes.  (Just for parents: Sesame Workshop's Rosemarie Truglio shares tips for parenting in a pandemic, here.)  This interview has been edited for length and clarity.  Grover: Hello, everybody! Hey, all you children and mommies and daddies. I hope you are all safe and well right now! Cory: Grover, this is kind of a weird time right now, isn't it? Not only are we apart from some of the people we love, there are also lots more rules, aren't there? And we can't all go outside and play whenever we want. Anya: So we wanted to know, Grover, what's keeping you busy right now? Grover: Well, I am trying to help around the house. I try to make my bed, and I take my dishes to the sink and try to pick up my toys.  But I also do things around the neighborhood. I am a delivery monster, and I go to the grocery store, and I pick up groceries for people who cannot go to the grocery store. I put on my mask and I am very safe. And I pick up groceries and take them to people like Mrs. Crustworthy.  Anya: Grover, I'm sorry to ask this, but how do you fit your mask over your nose? Grover: Well, it goes ... it goes ... well, kind of around it. And it just has to cover my nostrils. You know, I made my own mask. And it is very stylish too. It fits me perfectly. it has little cute bunny rabbits. I designed it myself. Anya: One thing that I'm hearing from some kids is that they are really missing seeing their friends. And I'm wondering, what do you do when you miss your friends? Grover: Well, I try to stay connected with my friends over video chat. Actually, just before talking to you, I was on with Snuffy. Well ... his left eye anyway. It's kind of hard to see all of him on a little tiny screen.  Anya: Grover, what are some other ways we can make these video chats more fun? Grover: Sometimes it is fun to have a meal together with somebody, and you can make the same meal. And it is sort of like having dinner together.  You know, I feel like I'm busier now than I was before. And I am seeing some of my relatives more often, albeit on Zoom or some other video chat. You can play with your friends. If you both have the same game, you can play the game together. You can play a board game. You can play card games with one another, and it is a lot of fun. Cory: Grover, do you have any other ideas that maybe don't require a screen? Grover: You can play with your toys and use your own imagination. You can go anywhere in your own imagination. Reading a book also is a fun thing to do by yourself. And your mind can go anywhere in a book as well. Cory: Especially if there's a monster at the end of it.  Grover: Oh, I do not think I want to read that book. Anya: Grover, have you been doing a lot of daydreaming? Because that's something I kind of remember you doing when I was a kid? Grover: Well, I do like to daydream. I think it is very healthy for everybody to just take a moment and let their mind wander and see where it goes. Cory: I'd love to know, where does your mind go when you daydream? Grover: I like to imagine that I am high on a mountain. I can see the whole world and all of my friends down below. And I wave to them all. Anya: So Grover, there's one really big question, and I don't know if you know the answer to it, but I'm kind of hoping that you do. And I know that it's the top question for almost every kid. And that is, when is this going to be over? Grover: You are asking me? I do not know. I am sorry. But that is OK. You know, it is OK not to know things. That is all right. But I know that this will be over someday. And we will all get to see each other again and play with each other again. This is just for now. That is what my mommy says. Anya: Oh, I like that.  So Grover, Cory and I were hoping to get your help playing a game right now. And it's something that helps us stay in the moment so we can think a little bit less about what's going to happen later on. And it's called Five, Four, Three, Two, One. Grover: OK, is it a counting game?  Cory: It's kind of a just-living-in-the-moment-game. I want you to name five things you can see, four things you can touch, three things you can hear, two that you can smell, and then finally, one thing that you can taste.  Grover: Oh, all right. Well, I see a tree outside my window. I see a hat of mine on a coat rack. I guess it really should be on a hat rack. I will have to deal with that later. I see my mommy working on her computer, and I see you on my little screen.  Oh, and of course, the penguins. They are my next meeting. We have a virtual lunch date. I guess they started early.  Cory: Now four things that you can touch. Grover: Well, I can touch my soft blue fur. My special pen and my note pad for writing shopping lists. Oh, I can touch the chair that I'm sitting in.  Cory: Now three things that you can hear. Grover: Well, I can hear you, Cory and Anya. And then I can hear my mommy over across the room, clickety-clacketing on her computer.  Cory: Now, two things you can smell? Grover: Oh. Well, I think I can smell some tuna. Mommy?! Did you make some tuna sandwiches? Oh, for lunch? Oh, good! Oh, good! I cannot wait to have that later. And let's see. You know what? I cannot smell anything else. Tuna just kind of takes over. Cory: And then the last thing. One thing you can taste? Grover: I can almost taste that tuna! Can I have it early? Cory: Well, at least now you're not thinking about the far, far future. You're just thinking about lunch. Grover: You know what? You are right. That is a very neat thing you just observed — that if we have little things we look forward to, then we might forget about some of the other things that we are kind of worried about. Cory: I'm wondering, Grover, you spend a lot of time talking to younger kids, but I know that there are also a lot of older kids right now who are missing their high school graduations, who are missing college graduations, who are feeling really sad. And I'm wondering if you have anything to say to them or even to the grown ups who are listening right now and feeling a little bit sad or a little bit worried. Grover: It is OK to be sad every now and then — that is only human. Or monster. Everybody who is alive gets sad from time to time, and that is OK. But this is going to pass, and we will all be able to get together and celebrate when we do. Anya: I guess it's time for us to say goodbye. Grover: Before I go, I want to thank all of the people out there who are helping others. You know, like nurses and emergency workers and the people at the stores who go to work every day and they help people. And that is so important.  We should all thank them. Whether it is putting a sign out our windows for the mail carriers. Or just standing outside your door or opening your window at night, like I do, with all my neighbors and yelling at the top of my lungs, 'Thank you!' Anya: I love doing that. That's our favorite part of the day over here. Cory: In fact, let's send one big, radio 'Thank you!' right now.  On three. One, two, three ... Everyone: THANK YOU!!!

             A bucket used to collect samples after people have been tested for COVID-19 is seen at a drive through testing site in Arlington, Va., on March 20. One group in northern Virginia is paying special attention to the coronavirus's impact on Latinos. As Latino households across the country are pummeled by the virus outbreak, staff from Neighborhood Health, a chain of medical clinics in northern Virginia, have stepped up testing efforts in areas where that community is hardest-hit. Of the health center's 30,000 patients, 50% are Latino immigrants hailing from Central America. They are predominantly low-income and uninsured. And though they make up half of the patient population, Latinos represent nearly 90% of those who have tested positive for COVID-19 at the group's clinics. On one day earlier this month, the medical team's endeavors took them to a small parking lot near Four Mile Run park in the city of Alexandria. A large blue tent set up at the entrance of the lot marks one of five makeshift coronavirus testing sites.  "The next walk-up patient can come up," says Jessica Alvarenga, a medical assistant administering tests at the booth, over a walkie-talkie. Meanwhile, mask-clad people on foot form two lines while carloads of patients pull in for their respective drive-through appointments.  "The testing rates in some minority communities across the country is much lower," says Dr. Basim Khan, primary care physician and executive director of Neighborhood Health. "So, not only are they getting more disproportionately impacted, but you're also seeing that the response is not as robust as it needs to be." Latinos make up about 18% of the U.S. population. But when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently analyzed provisional COVID-19 deaths and racial and ethnic data in areas where more than 100 people had died, it found Latinos made up about 27% of coronavirus deaths. Khan hopes to change that narrative for his patients whose homes line the border of Arlington County and Alexandria, an area called Arlandria. An influx of Salvadoran immigrants in the 1980s earned it the nickname "Chirilagua," after the city on the Pacific coast of El Salvador. Neighborhood Health has tested more than 800 patients for COVID-19 so far. Khan says members of the Latino community struggle to isolate themselves even after they've tested positive. They often work low-paying jobs deemed "essential" — sometimes with no protective gear.  And language barriers and questions over immigration status can make it harder for Latinos to access the health care systems or unemployment benefits that could provide relief.  "Because they have this illness, they're obviously not able to work and they're struggling to keep food on the table," Khan says. "It's been a really stressful and challenging situation for a lot of our patients who have tested positive."  Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam announced that the state will begin "phase one" of reopening on May 15.  But, for some, it's not so easy to move forward. Silsa Ortiz de Catalan, 47, is among the Neighborhood Health patients who live in crowded conditions at home. Catalan contracted coronavirus in late March and spread the disease to her entire family of four. Catalan, her husband and two adult sons share a one-bedroom apartment.  "I was working without gloves and without a mask," she says in Spanish, her words interpreted by a Neighborhood Health worker.  "I started to feel like I had a fever and I started shaking, but I didn't pay too much attention, so I kept working," Catalan says. Her bones and throat were aching, but she worked through the pain for several days at a well-known craft store.  The Guatemala native says her latest COVID-19 test came back negative, indicating she's recovered, but she has another problem: After being out of work for five weeks, how is she going to pay the past-due rent for May?  According to a recent Washington Post-Ipsos survey, 20% of Latinos say they've been laid off or furloughed since the outbreak began — compared to 11% of whites and 12% of workers of other races. African Americans and Latinos are also dying of COVID-19 at the highest rates.   When a patient's positive test result comes in from the lab, medical staff at Neighborhood Health reach out to the patient to discuss symptoms and determine the level of monitoring needed. For those with more acute symptoms, the doctor will recommend the delivery of a pulse oximeter to the patient to check oxygen levels on their own.  Meanwhile, another group of workers at the clinic conducts contact tracing with patients that test positive. They also provide the families with food.  As businesses across the country reopen, Khan is urging government officials to focus on the communities most impacted with more aggressive testing.  "First of all, it's just the right thing to do. But second is it reduces the likelihood of broader spread," he says. "We're as good as our weakest link."
                Before the coronavirus crisis, there were briefly more women on U.S. payrolls than men. That's no longer true. Women accounted for 55% of the rise in job losses last month.

             Before the coronavirus crisis, there were briefly more women on U.S. payrolls than men. That's no longer true. Women accounted for 55% of the rise in job losses last month. Very briefly, at the end of 2019 and the start of 2020, there were slightly more women on American nonfarm payrolls than men. That's no longer true. The historically disastrous April jobs report shows that the brunt of job losses fell on women. Women now account for around just under half — 49% — of American workers, and they accounted for 55% of the increase in job losses last month. One way of looking at why that matters that is to look at the gap that opened up between women's and men's unemployment last month. The below chart shows women's unemployment rate minus men's unemployment rate since 2007.  Usually, the line bumps around near or just below zero — meaning men's unemployment is usually near or slightly higher than women's. But that spike on the far right shows how women's unemployment leapt to be 2.7 points higher than men's in April. Women had an unemployment rate of 16.2% to men's 13.5% last month. That's uncommon for a recession. The below chart is a longer view, and the periods with gray backgrounds are recessions. During every recession since 1981, men's unemployment has shot up past women's — that is, the line dips negative.  This is a big sign of how the downturn caused by coronavirus is unlike past recessions, says Matthias Doepke, professor of economics at Northwestern University. He and some colleagues wrote a paper in March about the coronavirus' effects on women, before the first coronavirus job report was even out. "It's stuff we said was probably coming," Doepke said. They saw it coming for a couple of reasons, he says. One is the industries suffering most in this downturn. Past recessions have hit male-dominated industries like manufacturing and construction relatively hard — think about the housing downturn and automaker layoffs after the 2008 financial crisis, for example. Those helped push unemployment for men higher. This time is different, Doepke says: "The highest employment losses are things like restaurants and hospitality, hotels, and those are sectors with high female employment." But there may be an even more important factor here, he says: child care. "You have all these schools closed. So you have a much higher requirement for child care at home," he said. "And because women are going to do the majority of that already, they are more affected." It is true that women do more child care in the home right now. Even in families with both parents working full-time, women are far more likely than men to manage schedules and activities, and to take care of kids when sick. In addition, women are far more likely than men to be a single parent, meaning that a lack of child care leaves them with no options. "You have 60 million single moms in the United States and many of them have no alternative child care, especially now that grandparents are not supposed to come over anymore," Doepke said. "And so for many of them, it's simply not possible to work again. So there will be forced unemployment because of child care." The effects of this may last well beyond the coronavirus crisis — Doepke and his coauthors note that job losses in a recession often mean persistently lower wages, as well as less secure future employment. That may mean that one long-term effect of this crisis is a wider gender wage gap. However, Doepke also says some aspects of the current crisis could counteract those child-rearing forces working women are up against. "One side is the side of employers who are now going to be more flexible, offer work from home much more than they used to, and maybe also just become more aware that everybody has child care needs, not just mothers," he said. Many workers who are able to work from home, after all, have seen their fellow workers caring for children on Zoom meetings. The reality of parenting while working is much more visible for some workers and bosses now. In addition, the economic crisis could contribute to further shifting of social norms in terms of how much work fathers do. "There's also going to be millions of families right now where things actually completely reversed because the mother is maybe a doctor or at the hospital and has to be there," Doepke said. "Whereas the father is an academic like me or an office worker who can work from home or maybe even is unemployed and therefore by default becomes the primary provider of child care." But then, there remain the millions of workers who can't work from home and who are hard at work at the grocery store or delivering food. The gendered effects of the crisis will also vary by class and race, and will become much more clear as we get more and more jobs reports.
