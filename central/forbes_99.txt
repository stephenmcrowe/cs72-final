A blurry photo showing a CNN headline (“Two Deadly Viruses Are Killing Americans: Covid-19 And Racism”) and posted to Twitter became the platform’s most-liked tweet this week according to data from social media tracking firm NewsWhip, as turbulent protests triggered by George Floyd’s death brought thousands of Americans to the street, while the coronavirus pandemic is ongoing and unemployment reaches record levels. Smoke rises around a Minneapolis protester during a Saturday demonstration to call for justice for ... [+] George Floyd. “What a headline,” wrote Twitter user @1kingmyles about the CNN chyron, which was displayed during CNN Tonight’s May 27 broadcast. As of Sunday afternoon, the tweet had generated nearly 3 million likes and had been shared over 870,000 times.  In the video clip, Lemon discusses the deaths of Floyd and Ahmaud Arbery, along with the viral video of Amy Cooper calling the cops on a black man in Central Park, saying that longstanding racism, along with Covid-19, are infecting America.  Over 1.7 million Americans have been infected with Covid-19, while over 103,000 have died—but Centers for Disease Control data suggests black people are more likely to be hospitalized with coronavirus, while Wired reports that economic inequality, lack of access to quality healthcare, food deserts and other structural inequities contribute to black people being disproportionately impacted by the pandemic. According to data from the Washington Post on shootings in the U.S. by race, black people account for less than 13% of the overall population, but are shot and killed at a rate far higher than white people.  NewsWhip’s Twitter engagement data comes from its database of influential users, which tracks around 350,000 accounts.   Black people are killed in police shootings at a higher rate per million. "There are two major crises in this country tonight. Two deadly viruses killing Americans. COVID-19, Racism-20. Now we all know that racism is not new this year, but the latest racially-charged incident is from just last night,” said Lemon, referencing the video of a police officer kneeling on Floyd’s neck. "Racism is infecting this country, continues to infect this country. Just as surely as COVID-19. And we don't only see it in encounters between African Americans and the police. It even infects a simple walk in the park." 16.7%. That’s the black unemployment rate during the pandemic, according to data from the Department of Labor. The Hispanic rate stands at 18.9%, and according to Guardian, unemployment among blacks and Hispanics is typically double the white unemployment rate. Economists cited by the Washington Post said that the two groups tend to be concentrated in industries impacted by the pandemic, with jobs that can’t be done from home.  George Floyd’s death stoked nationwide outrage during a time in which people have largely been sheltering in place and unable to live their normal lives due to the pandemic. Historic unemployment and a desire among a significant number of Americans to end police killings of black people have seemingly created a powder keg. Protests are entering their sixth day, and in preceding nights have been volatile and marked by buildings set on fire, looting and violent altercations between protesters and police. President Trump has largely remained silent, and done little to call for calm or unity. He has, however, described protesters as “THUGS” and recommended additional law enforcement presence.

Saint Paul Mayor Melvin Carter gave an update on the names of the police officer-involved in the ... [+] shooting of William "Billy" Hughes Tuesday August 7, 2018 in St. Paul, MN. Carter said he was given inaccurate information during a police briefing, which he repeated at a Saturday morning press conference, according to CBS reporter David Begnaud. The reversal came after a local news outlet KARE 11 examined data from the Hennepin County Jail’s roster and found nearly all the people arrested actually live in Minneapolis or the surrounding metro area. Carter and other local officials earlier that day sought to paint the chaos in the city as driven by outsiders: “I want to be very, very clear: The people that are doing this are not Minneapolis residents,” Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey added. “They are coming in largely from outside of the city, from outside of the region, to prey on everything we have built over the last several decades.” At the earlier press conference, Department of Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington confirmed evidence of white supremacist groups trying to incite violence; Many posted messages online that encouraged people to go loot in Minneapolis and cause mayhem. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, who also announced that he would fully mobilize the Minnesota national guard for the first time in 164 years, called the unrest “an organized attempt to destabilize civil society with no regard for civil life or property.” The dynamic has changed over the last couple days, Walz, Carter and Frey said. Protests gradually shifted from being peaceful on Tuesday, but as more people came from outside of the city, they’ve turned increasingly violent in recent days. “Our great cities of Minneapolis and Saint Paul are under assault by people who do not share our values, who do not value life and the work that went into this, and certainly who are not here to honor George Floyd,” Walz said. “So if you are on the streets tonight, it is very clear: You are not with us.” “This is no longer about protesting… This is about violence and we need to make sure that it stops,” Frey said. “We’re in the middle of a pandemic right now.” The protection of citizens and property is the top priority, Walz and Frey confirmed on Saturday. “That situation can be expected to deteriorate further with these people,” Walz said, adding that violent protestors are being fed professional tactics in urban warfare by outside groups.

Right-wing conservatives claim Soros is to blame for the protests.  Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, along with Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, Saint Paul Mayor Melvin Carter and Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, confirmed Saturday that outside forces had infiltrated the protests in order to cause mayhem.  State authorities said they were monitoring alleged criminals online, including posts from suspected white supremacist groups trying to incite violence by promoting looting and mayhem in Minneapolis. But many right-wing conservatives have begun to resurrect an old conspiracy theory about billionaire George Soros—who is a major donor to liberal and progressive causes—to make unsubstantiated claims that he is the mastermind behind organizing protests and riots. Soros has poured billions into his philanthropic Open Society Foundations, which funds projects around the world to advance democracy and also domestically funds politically charged organizations ranging from Planned Parenthood to Black Lives Matter, which are often involved in grassroots protests. Right-wing personality Bill Mitchell, for example, called the protestors “antifa and Soros rent-a-thugs,” urging authorities to “PLEASE just arrest George Soros,” and also claiming that the riots are “100% orchestrated by the DNC.” Former game-show host Chuck Woolery, a frequent conservative commentator on social media, sent out a flurry of unsubstantiated tweets saying George Soros was the source of the civic unrest and had funded “violent anarchy against American cities.” Controversial political activist Candace Owens, an African-American pro-Trump commentator who has spoken out against the Black Lives Matter movement, linked the unrest to anti-facist protestors, citing no evidence: “As he did with Antifa, Democrat George Soros has these thugs on payroll.” DeAnna Lorraine, a Republican former Congressional candidate who ran against Nancy Pelosi, also targeted Soros by name, calling him an “evil tyrant,” and darkly claiming “this is a Takeover. We are being invaded from within.” “The people that are doing this are not Minneapolis residents,” Minneapolis Mayor Frey said of the protests on Saturday. “They are coming in largely from outside of the city, from outside of the region.” Saint Paul Mayor Carter also confirmed that every person arrested in his city last night was from out of state: “We don’t know these folks.” Even President Trump, while not naming Soros, blamed the protests on “ANTIFA and the Radical Left.” Attorney General William Barr, in a statement, similarly condemned “far left extremist groups using Antifa-like tactics” for the civil unrest. He added that government authorities, including the Department of Justice and FBI, will aid local efforts to investigate the out-of-state protestors. Soros, a billionaire whose fortune Forbes estimates at $8.3 billion, has regularly been portrayed as a vast left-wing conspiracy unto himself, with many far-right conservatives often blaming him for liberal protests, like unrest in Ferguson, Missouri; violence in Charlottesville, North Carolina; and the national anthem protests in the NFL. An uncountable number of conspiracy theorists target Soros because of his backing of liberal causes and Democratic super PACs, not to mention for his Open Society Foundation, which has spent billions supporting democracy and human rights in 120 countries around the world. Many far-right commentators and outlets, like Breitbart, regularly portray Soros as a “globalist.” As The Atlantic describes it, "globalist," is, "an anti-Semitic slur, embraced in alt-right circles before spreading into  broader political discourse." And, quoting the Anti-Defamation League’s Jonathan Greenblatt, it refers to "Jewish people who are seen as having allegiances not to their countries of origin like the United States, but to some global conspiracy.” Trump even used the term to describe Soros in his last 2016 campaign ads, which many regarded as anti-semitic. Soros has long been a target: In 2018, a hand-delivered explosive device was found in his mailbox, though nobody was hurt.  Every Person Arrested In Saint Paul Last Night Was From Out Of State, Mayor Says (Forbes) Trump Requests Military Help As Protests Escalate.

(New York Times) Full coverage and live updates on the Coronavirus A Chinese Covid-19 vaccine could be ready by the end of the year, a government body has announced as nations race to be the first to come up with a defense against the virus that has infected nearly 6 million people and wrecked the world economy. A Chinese-state controlled group announced the expect to distribute a Covid-19 vaccine by the end of ... [+] the year. A vaccine developed by two state-affiliated companies working in tandem has the potential to be ready by the tail end of 2020 or by early 2021, according to a social media post made Friday from the Chinese state-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC). The two firms, the Wuhan Institute of Biological Products and the Beijing Institute of Biological Products, have embarked on Phase II testing for the vaccines and administered doses to more than 2,000 people during trials, according to Reuters. According to the SASAC, the Beijing Institute of Biological Products production line will be able to manufacture between 100 million and 120 million vaccine doses per year at full capacity.  There are five Chinese-developed immunizations being tested on humans, more than any other country in the world. China, where the Covid-19 virus is believed to have originated, has its health organizations, regulators, research groups and even smaller private companies teaming up and working overtime in a bid to come up with the world’s first effective Covid-19 vaccine. While Chinese President Xi Jinping has promised to share any successful vaccine with other nations, vaccine manufacturing in China has been marred by production quality issues and safety scandals in the past, according to Bloomberg. The Chinese expectation of a vaccine by the end of 2020 is aggressive compared to previous estimates that a vaccine could be a year away. But this week, Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said that a vaccine for Covid-19 could be ready as early as November as the FDA fast-tracks vaccine trials. The Department of Health and Human Services has already inked contracts to order $100 million worth of needles and syringes for a mass vaccination campaign. According to the World Health Organization, there were more than 100 potential Covid-19 vaccines in preclinical trials and 10 undergoing human trials this week.  The race for a vaccine heats up as tension between the U.S. and China escalates after nearly two years of trade spats. U.S. President Donald Trump attacked China this week, claiming they instigated “the Wuhan virus” and then covered it up. Trump said Friday he will end the U.S. relationship with the WHO, which he has accused of being under Chinese control and complicit in the coverup. He also announced he would implement new sanctions and visa restrictions for officials in China who had a role in Beijing’s new national security bill that critics say will reduce Hong Kong’s autonomy from the mainland.

Instead, humans tend to make choices in these situations using a set of mental shortcuts Getty Images  Most states have reached a pivotal moment, embarking on the path of returning their economies back to normal. Using a phased approach, officials have sanctioned the reopening of select business sectors and expressed their plans for other sectors to follow suit if infection rates remain flat or decline over time. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently affirmed this approach by outlining detailed guidance about data criteria and thresholds for “opening America up again” in three phases.  Recovery requires reliable data and strong public health data surveillance. But human behavior is rarely dictated purely by data. Ultimately it will be the psychology behind Americans’ behaviors that dictates how the country rebounds.  Human behavior has already drastically impacted the healthcare industry. Fears of contracting the virus in medical facilities have plummeted the use of emergency rooms, hospitals and clinics. I cared for patients in Washington state, one of the early epicenters of the pandemic, where hallways were eerily empty in preparation for projected surges, and several patients admitted for non-Covid reasons requested early discharge to avoid exposure to the virus. For hospitals and practices, recovery from this situation is far from certain. Many are furloughing or laying off employees, while others may be beyond saving even with federal financial relief efforts. Behavioral dynamics are also at play on a larger scale. Widespread concerns about the virus may explain why residents in multiple states curtailed work, spending and travel far before their state officials issued formal stay-at-home orders. It is also why over half of Americans would still probably or definitely not engage in activities such as flying on planes or going to the movies, even if restrictions were lifted on the advice of public health officials.  That said, the psychology behind American behavior promises to be much more complex than just fear. People make decisions by weighing social and economic obligations, likely explaining why – in contrast to their unwillingness to engage leisure activities – Americans appear more willing to attend weddings and funerals if public health officials lift restrictions. Additionally, it is also likely why economic hardship has driven some to protest and defy stay-at-home orders, even if it is at the risk of personal and public health.  Though varied, these responses are not surprising to those of us who study human behavior. Under the pressure of time and uncertainty, people rarely act purely based on logic. Instead, humans tend to make choices in these situations using a set of mental shortcuts (called “heuristics” in behavioral and decision science) that are drawn from prior experiences. We use these cognitive strategies to quickly make decisions while minimizing stress. This cognitive approach usually works well for humans, particularly in uncertain situations: choosing whether to drive or take the train to a business conference; deciding whether or not to invest in a time-limited opportunity; or determining a fair salary for negotiating with a prospective employer. Individuals are now facing a new, uncertain situation: choosing activities in the gradual recovery from a global pandemic. Prior experience, memory and mental rules-of-thumb can help people make good decisions. But these tendencies can also work against us. News of a recent train wreck may cause a person to drive to the conference instead of train, despite the relative safety of trains and the known risks of car travel. Positive experiences investing in a particular sector may prompt a person to jump hastily into another seemingly similar, but riskier, investment. Anchoring too heavily on an initial salary target may undercut the productiveness of a negotiation and even harm a person’s job prospects.  And in a global pandemic, distorted perceptions about infection risks can lead Americans – leaders, business owners, employees, and the public alike – away from good decisions and behaviors. For leaders, that determines how they pace reopenings and communicate information to constituents. For business owners and employees, that determines how they about implement policies that preserve workplace productivity and safety. For all of us, that determines what activities that may result in under-engagement (e.g., avoidance even after restrictions are lifted) or over-engagement (e.g., premature rush to restricted activities).  It is no secret that humans can make poor decisions. But it is important to pay attention to the prevalent heuristics that cause us to do so – often in highly predictable ways. As states move to reopen, this recognition could mean the difference between a strategy that focuses on data (hoping that appropriate behavior follows), and one that anticipates and intervenes on faulty behavioral responses alongside data surveillance. What happens in the coming months and years may very well depend on which prevails. Full coverage and live updates on the CoronavirusThe Supreme Court, in a 5-4 decision Friday night, rejected an emergency appeal from a California church that challenged state restrictions on attendance at services during the coronavirus pandemic, amid increasing pressure from religious institutions—and President Trump—to re-open. Chief Justice John Roberts cast the deciding vote in a rare late-night ruling. Chief Justice John Roberts sided with the court’s four other liberal justices to deny the request for intervention from the South Bay United Pentecostal Church in Chula Vista, California. The church had argued that the California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s new limits on in-person services—25% capacity or a maximum of 100 people—discriminate against religion, quoting President Trump’s statement last week that he would “override the governors” if they fail to lift restrictions.  Lower courts had also rejected the church’s challenge to public health orders, and Chief Justice Roberts similarly dismissed the notion of religious discrimination on Friday in a written opinion. The chief justice warned against “second-guessing” state officials and guidelines amid the pandemic, saying that they had leeway to impose restrictions and had not signaled out places of worship for unfair treatment. Liberal justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen G. Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan likewise voted to deny the request, though they did not join the statement from Roberts. The Supreme Court’s four conservative judges—Brett Kavanaugh, Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch and Samual Alito Jr.—said they would have granted the church’s request on the basis that California’s restrictions violate the Constitution’s protection of religious freedom. “Although California’s guidelines place restrictions on places of worship, those restrictions appear consistent with the free exercise clause of the First Amendment,” Roberts said in his three-page written opinion. “Similar or more severe restrictions apply to comparable secular gatherings,” he pointed out. “And the Order exempts or treats more leniently only dissimilar activities, such as operating grocery stores, banks, and laundromats, in which people neither congregate in large groups nor remain in close proximity for extended periods.” “California’s latest safety guidelines discriminate against places of worship and in favor of comparable secular business,” Kavanaugh wrote in a dissent joined by Thomas and Gorsuch. The Supreme Court also turned down another request from several churches outside of Chicago. The separate Illinois case, which is regarded as less-controversial, was rejected without noted dissent.  The court’s ruling is its first attempt to balance the coronavirus crisis against the Constitution's protection of religious freedom. The Supreme Court has similarly ruled on other issues related to the pandemic, including on voting in Wisconsin and prisons in Texas and Ohio. Last week, President Trump urged governors across the country to immediately allow places of worship to reopen, calling them “essential services.” Trump Demands States Reopen Houses Of Worship, Claims Will Override Governors If They Don’t (Forbes) Full coverage and live updates on the CoronavirusAs Twitter has begun to fact-check and add warnings to inaccurate and inflammatory tweets by President Trump, Facebook is taking a hands-off approach, with CEO Mark Zuckerberg explaining Friday why the site didn't flag or outright take down a threat from the president to have the military shoot "looters" amid the Minneapolis protests.

Just spoke to Governor Tim Walz and told him that the Military is with him all the way. Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts. Thank you!" Twitter put the statement behind a warning that it was "glorifying violence," though it still made the message viewable. Facebook, which also owns Instagram, took no action, and late Friday Zuckerberg posted a statement explaining why: "Personally, I have a visceral negative reaction to this kind of divisive and inflammatory rhetoric," but, he wrote, "I'm responsible for reacting not just in my personal capacity but as the leader of an institution committed to free expression." While he previously said Facebook doesn't allow content that "incites violence or risks imminent harm," he said the company left Trump’s message up "because the National Guard references meant we read it as a warning about state action, and we think people need to know if the government is planning to deploy force." Zuckerberg also seemed to argue that Twitter’s reasoning was muddled, writing, "we believe that if a post incites violence, it should be removed regardless of whether it is newsworthy, even if it comes from a politician." Facebook uses third-party fact-checkers but only to "really catch the worst of the worst stuff," Zuckerberg said in an interview on CNBC Thursday, adding, “In terms of political speech, again, I think you want to give broad deference to the political process and political speech.” Trump signed a legally fraught executive order Thursday attempting to limit the liability protections of Internet companies after Twitter added context to an erroneous tweet sent by the president recently regarding California's mail-in voting. Zuckerberg was critical of Twitter, saying on Fox News this week that social media companies "shouldn't be the arbiter of truth." Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey shot back by tweeting, "This does not make us an 'arbiter of truth.' Our intention is to connect the dots of conflicting statements and show the information in dispute so people can judge for themselves." After Zuckerberg's comments on Fox News, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) called them disgraceful on MSNBC. “As far as the platforms are concerned, they want two things from the federal government: no regulation and no taxes. And so they cater to the Trump administration all the time. I think that Mark Zuckerberg's statement was a disgrace.” Trump shared Zuckerberg's statement on Twitter. Trump's shift in focus to regulating social media companies comes amid the coronavirus pandemic and the killing of Floyd in Minneapolis. A video showing a white police officer, Derek Chauvin, pressing his knee into the black man’s neck as he complained he couldn’t breathe went viral on Monday and sparked days of protest, where teargas was shot at demonstrators and a police precinct was set afire Thursday night. Chauvin and three other officers on the scene—Thomas Lane, Tou Thao and J. Alexander Kueng—were fired, and Chauvin was arrested Friday on charges of third-degree murder and manslaughter. The U.S. leads all countries in confirmed cases of the coronavirus with 1,745,606, as well as reported deaths with 102,798.

A photo taken in the late hours of May 29, 2020 shows a sign of the World Health Organization (WHO) ... [+] at their headquarters in Geneva amid the COVID-19 outbreak, caused by the novel coronavirus. Trump on Friday said he will terminate the U.S. relationship with the WHO, which he has accused of being controlled by China and having covered up the spread of the disease in the country. The president said he will redirect WHO funds to other global public health needs, but there are questions as to whether Trump has the legal authority to withdraw funds from the WHO without authorization from Congress. Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor University, told Forbes the move will make it harder for the WHO to coordinate drug trials for treatments and vaccines as well as combat the pandemic in developing countries.  Outside the coronavirus, Trump’s actions threaten the WHO’s efforts to provide expertise and coordination on health issues including polio, tuberculosis, HIV and malaria.  Not participating in WHO decisionmaking would also ensure the U.S. loses its “seat at the table in shaping global practices and guidelines, crisis response operations, and partnerships,” said the Center For Global Development, a think tank focusing on reducing global inequality. The military’s Africa Command is also concerned that withdrawing WHO funding could be used by China to expand its influence in Africa, the Nation reported.  “I was just disgusted that we would terminate the relationship with WHO at a time when the only way we’re going to solve the Covid-19 pandemic is through the closer links to the WHO for international cooperation around disease control and vaccine development,” Hotez said. 15%, that’s the share of the WHO’s budget covered by the U.S, making it the organization’s largest contributor.  Public health experts have criticized Trump for his coronavirus response, including the administration’s failure to ramp up testing in the early days of the pandemic and continuing to praise hydroxychloroquine, an unproven drug that may put patients in danger.

[+] George Washington University Hospital. As Covid-19 coronavirus testing becomes more abundant and accessible—more than 15 million have been administered across the U.S. to date—so do questions about the various testing locations and types of tests being offered. But when you’re trying to discover this information, it’s not always easy to come by. “At the onset of a pandemic, there was a lack of information sharing as well as a scarcity of certain resources,” says Dylan Cahill, a first-year student at Harvard Medical. “Early on we were thinking there might be some way in which we could create some sort of a crowdsourcing platform that would help connect people with these resources.” This thought led Cahill and his friend J.C. Panagides, also a first-year med student at Harvard, to develop a way for people to get better information about coronavirus testing. More than half of Americans are turning to the Internet for essential guidance throughout the pandemic, but Cahill and Panagides wanted to ensure testing site information was accurate, relatable and, above all, first-hand.  The duo launched both the mobile and desktop version of their Covid-19 testing location app on March 17. Their initial aim was simply to provide information about where testing sites were located. “Our intentions were to track the location and operational capacity of sites as they opened around the country at a time when it was almost impossible to find a testing location or get specific, up to date information about that site,” Cahill. Starting May 1, Cahill and Panagides expanded the information their site offered, asking people receiving coronavirus tests to share more about their experience, including details like waiting times and doctor-patient rapport. So far, some 50 reviews have come in from 16 states in locations mostly in the New England, Southeast, and West Coast areas. Groopit's Covid-19 testing review app. “There’s a lot of value in people sharing their personal stories and experiences,” says Cahill. “Other people can read these stories and experiences and better know things like what they should have prepared for [testing] or how much time out of their day they should budget, and even understand the emotional side.” To help build the platform, Cahill and Panagides sought assistance from Groopit. The Seattle-based crowdsolving service, which launched in 2018 and is backed by LinkedIn, PayPal, 23&Me, and Microsoft investors, works with customers interested in collecting real-time data about things like activist engagement, environmental monitoring and violence prevention. Because the company was already working with health-related scenarios, its software is HIPAA compliant, meaning it adheres to medical privacy and security regulations. That was a big leg up in helping develop their platform, Panagides says.  Since the start of the pandemic, gathering virus-related information has been a popular request among new clients, says Groopit CEO and cofounder Tammy Savage. A group of neighborhood associations in Nebraska, for example, are using Groopit’s services to share and compare Covid-19 data and identify local volunteers. “The problem that we're solving 30 days from now is probably not exactly the problem that we're solving today,” says Savage. “One of the really important things about crowdsolving is that you can adjust in the moment and you’re always contributing the most important information in real-time and solving those problems in real-time.” Cahill and Panagides are keeping in mind the long term benefits of their real-time data, and are confident it'll be useful in helping shape future coronavirus research.  “These sorts of details could be helpful for policymakers and public health officials who monitor trends—seeing what people are saying, what is working, what isn't and the gaps that need to be addressed,” says Cahill. Full coverage and live updates on the Coronavirus Greece will welcome international tourists from nearly 30 countries back in June, but will retain a ban on holidaymakers from countries with high Covid-19 infection rates like the United States, the Greek government announced. Greece will begin permitting some foreign tourists in June.  Visitors from 29 permitted countries will be able to enter Greece via direct flights to Athens and to Thessaloniki, a city in the north starting June 15, the Greek Tourism Ministry said Friday. Americans will not be allowed back in just yet, as Greece will continue to block travelers from countries with high Covid-19 infection rates. Countries like the U.K., Brazil and Sweden have also not received the go-ahead for their residents to have a Greek vacation until at least July, when the tourism ministry said they hoped to expand their list of approved countries to include more.  For those allowed to enter, Greece will implement measures to keep visitors and Greeks safe, like capacity limits and designated doctors for hotels, while visitors will be subject to random Covid-19 testing, according to Reuters. Greek officials are eager to attract travelers in time for the peak of the summer holiday season, as tourism makes up about a fifth of the Greek economy. Roughly 33 million visitors brought in about $21 billion to Greece in 2019. “Our aim is to be able to welcome every tourist who has overcome their fear and has the ability to travel to our country,” Minister of Tourism Harry Theoharis said on a Greek television station Friday. Greece has been praised for largely controlling its Covid-19 outbreak, thanks in part to ordering a lock down early on. On Friday, Greece had counted 175 deaths and just less than 3,000 confirmed cases, and no infections have been found on most of the country’s islands, a popular holiday destination. Greece’s move to open to international travelers follows the same decision by Italy and Spain, two vacation spots that also depend on tourist spending.

The United States will also terminate its relationship with the World Health Organization, Trump said, adding that China has “total control” over the WHO. The moves came in response to Beijing’s new national security bill for Hong Kong, which reduces the city’s autonomy from mainland China. The market rebounded sharply following Trump’s announcement, with the S&P 500 turning positive, after it became clear that the phase one trade deal with China would remain intact. U.S. consumer spending plunged by a record 13.6% in April, more than the 12.9% expected, according to new data Friday. The U.S. savings rate, on the other hand, surged 33% to an all-time high as more Americans stockpiled cash and cut back on spending amid the pandemic. JPMorgan

  strategist Marko Kolanovic, who correctly predicted the market’s recovery in late March, warned investors to be more cautious about stocks because of a possible economic clash with China. “A complete breakdown of supply chains and international trade, primarily between the two largest economies (U.S. and China), would justify equities trading drastically lower,” Kolanovic said in a recent note. Rising U.S.-China tensions could threaten the market’s recent rally. Trade fears have escalated as both countries continue to blame each other for spreading the coronavirus pandemic. Trump has criticized the Chinese government’s response to the outbreak and has repeatedly touted a controversial theory that the virus originated in a Wuhan lab. U.S. lawmakers have also increasingly pushed back on China increasing its grip over Hong Kong. Earlier on Friday, the White House’s top economic advisor, Larry Kudlow, told Fox News that the U.S. government is “furious” with China’s behavior in recent weeks. On Wednesday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo confirmed to Congress that Hong Kong is no longer “politically autonomous” from China. The United States wants an “open and constructive relationship” with China, Trump said on Friday, but added that because Beijing has broken its promises, the U.S. will defend its national interests. Shares of Twitter continued to fall on Friday, after President Trump signed an executive order targeting social media platforms late on Thursday. The move comes after Twitter for the first time fact-checked some of Trump’s tweets, prompting outrage from the president. Trump first announced the news conference regarding China late on Thursday, causing stocks to tumble—the Dow gave up 300 points—and turn negative in the final hour of trading. While the market was down for most of Friday, the major averages sharply cut their losses right before the press conference, following a report from Bloomberg which said that Trump would not scrap the phase one trade deal. The market is still up for the week, thanks to increasing optimism on Wall Street over a successful reopening of the economy and a potential coronavirus vaccine. Stocks broke back above two crucial milestones on Wednesday that show the market’s recovery from the coronavirus downturn in late March. The Dow closed above 25,000 and the S&P closed above 3,000, both for the first time since March.

(Forbes) Full coverage and live updates on the CoronavirusIn an increasingly confrontational approach to China, President Trump announced new targeted sanctions against Chinese officials on Friday and directed his administration to revoke special trade exemptions for Hong Kong, though he said he would keep a phase one trade deal with China intact. “We will take action to revoke Hong Kong’s preferential treatment,” Trump said. Trump announced that he would impose new sanctions and visa restrictions on Chinese officials who played a role in “smothering” Hong Kong’s freedom, while also directing his administration to end the city’s preferential treatment, separate from China, in customs, trade and travel.  The move comes in response to Beijing’s new national security bill for Hong Kong, which reduces the city’s autonomy from mainland China. China unilaterally imposed control over Hong Kong’s national security, Trump said: “China is abandoning of idea of ‘One country, two systems’ in favor of ‘one country, one system.’” The United States will also terminate its relationship with the World Health Organization, Trump announced, claiming that China has “total control” over the WHO. Trump cited his belief that China has engaged in a cover up of “the Wuhan virus,” accusing the country of instigating the global pandemic that has killed millions. Stocks had been falling for most of the day as Wall Street braced for Trump’s press conference: The Dow was plunged by around 250 points on fears that the president would either impose new sanctions or trade penalties. Stocks rebounded sharply and turned positive after Trump’s announcement, however, as it became clear that he would not pull the U.S. out of the phase one trade deal with China.  “This is a tragedy for the people of Hong Kong, the people of China and indeed the people of the world,” Trump said. The United States wants an “open and constructive relationship” with China, he said, but added that because Beijing has broken its promises, the U.S. will defend its national interests.

Full coverage and live updates on the CoronavirusIn a Friday press conference on relations between the United States and China, President Trump announced he's terminating the country's relationship with the World Health Organization amid the Covid-19 coronavirus pandemic—but also refused to take questions from the media, avoiding any discussion of his controversial “shooting” tweet about protests in Minneapolis. President Donald Trump speaks in the Rose Garden of the White House, Friday, May 29, 2020, in ... [+] Washington. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon) In April, Trump put a 60-90 day hold on U.S. funding to the WHO, accusing it of "severely mismanaging and covering up" the outbreak. On Friday, he accused the WHO of misleading the world due to pressure from China, though Trump himself praised the country for its transparency up into March and did not make major moves in February to address the oncoming pandemic. Trump did not take questions after his statements, which follows protests in Minneapolis over the killing of 46-year-old George Floyd while being taken into police custody. Amid the Minneapolis protests Thursday night, Trump threatened in a tweet with historically racial connotations, "When the looting starts, the shooting starts." Right before his press conference on Friday, Trump attempted to backpedal, linking his threat against demonstrators to the seven people shot during a protest in Louisville, Kentucky Thursday night, saying "It was spoken as a fact, not as a statement" and that the only people that should have a problem with it are "the haters and those looking to cause trouble on social media." Derek Chauvin, the former officer who is seen on video with his knee pressed against Floyd's neck as he says "I can't breathe," was taken into custody by state authorities Friday afternoon and charged with murder and manslaughter, though the three other arresting officers who were relieved on their positions have not yet been arrested. Key background: A video of Floyd's death while being held down by a white police officer in Minneapolis went viral on Monday. Chauvin, along with former officers Thomas Lane, Tou Thao and J. Alexander Kueng, arrested Floyd on suspicions that he used a counterfeit $20 bill at a convenience store. Local, state and federal authorities are investigating the incident, which was filmed by a bystander. Protests began soon after, with teargas being shot at unarmed demonstrators and a police precinct being set afire Thursday night. These events are all occurring during the ongoing Covid-19 coronavirus pandemic. The United States leads the world in confirmed cases of the virus with 1,729,185 and in reported deaths with 101,963. News Peg: Amid the killing of Floyd and the pandemic, Trump has shifted his focus toward Twitter's new policy of fact-checking select tweets. On Thursday, after Twitter added context to an inaccurate claim he made about absentee ballots in California, Trump signed a legally fraught executive order attempting to curtail liability protections for Internet companies under Section 230. During the signing, Trump admitted that it would probably be challenged in court and any new regulations would likely require the cooperation of Congress. Twitter subsequently added a disclaimer to his protest tweets, saying it "violated the Twitter Rules about glorifying violence" but that it would keep it accessible for "the public's interest," with Trump later tweeting "REVOKE 230!" Crucial Quote: “I did not know that he was going to tweet. He certainly can. It's just not helpful. It's not helpful," Minnesota Governor Tim Walz said of Trump's comments on Twitter. Chief Critics: Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) called Trump’s executive order a distraction in a statement Thursday. “Clearly and sadly, the president’s executive order is a desperate distraction from his failure to provide a national testing strategy to defeat Covid-19." Regarding the defunding of the WHO, billionaire Bill Gates, one of its largest voluntary donors, said in April that the move is "as dangerous as it sounds...the world needs WHO now more than ever." Responding to Trump's tweets, including the assertion that he's "very weak," Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey on Friday said, "Weakness is refusing to take responsibility for your actions. Weakness is pointing your finger at somebody else during a time of crisis." Full coverage and live updates on the CoronavirusElderly ill woman and healthy caregiver wearing face masks to protect against coronavirus. People aren't equally susceptible to coronavirus disease. We know relatively little about which factors influence the severity of symptoms you would experience if infected by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The elderly are especially vulnerable, for example, but the reasons why are a lot more complex than a weaker immune system. Medical researchers have now identified one factor that influences your risk of severe disease: a variant of the gene 'APOE', which is associated with dementia. You normally inherit two copies of this 'dementia gene' (one from each parent), which comes in variants that include e3 and e4. Among individuals of European ancestry, the most common APOE genotype is two copies of the e3 variant, e3/e3, which isn't linked to dementia. But in around 1 in 36 'Europeans', both copies are e4 (you have the letter 'C' instead of 'T' in your DNA) and the gene produces a faulty APOE protein. This variant is a common genetic factor associated with late-onset Alzheimer's disease. According to the new study, people who carry APOE e4/e4 have twice the risk of developing severe COVID-19 (when compared to those with e3/e3), as discovered after scanning the UK Biobank, a database containing DNA sequences from half a million volunteers. I understand more than most about APOE after having my whole genome sequenced. Reading every letter in my DNA revealed that I have one copy of each APOE variant (my immediate ancestors originated from Asia via Africa). Note that if, like me, you carry the e3/e4 combination of APOE variants, it's unlikely you'll be at higher risk of severe COVID-19 because a working gene can often make enough protein to compensate for the other, faulty variant. By analogy, missing one functional gene isn't like a car you can't drive because it's missing a wheel, but like a broken headlamp — the working light will still let you see the road in the dark. The new analysis was published in the Journal of Gerontology: Medical Sciences and carried out by researchers at the University of Exeter in the UK and the University of Connecticut in the US. The two teams previously showed that those with dementia are three times more likely to suffer from severe COVID-19. That result could potentially be explained by older people having an increased chance of exposure to the virus in care homes, however. The new research suggests a genetic factor is also involved. Of the 382,188 participants in the BioBank with European ancestors, 9022 (2.4%) carry the faulty e4/e4 genotype. And of the 721 individuals who tested positive for coronavirus, 37 (5.1%) also have those genetic variants of ApoE. APOE stands for 'apolipoprotein E' and, as the lipid part of its name implies, the gene produces a protein that enables our bodies to transport cholesterol and other kinds of fat through the bloodstream — which is why variants of this so-called 'dementia gene' are also associated with cardiovascular conditions. This highlights how faulty APOE genes can have knock-on effects beyond the blood and brain — including the body's response to COVID-19. The study was led by epidemiologist David Melzer, who emphasised that the greater vulnerability to severe disease isn't just down to ageing — genetic predisposition also plays a part. "This high risk may not simply be due to the effects of dementia, advancing age or frailty, or exposure to the virus in care homes. The effect could be partly due to this underlying genetic change, which puts them at risk for both COVID-19 and dementia." Full coverage and live updates on the CoronavirusNew York Governor Andrew Cuomo said in a press conference on Friday that his state is coming “close” to the bottom of the curve, with five regions now set to begin a phase 2 reopening. Most of the states regions have begun a phase 1 reopening. The number of coronavirus hospitalizations, intubations and new cases were all down again on Friday, Cuomo said, which continues to be good news. Another 67 New Yorkers died from the virus, which is down from 74 deaths in the previous day. The daily death toll continues to decline, hitting its “lowest level ever,” Cuomo said. “We hope and we pray that continues to be the case.” 5 upstate New York regions will now enter a phase 2 reopening, Cuomo confirmed on Friday: “Their data has been reviewed and the experts say to us it’s safe to move forward.” Those regions that will enter phase 2 include: Central New York, North Country, Finger Lakes, Southern Tier and the Mohawk Valley. Phase 2 allows offices, stores and personal-service businesses like barber shops to reopen, but with restrictions. The New York City region, which will be “more complicated” to reopen, is on track to enter phase 1 on June 8, Cuomo said. Gov. Cuomo announced a new executive order on Thursday that allows businesses to deny entry to customers who don’t wear masks or face coverings. Almost all of New York’s regions, except for New York City, have so far qualified for a phase 1 reopening after meeting seven metrics outlined by state health officials. The Long Island and Mid-Hudson regions began their phase one reopening earlier this week.  New York City, which was hardest-hit by the pandemic, will be the last in the state to open: It currently only meets four out of the seven criteria required by the state to begin a phase 1 reopening. That’s how many cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in New York as of Friday, according to Johns Hopkins University.

The ... [+] Panthers made two playoff appearances under coach Steve Englehart. Steve Englehart arrived at Florida Tech less than a decade ago to launch a football program and fulfill the many dreams that go along with it. Those dreams morphed into realities and created memories that will not fade anytime soon, though those memories span a timeline all too short. “I showed up here in 2011 with nothing more than a bunch of ideas and hopes that this place could be what I thought it could be,” he said. “That would be a Division II goldmine knowing that we were the only Division II program in the state of Florida at the time. We would have a great location for recruiting and all those things. That’s why we were able to be successful so quickly.” The Panthers took the field in 2013 and went 5-7. In their first game they defeated visiting Stetson 20-13, with the outcome mirroring their inaugural year. In 2014, they traveled to Texas and toppled No. 12 Tarleton State at AT&T Stadium. The next season the Panthers continued to realize their dreams when they shattered those of No. 1 West Georgia on Senior Day. “To beat the No. 1 team in the country was huge,” said Englehart. “It was like, ‘Wow, we may have arrived.’ That was our sixth victory in the row and it was only our third year.” Memorable wins yielded memorable seasons as Tech advanced to the playoffs in 2016 and 2018. Alas, a 42-3 win over fellow Gulf South Conference member Shorter University to close out the 2019 season proved to be the final chapter in the Panthers’ seven seasons.  "Indeed, all of higher education is struggling to deal with the realities of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the uncertainty that accompanies a global disruption to daily life,” president T. Dwayne McKay said in a message posted on the school’s website May 11. “Some universities will no doubt close. Florida Tech, however, has plans to persevere." In order to achieve that last point, the administration felt it had to make several cuts across in academics and athletics, including eliminating the football program. “It’s tough because it came as such a surprise,” said Englehart, whose assistants over the past seven years included former Cincinnati head coach and Notre Dame defensive coordinator Rick Minter, who served as the Panthers’ DC in 2017 and 2018. “You watch the Michael Jordan documentary, The Last Dance, and I kind of wish (the administration) would have given us a last dance where they said, ‘We can’t do it anymore, but we’re going to give you this year and understand at the end of the season you’re done.’” There will be no such gridiron finale at the private school founded in 1958. Located in Melbourne, about 20 miles south of Cape Canaveral, the school had close to 5,000 undergraduate and graduate students on the main campus in fall 2019.  “You never want to have a program go down, especially when it has been successful and with a great bunch of people running it,” said interim athletic director Pete Mazzone, who became Florida Tech’s associate athletic director in 1985 and coaches men’s and women’s track and cross country. “Coach Englehart did a fantastic job, he and his staff. To build a program from scratch and have that kind of success at a private university, an academically-driven university, then you’ve done a very good job.” According to the U.S. Department of Education, Florida Tech’s football program accounted for $3.1 million, or about 30% of the athletic department’s $10.7 million in expenses during the 2018-19 fiscal year. It was a fiscal year in which many cracks surfaced as the school dropped its men’s and women’s tennis and women’s golf programs.  As with those student-athletes, the 120 affected by the loss of football will have their scholarships honored up to four years. Englehart noted that several of them have opportunities to play elsewhere, including six or seven that could sign with Division I programs. One of them, linebacker Evan Thompson, committed to FAU ten days after Florida Tech shuttered its program.  Thompson said he immediately heard from nearly 100 football coaches with 10 making an offer to resume his career. Football Bowl Subdivision programs other than FAU to contact him were Temple and Liberty.  Linebacker Evan Thompson led Florida Tech in tackles, tackles for loss and sacks in 2019. He will ... [+] play his final season of college football at FAU. The 5-foot-11 and 212-pound Thompson, who has one year of eligibility remaining, led the team last season in tackles (89), tackles for loss (13) and sacks (5.5). At FAU, which is about 135 miles down the coast from Melbourne, he will play for coach Willie Taggart and defensive coordinator Jim Leavitt, both in their first years at the school.  “It’s a dream come true,” he said of the opportunity to play for the Owls, who won a pair of Conference USA championships the past three years under Lane Kiffin. “I didn’t have the accolades or achievements to go there out of high school and I would never have expected this to happen. The thing I am most excited about is joining coach Leavitt’s defense. I can’t wait to get down there and play for the new coaching staff.” Football was far from the only thing for Thompson, who grew up outside Orlando, to consider in committing to FAU. He is also a golfer and because this past season was cut short due to the pandemic, he will have two years of eligibility on the links. At FAU he will be able to complete his undergraduate studies (entrepreneurship with a minor in sustainability) prior to going for his master’s.  “When I first decided I was transferring, the school I wanted to attend was one where I can complete my undergrad and play my final season of football and also do my graduate studies and play my final two years of golf,” said Thompson, who noted the family-type relationship among Panthers players and coaches is what he will miss most about his time at Florida Tech. “FAU was the one that stood out the most. It worked out perfectly.” While Thompson has the next chapter in his college career lined up, other players are sorting out the many details, including kicker Trey Schaneville. Like Thompson, the Melbourne native is a two-sport athlete as he is also a guard on the Panthers’ basketball team.  Schaneville, who as a freshman in 2018 set the school mark by making 15 field goals (20 attempts), is undecided as to where the remainder of his college career will play out. He has heard from several schools and if he moves on, Valdosta State, which is interested in him for both sports, is a potential landing spot.  For football only, Schaneville heard from Football Championship Subdivision member Gardner-Webb.  “I have a couple of options to transfer, but I am not sure if I am leaving yet,” said Schaneville, who noted one of his career highlights was an overtime field goal that defeated North Greenville last season. “Valdosta State offered me for both football and basketball, so that is an option I  am strongly considering.”   While Thompson is set with what’s next and Schaneville is among those weighing their options, many football careers have come to an end. Trent Chmelik, who totaled 3,041 yards as the Panthers’ starting quarterback in 2018 and one season of eligibility remaining, will not be moving on.  “He had one year left and is in grad school,” said Englehart, of the fifth-year senior from Clearwater. “He is not going to play his final season because he wants to stay and complete his master’s.”  As for Englehart, who was a quarterback at Indiana State in the late ’90s and served as offensive coordinator at his alma mater before arriving at Florida Tech, he is taking this time to look at career options outside of football while leaving the door open to remaining in the game. “I am in wait-and-see mode,” he said. “I have always had interests in other areas, but with coaching and putting in 90-hour weeks you rarely have time to do other things. I am going to take some time to explore opportunities in business and investment-type areas and see where it goes. Who knows? I may get back into football.” Full coverage and live updates on the CoronavirusA deadly disease caused paralysis in decision-making at the top and misinformation to spread on social media—in a simulated epidemic from September 2019 that provides hard lessons for today. Benjamin Davies led an epidemic simulation in September 2019 that has eerie parallels to the current ... [+] pandemic. In September 2019, Benjamin Davies, who creates war games for the U.S. Naval War College, designed a simulated epidemic to improve crisis management among experts who combat similar situations in real life. In the simulation, an infectious disease spread through a densely populated city with 21 million people and pockets of inequality that became a hotbed for contagion. Those who contracted the virus suffered a cough and a raging fever that led to respiratory failure. Even when a cure was developed, authorities couldn’t prevent a cascade of failures. Of course, Davies wasn’t thinking of the current coronavirus pandemic when he created the game. He had another infectious disease in mind, namely Ebola. But the results of that simulation provide insight into what’s going wrong in the response to the Covid-19. The simulation’s goal was for participants to act as they would in their real-life roles in the event of a similar threat. To make it as accurate as possible, the US Naval War College teamed up with the National Center for Disaster Medicine and Public Health and the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory and brought together 50 stakeholders from organizations, many of which are now responding to the Covid-19 pandemic. Experts from the State Department, the US Health and Human Services and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) came to Laurel, Maryland for the two-day workshop in September, along with representatives of the private sector and NGOs. “We wanted to identify risks and come up with ideas to remedy decision paralysis,” Davies says. No one expected the war game become reality so soon. “The timing is uncanny,” says Captain Alexander Soukhanov, director of Moran Cyber Shipping and a simulation participant. What the simulation unearthed was a dynamic that hampered effective crisis management: a preference for inaction.  The idea of the “Urban Outbreak 2019” simulation came to Davies and his colleagues at a civilian-military humanitarian workshop, when they realized there was surprisingly little written about disaster response in big cities. Response to epidemics has been professionalized for rural environments, but cities create a unique challenge because they operate in some ways like a living organism, where different organs interact. The simulation’s aim was to identify risks in such a dangerous scenario and work out ideas to overcome them. The simulation began with the World Health Organization (WHO) declaring a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. A fictional virus called P.ashlii spread with a high reproduction value, induced flu-like symptoms and caused a small part of the population to wind up in intensive care. Over 90,000 infected with P.ashlii died. Ironically, some experts invited to the war game found this storyline unrealistic, and so the war game had to be toned down before the simulation began. Months later, it has become clear to these researchers that a learning opportunity to prepare for a pandemic was lost.  Phase One: A Chaotic Response The first weeks of the simulation were geared to be the time for relevant agencies and organizations to gather information and work out who is in charge. “The first five steps in mitigating an outbreak are far more important, than the last 50 moves,” says Davies. What the simulation unearthed instead was a dynamic that hampered effective crisis management: a preference for inaction. Players from the military and government agencies were quick to provide reasons why they could not act, according to a summary report of the simulation. They also avoided getting involved with the affected population, preferring instead to work on coordination with each other, notes Davies. “The big fear was that we wouldn't coordinate enough, or we wouldn't follow the right command and control structure, or we wouldn't be creating a great common operating picture,” he says. Representatives of the CDC, the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the US Agency for International Development (USAID) were more concerned with “nebulous high-level policy issues,” according to the summary report, and focused more on details about the command structure. These representatives actively avoided discussing how to distribute the antibiotics needed to heal the disease in favor of bureaucratic issues. Frontline healthcare workers and first responders participating in the simulation, were considered to be a better source of realistic assessment, according to Davies, and were frustrated with the response of the military and USAID. “Health care workers don’t need to waste time discussing coordination – our mission is the population in front of us,” humanitarians said in the summary report. Phase Two: Misinformation And Supply Shortages “The bug exploded in the second phase” of the exercise, Davies says, which simulated the third month of the outbreak. By this time misinformation was spreading in the population about the fictional disease. One element designed by the researcher was that many in the public believed the government was using the outbreak to kill slum dwellers and take back land.  Short supplies in medical equipment and the failing medical system created ripple effects in the simulation, both good and bad. For example, there was a lot of generosity and donations among the simulated public. But the outbreak exacerbated existing deficiencies, too. Debt, spousal abuse and drug problems ticked up. Health systems and supply chains started to collapse, public services became intermittent, and hoarding and theft led to extremely lucrative black markets.  Participants had to rely on themselves when there was no guidance or authority coming from the federal government.  As a consequence, the risk for certain population groups would rise. Within the simulation, Davies constructed game scenarios which sound realistic in the current pandemic. If ambulances couldn’t handle the high number of emergency calls, people started taking informal transportation and cabs to get to the hospital. But cab drivers didn’t necessarily want to serve as ambulances, so only a handful were simulated to be willing to take the risk, though the number grew as it became more lucrative to give rides.  “It’s a race to the bottom in terms of risk for the cab driver,” Davies says.  Davies observed another behavior that he’s seeing again in the current pandemic. While professionals in charge of responding to an outbreak are the best in their field, they don’t feel confident about making large scale decisions affecting so many levels. “The hard part about a pandemic is that it requires us all to get out of our expertise,” he says. An epidemiologist doesn’t just make strictly medical decisions, but also has to consider their feasibility and economic implications. If those decisions don’t get made, a leadership vacuum can emerge, leading to hesitation and confusion.  As the simulation progressed, Davies observed that national government agencies “pretty much abdicated any interest in this city out of political paralysis.” Within the gameplay, this meant that participants had to rely on themselves when there was no guidance or authority coming from the federal government. “The truly scary thing for many people is probably that they themselves are the best response there is,” says Davies. Government paralysis made non-governmental organizations and the private sector stand out in the game, because it was clear that they couldn’t do their work without engaging those, who were affected by the outbreak. “NGOs are used to being independent and making decisions with little or no support,” says Davies. For Alex Soukhanov, a long-time logistics professional, exercises such as this are nothing out of the ordinary. He and his company’s global network don’t only meet in times of crisis. Many industries have built up global networks which are regularly mobilized to mitigate risks, he says. “If there is a risk for one member, there is a risk for all,” he says about the security of supply chains.  Phase Three: Aftermath When the disease finally stopped spreading,  participants were left working to recover the economy, coping with still-ongoing public health emergencies, burying their dead. Davies was surprised to see that players blindly accepted the data they were given.   In the end phase of the simulation, there were 90,000 bodies in one city that needed to be buried or disposed of. “Everyone just took it as given, that people could do this,” says Davies. The Red Cross Movements took the role of mortuary affairs, but they had never been asked to dispose of 90,000 bodies in three months. This showed that even an established organization may not be able to scale its capacity in the extreme circumstances created by an outbreak.  In the final round, the reported number of infections fell dramatically. Though the reports given the players never clearly indicated the reason for this decline, many of them thought this reflected their successful response. Davies expected players to question the reliability of the numbers, and was surprised to see that players blindly accepted the data they were given.  What The Simulation Teaches Us Davies was surprised that the simulation revealed players blindly accepting data, and that people in ... [+] charge had a preference for inaction. The scale of the Urban Outbreak 2019 in the mythical city of Olympia cannot be compared to a real-life pandemic like Covid-19. The phases of crisis management and dynamics of response in the game, however, can help participants better understand what affected countries are going through. One problem that Davies took away from this is: “We’re too networked.” What he means is that unlike the “Urban Outbreak 2019” or other humanitarian crisis that might be localized, the high number of countries affected by Covid-19 creates a unique situation. According to Davies, the usual progression of humanitarian response assumes an overwhelmed country can request support from somewhere else. That assumption breaks down when a crisis is global.   “Under the current circumstances everybody is for themselves,” he says. Italy’s first desperate requests for medical supplies in mid-March remained unheard by its European neighbors, who feared shortages of masks and ventilators in their countries. While the Italian government eventually received help from some states, this experience goes to show that countries can’t necessarily rely on international partners to step in and help during a pandemic. Despite all this, Davies sees a grim silver lining to Covid-19. According to data from the World Health Organization, previous epidemics have involved diseases that kill at a far higher rate: Ebola has an approximate case-fatality rate of 50%, MERS has a 34% case-fatality rate and smallpox kills 30% of the infected and is more contagious than the Covid-19. With those numbers in his head, Davies says the current crisis could have been worse. “I am happy we’re not facing a pandemic with an even deadlier virus,” he says.

Misra, a former Deutsche Bank debt trader, has overseen a period of historic losses for SoftBank’s Vision Fund, in which major bets on companies like WeWork, Uber and hotel chain Oyo have all soured.  The Vision Fund reported a record-breaking loss of $18 billion earlier this month, with the overall SoftBank group posting an operating loss of $13 billion. The Japanese investing conglomerate has been forced to write down its valuation on WeWork from $47 billion in 2019 to just $2.9 billion, while Uber’s valuation has fallen over $10 billion in the past year. Experts think that against the backdrop of SoftBank’s dismal performance, Misra’s compensation package is certainly “high,” and it’s “hard to see how it could be based on performance,” Morningstar analyst Dan Baker told CNN. Misra is now the second-highest paid SoftBank employee, behind only Marcelo Claure, the former chairman of telecom giant Sprint who received an annual salary of almost $20 million—a 17% increase from last year. SoftBank CEO and founder Masayoshi Son, who has a net worth of $23.5 billion according to Forbes, saw his own executive pay fall 9% to $1.9 million. Whether SoftBank’s $108 billion Vision Fund 2 will still go ahead as planned. The second Vision Fund is up and running, but with only $38 billion from the SoftBank Group itself. Son has said that he won’t try to raise capital from outside investors until companies in Vision Fund 1 start performing better. At SoftBank’s earnings presentation earlier this month, Son said that he expects 15 companies in the Vision Fund’s portfolio of 88 companies to go bankrupt. As the investing conglomerate struggles to steady some of its businesses amid the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic, SoftBank has so far written down valuations on a total of 47 companies in the Vision Fund.

PCR tests are precise, but they can also detect the presence of the virus well after it's no longer ... [+] contagious. To date, the majority of patients with Covid-19 have been diagnosed using a laboratory test called PCR, which detects the virus’ genetic material (i.e., RNA) in clinical samples (e.g., nasal swabs). PCR is a very sensitive laboratory method – meaning it can detect minute amounts of viral RNA – and has been used for nearly 2 decades to diagnose a variety of infectious diseases, including influenza and strep throat. Despite being a rapid and inherently sensitive test, PCR has certain limitations that need to be carefully considered when interpreting the results. One of those key limitations of PCR is its inability to determine whether a patient is infectious, or not. This is because the test is designed to detect the virus’ RNA, which is generally present when a virus is causing an active infection. However, RNA can also be present, and therefore, detected by PCR after a virus has broken down (i.e., become non-infectious) and released its genome into host cells or body fluids. From prior experience with other infectious diseases, we know that PCR tests can be positive for days or weeks after a patient has recovered from the illness and is no longer infectious. As more testing is being performed for Covid-19, we are learning that some patients can test positive for weeks following their initial diagnosis. A recent study showed that 16% of patients with Covid-19 continued to test positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA up to 24 days after resolution of symptoms and discharge from the hospital. In addition, some Covid-19 patients who recover from their illness and test negative by PCR may again test positive (i.e., go from PCR positive to negative to positive). So does this mean they never fully recovered? Are they still infectious? Or did they become reinfected with a new strain of the virus? Here are some things to understand. RNA from SARS-CoV-2 might be found in your body long after you've recovered from the disease. Even though they inform isolation and return-to-work decisions, PCR tests don’t measure if someone is contagious When an individual tests positive for Covid-19, it is a common policy to require that they remain in isolation for a period of 10-14 days. In fact, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that those who test positive for Covid-19 remain in isolation until they have received two negative PCR results on samples collected at least 24 hours apart.  This is a conservative approach, but has been justified during the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic due to the lack of data on the period of infectiousness of SARS-CoV-2, as well as the significant repercussions of allowing an infected individual to return-to-work or interact with others before there is confidence they are no longer infectious. However, PCR is not typically used as a ‘test of cure’ for other infectious diseases, since it can remain positive after a patient has cleared an infection. What does it mean when a patient tests positive after recovering from Covid-19? While studies are being performed to definitively answer this question, new data are emerging that suggest the period of SARS-CoV-2 infectiousness may not correlate with PCR positivity. In other words, an individual may not be able to infect others for as long as they test positive by PCR. To determine this, researchers have investigated two important questions. First, can the virus be cultured, or grown, from samples that are collected weeks after resolution of a patient’s symptoms but test positive by PCR? And second, do close contacts (e.g., family members, coworkers) of patients with persistently positive PCR tests become sick with Covid-19?  Last week, the South Korean CDC published important data aimed at addressing these questions. The study followed approximately 800 contacts of Covid-19 patients after they had recovered from their illness, tested negative, but once again tested positive by PCR. The researchers found no evidence that the contacts became ill with Covid-19. In addition, the South Korean scientists were unable to grow the virus from samples that were PCR positive at the latest time point. Although these results suggest that Covid-19 patients may not be infectious for weeks or months following resolution of their symptoms, the exact timeframe over which an individual can transmit the virus to others remains unclear. Additional studies are needed to better define the period of viral infectivity, so that we can prevent the spread of Covid-19 but allow recovered patients the opportunity to emerge from isolation as soon as it is safe to do so. Full coverage and live updates on the CoronavirusA signboard of payments Apple Pay is seen in Causeway Bay. 21AUG17 SCMP / Sam Tsang (Photo by Sam ... [+] Tsang/South China Morning Post via Getty Images) For most people, the effect of Covid-19 on the body is temporary. A dry cough. Fever. Shortness of breath. Then recovery. But the way the pandemic has altered the behavior of consumers may turn out to be a more permanent shift. A recent article in the Wall Street Journal reported that the global cosmetics market is down 8%, with less people venturing out of their homes. Demand for at-home cooking products such as Hellman’s Mayonnaise, Knorr soup cubes, and frozen dinners are on the rise. Consumers are ordering more online, embracing food-delivery services, and buying cleaning and hygiene products in droves.  And this is just the tip of the iceberg.  Here are three ways the pandemic has shifted consumers’ mindsets and purchasing behavior, with the data to prove it. 1) Live entertainment in the age of coronavirus The live entertainment industry has experienced significant disruption since Covid-19 began spreading globally in January. The NBA suspended its season in early March. The International Olympic Committee postponed this summer’s Olympic Games in Tokyo until next year. Concert venues have been shuttered as many countries have limited social gatherings to 50, 10, or even 2 people. What does the future hold for live entertainment? Data suggests that consumers’ fear of Covid-19 might keep them from returning to arenas, concert halls, and other venues even after the industry kicks back into gear. A recent global survey by Dynata, the world’s largest first-party survey platform, found that over half of people expressed significant concern about returning to live events.  “Our findings suggest a mood of caution as people think about a return to live experiences,” state the researchers at Dynata. “Sixty-five percent overall say they will return to live concerts quite slowly or not at all; 55% say the same for movies, 57% for sporting events and 64% for live theater.” The team at Dynata also found that, since the pandemic started, more than half of those surveyed have live-streamed a concert, movie, sports event, or theatrical production, with movies being the most popular choice of entertainment. Live-streaming events is most common in China, where close to 70% of Chinese people have live-streamed at least one movie since the pandemic began. Dynata, 2020 Consumers aren’t nearly as shy about returning to restaurants. A recent survey by the Cincinnati-based experiential marketing firm AGAR found that consumers were more likely to indicate a desire to return to restaurants than sporting events, concerts, and cultural holidays and fairs. Moreover, consumers are voicing a growing interest in health-conscious event planning. Asking consumers what event features they would most desire in the future, the team at AGAR found that hand sanitizing kiosks, social distancing ground stickers, and spaced-apart seating were on the top of the list. Interestingly, over a third of people expressed a willingness to pay a premium to attend smaller events with limited capacities. “The results of the study clearly show us the path forward, what must be done to bring people back and to make them comfortable,” said AGAR founder, Josh Heuser. “It’s vital that we ensure people feel supported, safe and cared for while attending events.” 2) Contactless payment is becoming the rule not the exception Covid-19 may have finally given contactless payment the nudge it needs to become the go-to mode of payment. The team at AGAR found that consumers view contactless payment as a necessary feature at live events moving forward.  Prior to the pandemic, approximately 22% of the more than 11,000 global respondents surveyed by Dynata expressed a preference for cash. This has now fallen to 15%. The countries most prepared to make the shift to contactless payment are China, Singapore, and the United Kingdom.  “The past few months have seen an increase in the availability of contactless methods,” according to researchers at Dynata. “The biggest growth has been seen in the USA, moving from 38% to 46% ownership of a contactless method of payment.” 3) Adjusting to telemedicine According to the researchers at Dynata, 84% of people using telemedicine services during the pandemic were doing so for the first time. And the data show that it is here to stay; 55% of people using telemedicine found the experience to be extremely or very satisfactory. Interestingly, people in the United Kingdom, United States, and Canada were most satisfied with the experience, perhaps because there is a relatively low number of doctors per capita in these countries. Beyond telemedicine, consumers are increasingly interested in products that provide protection against environmental contaminants and pathogens. Wesley LaPorte, co-founder and CEO of PhoneSoap, a company that makes UV light phone sanitizers, notes a significant uptick (+500%) in PhoneSoap web traffic.  “As awareness of the spread of COVID-19 began to grow in the country, PhoneSoap quickly sold out of UV-C light sanitizers,” said LaPorte. “After the spike in March, web traffic is still significantly higher than last year, with consumers continuing to place pre-orders at unprecedented levels.” Conclusion: Sigmund Freud was famous for popularizing the idea that human behavior is largely guided by sex, attraction, and the pleasure principle. Covid-19 provides a compelling counterpoint to Freud’s theory — that, especially during times of heightened panic and threat, it is the survival instinct that trumps all other motivations. Full coverage and live updates on the CoronavirusWe may benefit from sharing data, but we don’t want to lose control of it. We may benefit by ... [+] collaborating, but we want to protect our interests. Pioneers are turning to blockchains to advance our capability to simultaneously share and protect. In our jet age, a virus doesn’t heed borders. The high stakes, worldwide pressure test we are in demonstrated that while we are clearly interconnected, we have much work to do to effectively collaborate. In a matter of weeks, we saw basic structures we depend on—hospitals, education, supply chains, even the concept of an office—suddenly falter. One after another, Covid-19 exposed fragility long hidden behind the normalcy of day-to-day operations. Business as usual stalled the world over and our response demands a new level of agile collaboration—this time across organizations, ecosystems, and even industries. Naturally, we turn to our digital tools for support. Yet, it’s becoming starkly clear that despite 30 years of the web under our belts, there are still gaps—that the way we want to use the internet still doesn’t quite match up with the functionality it offers. We want to share data across organizational or regional borders, but we don’t want to lose control over that data. We want to collaborate, but we want to protect our interests and our IP.  Many in the technology community see answers in an emerging technology, blockchains. Blockchains offer features that could advance our capability to simultaneously share and protect. Here are seven projects demonstrating how pioneers are leveraging this technology to support safer collaboration in the fight against Covid-19.  Safely Collaborate With Health Data Blockchain platform Hacera’s MiPasa project is using the technology to create a safe, protected hub of verified pandemic data from credible sources to drive new insights.  Technologists, data scientists and public health officials can apply analytics against multiple data sets—far more data than available in a single organization.   Around the world, governments and corporations have struggled with the tension between individual privacy and public health as contact tracing apps become a vital tool to restart the economy—and these apps have also suffered low usage. The Stanford Medicine Healthcare Innovation Lab and Prysm Group are developing a solution to both preserve privacy and experiment with incentives for use. A European consortium has piloted a tamper-proof immunity passport for Covid-19. The consortium, which includes Guardtime, Swiss security firm SICPA, and French health data platform OpenHealth will use the technology to issue and manage certificates based on antibody test results. The data is timestamped and used via an app and QR codes. Safely Share Intellectual Property In the journal Science this month, a team of researchers described how blockchains could be used to protect diverse teams of researchers around the globe working together on a cure for a pandemic. Researchers may be hesitant to share findings that have not yet been formally published because there hasn’t been a way to protect patents, interests of employers, and prove attribution. They are looking to blockchain technology to enable a auditable trail, prevent tampering, and selectively grant access to data only to trusted collaborators.  Retired USAF Colonel James Allen Regenor founded Rapid Medical Parts this March to protect the veracity and track the use of designs for 3-D printed parts using a blockchain-based platform. The company was awarded a contract by the Pentagon to support the conversion of sleep apnea machines (which are in ample supply) into ventilators, ensuring that designs and printing instructions have not been subjected to tampering.  Boost Supply Chain Resilience Rapid Supplier Connect is a new blockchain project that supports health-care providers in identifying nontraditional but vetted suppliers of medical equipment that they can trust, as companies from across industries mobilize to provide medical supplies. Hospitals can search for supplies on the platform, but vendor financial information and certification is only revealed once the supplier agrees to share it—supporting trusted connections while retaining control of how data is used. Covid-19 has revealed what pressure on global supply chains that lack connectivity and data exchange can look like. The World Economic Forum (WEF) has identified blockchains as instrumental to develop supply chain resilience by helping to build more transparent, interconnected, and interoperable networks. Last month, WEF released a toolkit supporting the work of using blockchains in supply chains. In Time For Our Current Crisis? While many of these projects mobilized around the current crisis, it’s a long road ahead to achieve impact at scale—and this may not come in time for the Covid-19 pandemic. Unfortunately, this won’t be the last time we need global-scale agility in response to a pandemic or other black swan event. As blockchain technology is more broadly adopted and integrated, its functionality offers the promise to strengthen our ability to carry forward, next time. Full coverage and live updates on the CoronavirusFarmers Insurance, GM Financial, And Tryg use AI text analytics from Clarabridge and Verint as well ... [+] as chatbots from IBM Watson, Boost.ai, and LivePerson. Companies that invested heavily in their digital customer outreach were able to evolve and tailor those communications to meet the new demands and challenges presented by the Covid-19 pandemic. Businesses, such as insurance companies Farmers Insurance and Tryg, as well as GM Financial, the financing arm of the carmaker, turned to chatbots and AI technologies to help maintain their customer bases. Those innovations will only increase in importance in the coming months,  representatives of these companies said, as businesses reopen and customers adapt to the new ways of doing business in a post-pandemic world. As the number of calls skyrocketed in March, GM Financial’s AI chatbot “Nanci” answered 60% of customer interactions, while Tryg’s chatbot “MIA” handled about 80%. Chatbots use AI-based algorithms to comprehend and respond to text or voice questions from customers.  Farmers Insurance, GM Financial and Tryg also employed text analytics software to listen and learn from their customer interactions. Since these companies were early adopters before the crisis, they could respond daily to the evolving needs of customers amid the Covid-19 outbreak, such as fielding queries about delaying payments and other relief measures. How businesses handle customer conversations, otherwise known as “customer experience,” will be a crucial  concern as companies head back to the office in the upcoming months. GM Financial "Our 700 employees started working from their homes within a week of the shutdown orders," said Bob Beatty, the executive vice president and chief experience officer at GM Financial.  "We trained everyone on LivePerson and deployed a virtual desktop phone to everyone in the first week of remote working." Bob Beatty, the executive vice president, and chief experience officer at GM Financial, uses IBM ... [+] Watson, LivePerson, and Clarabridge to support customers. According to Beatty, his team digitized every step of customer interaction. They chose LivePerson for their person-to-person chat platform, IBM Watson for their conversational chatbots and Clarabridge for text analytics. Early into the pandemic, communications using live chat between agents and customers rose from 10% to 60% of total call volume.    Their AI chatbot Nanci handled 50% to 60% of all the inbound requests without a human.   Built using IBM Watson, "Nanci runs 24x7, and gets updated every night by our analytics team," said Beatty. “Analyzing the thousands of customer conversations from chat and phone calls play a key role in knowing what our customers are thinking,” said Michael Beste, vice president of analytics for GM Financial.  “Clarabridge extracts the topics and emotional tone from the thousands of daily customer interactions.”   Beste’s analytics team then uses the output to update Nanci on how to respond. “As the pandemic increased in the U.S., customers worried about the ability to pay from our conversations with them,” said Beatty.  “GM financial responded by offering different payment solutions to fit each customer's need, and empowered the client service representative with the ability to offer a solution immediately to a customer.”  Farmers Insurance  It’s the business of Farmers Insurance to be prepared for the unexpected. “In March, Farmers Insurance transitioned 19,000 employees from the office to working from home remotely in the matter of a few days,” said Melissa Joye, chief customer experience officer for Farmers Insurance. Melissa Joye, chief customer experience officer for Farmers Insurance uses AI text analytics to say ... [+] on top of what their customers are saying. Prior to the pandemic, Farmers invested in the digital customer outreach software that their network of insurance professionals use to speak to customers.  The company uses a variety of software apps to provide a real-time pulse on what customers are saying and what needs attention.  A case in point, Farmers isolated COVID-related customer feedback in the Covid dashboard using Clarabridge, a text analytics company. "We recognized early on in the pandemic that many customers would face financial challenges during this time, and we extended payment grace periods," said Joye. "As we evaluated mileage data we could see driving was decreasing and what that would mean for accident frequency."    The company responded by reducing car insurance premiums by 25% for April for customers with Farmers and 21st Century branded policies.   Farmers made other like minded business policy changes to help their customers during the crisis. "Our ability to listen to customers across channels, analyze data in real-time and empathetic customer experience professionals are helping us maintain positive customer experience momentum during the pandemic," said Joye. Clarabridge Turned On Covid Command Centers  Covid Command Center dashboards showing the conversation topics, sentiment, and emotions expressed ... [+] by customers During the rise of the pandemic, companies used products like Clarabridge and Verint to analyze chat, phone, and email conversation for companies using a form of artificial intelligence called natural language processing. “The conversation topics started around the stay at home orders, then quickly moved to topics on the stimulus and financial worry after the first two weeks,” said Mark Bishof, CEO at Clarabridge. Mark Bishof, CEO at Clarabridge, said that their Covid Command Center dashboards helped over 100 ... [+] companies turn customer conversations into response during the pandemic.  Bishof noted that Clarabridge created a special dashboard for their customers during the crisis called “Covid Command Center.”   He noted that over 100 customers use these dashboards to track how what their customers were saying  and how they were feeling. Emotional models highlighted how people were feeling in the pandemic such as anger or frustration. The sentiment model showed daily whether the conversations were negative, neutral, or positive.  Sentiment is a measure over time — an hour, day, weeks, or months — to let companies see how certain topics or customers are trending. Tryg Insurance  Tryg's "MIA" chatbot powered by Boost.ai handled 80% of the customer traffic in Norway.  "Our digital customer platform delivered better than expected during the COVID-19 pandemic," said Benjamin Alex, business efficiency lead at Tryg. "During the first two months of the pandemic period our customer calls increased by 50% with our AI chatbot MIA handling about 80% of the conversations.”  Alex added that manually handling a spike in volume of this magnitude would typically require us to activate an additional 10-15 resources. Benjamin Alex, business efficiency lead at Tryg A/S uses Boost.ai for AI chatbots, Verint for speech ... [+] analytics, and UIPath automation. Trgy  is the largest non-life insurance company in Denmark, Norway, and Sweden with 4 million customers processing 1 million claims annually.   According to Alex, customer interactions are handled mostly by phone in Denmark, and by phone and chat in Norway and Sweden. "We have many tools to handle different tasks, such as Verint for Speech Analytics, Boost.ai for AI chatbots, and UIPath for RPA (Robotic Process Automation)," said Alex. "We have established a Center of Excellence for each of those tools where we identify and adapt the right tool according to the needs of both the business and our customers." Prior to the crisis, Tryg handled 60% of all inbound claims are handled through the self-service features of the platform and 45% of all claims are submitted online.  Alex added that 30% of all claims are processed without human involvement. Henry Vaage Iverson, chief commercial officer, and co-founder at Boost.ai have chatbots live in a ... [+] network of 200 finance, insurance, and retail companies in the US and Europe. The company behind MIA, Boost.ai, saw similar jumps in traffic across their network of 200 companies in the US and Europe.   “We saw spikes in conversations, as high as 300% increases, related to the pandemic not only in the insurance sector, but also in other areas such as banking, healthcare, and the public sector, “said Henry Vaage Iverson, chief commercial officer at Boost.ai. Customer Conversations Become A Priority "Last October, the Forrester Customer Experience, or CX, index predicted that 25% of CX professionals would lose their jobs for not showing value of customer experience to their companies," said Faith Adams, a senior analyst serving customer experience professionals at Forrester Research. “It is the white elephant that many organizations did not want to touch.”  Faith Adams, a senior analyst at Forrester, thinks how companies listen to their customers will be a ... [+] bigger priority in the post-pandemic recovery period. Forrester’s CX Index measures how successfully a company delivers customer experiences that create and sustain loyalty. With the rise of the pandemic, Adams started getting phone calls from panicked customer experience leaders.   “They wanted to know what they should do, continue business as usual or make changes on how they engaged their customers,” said Adams. “To survey or not to survey was often the question.”   Adams explains that while customers’ surveys are ineffective, analyzing real-time conversations captures more insights.  She added that the voice of the customer technologies show trending conversation topics as well as the sentiment and emotional tone of the customer.   Clarabridge's Covid Command Centers uncovered some important topics during the pandemic, such as ... [+] "stay at home", "stimulus", and "delinquency fears" among others. "We observed that companies with technology capabilities that could capture the real voice of their customers could better understand their needs, and how to respond," said Adams.  She noted that some Forrester customers are utilizing customer feedback loops, like Clarabridge and Verint in hopes of emerging from the pandemic in a stronger position. Customer feedback loops analyze all of the content of customer conversations on a daily basis pointing out main topics being said, then assigning an emotional tone, such as happy or sad, and sentiment, such as positive, negative or neutral.

The city government is distributing food to the poor who are unable to get out and work due to the lockdown. (AP Photo/Fernando Vergara) Whether to wear a mask or not for coronavirus protection is widely debated these days. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) updated its guidelines in April calling for the use of cloth face masks in public settings (such as grocery stores and pharmacies) where social distancing measures are difficult to maintain.  But what about wearing a face mask inside your own home?  Before you dismiss the suggestion, consider this new research published in BMJ Global Health that says wearing masks at home is 79% effective at preventing spread among family members.  The key part: to be effective, home mask usage must happen before any symptoms emerge.  Researchers came to their conclusion after questioning 460 people from 124 families in Beijing, China about their household hygiene and behaviors during the pandemic. They found that most of the person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2, which causes the Covid-19 infection, occurred in families.  Each family in the study had at least one confirmed case of Covid-19 between late February and late March. Family size ranged from 2 to 9 people and usually comprised three generations.  Researchers wanted to find out what factors would increase or lessen the risk of other family members catching the virus during the incubation period—14 days from the start of the first person’s symptoms.  During this time, secondary transmission occurred in 41 out of the 124 families with 77 adults and children falling ill. Symptoms in the children were typically mild. In the adults, 83% had mild symptoms, while 1 in 10 suffered severe symptoms. One person became critically ill.  The study says wearing face masks at home before symptoms emerged, including the first person to have symptoms, was 79% effective in reducing transmission. It also credits frequent use of bleach or disinfectants for household cleaning, which was listed as 77% effective.  Study authors say their findings back universal face mask use in public spaces and also at home, and say the advice is most relevant for families living with someone in quarantine or in enforced social isolation, and for families of healthcare workers who may face ongoing risk of infection. Full coverage and live updates on the CoronavirusThe Veterans Administration has all but stopped using hydroxychloroquine as a coronavirus treatment, even as the White House continues to praise the controversial drug despite no evidence of its effectiveness and one study that showed it may actually be dangerous. Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie speaks during a hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington, ... [+] Thursday, May 28, 2020, on the Department of Veterans Affairs response to COVID-19. Secretary Robert Wilkie told Congress on Thursday that hydroxychloroquine treatments at VA hospitals have “ratcheted down as we’ve brought more treatments online.” The agency only used the drug to treat three patients last week, compared to 404 patients at the end of March, and expects that trend to continue. Wilkie defended the VA’s early use of hydroxychloroquine when few other treatment options were available at the time, saying it gave patients “hope,” the Associated Press reported. Though there were some promising early studies, there is no clinical evidence the drug is effective: A retrospective study at the VA released in April found hydroxychloroquine showed no benefits while a paper in the medical journal The Lancet linked hydroxychloroquine to an increased risk of death and heart problems compared with those who were not taking the drug. Others have turned against hydroxychloroquine in recent days following the release of the Lancet paper: France, Italy and Belgium banned its use for Covid-19 patients outside clinical trials and the World Health Organization paused a large study this week over safety concerns. Medical providers are allowed to treat patients with hydroxychloroquine while it is being studied further because the Food and Drug Administration issued an emergency use authorization for the drug, though the NIH recommends against using a combination of hydroxychloroquine and antibiotic azithromycin. Trump has touted the drug for months after promising early studies were widely covered on Fox News and hyped in right-wing circles. He even said he was taking hydroxychloroquine himself to prevent infection with Covid-19, but has since stopped. Still, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany told reporters Thursday that Trump would take the drug again if he thought he was exposed to the disease, according to the Washington Post. Another treatment, remdesivir, made by biopharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences, has shown positive results in early clinical trials, earning a bit of optimism from Dr. Anthony Fauci. “The data shows that remdesivir has a clear-cut, significant, positive effect in diminishing the time to recovery,” he said. Full coverage and live updates on the CoronavirusCoronavirus has swept through a Tyson pork processing plant in Storm Lake, Iowa, with 555 employees of 2,517 testing positive, fueling renewed concerns over safety measures at meatpacking plants. Packages of Tyson Foods Inc. Fully Cooked prepared foods are arranged for a photograph in ... [+] Washington, D.C., U.S., on Monday, Nov. 19, 2012. Tyson Foods, the largest U.S. meat processor, said profit will increase about 10 percent in fiscal 2014 and 2015 after remaining unchanged in the year ahead as the company adds more prepared foods and international sales. Photographer: Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg On Wednesday, with suspicions the plant was the site of a new outbreak, Iowa's Department of Public Health Deputy Director Sarah Reisetter said the state would only confirm outbreaks at businesses where 10% of employees test positive and only if the news media inquires about them specifically. According to the Des Moines Register, cases in Buena Vista County more than doubled on Tuesday, and Reisetter is now confirming around 22% of the employees at the Storm Lake facility tested positive. "We've determined confirming outbreaks at businesses is only necessary when the employment setting constitutes a high-risk environment for the potential of Covid-19 transmission," Reisetter added. On April 28, President Trump signed an executive order using the authority of the Defense Production Act to compel meat processing plants to remain open, but it hasn't stopped facilities from shuttering to address low staffing and safety issues. Tyson was previously forced to shut down its largest pork processing facility, located in Waterloo, Iowa, on April 22 following a number of coronavirus cases stemming from the plant, as well as worker absenteeism. Other meatpacking facilities across the state have also been forced to address outbreaks, including plants owned by Smithfield Foods and JBS. State lawmakers and mayors in Iowa have complained about not getting information about the ongoing situations at meatpacking facilities until it's too late. Sioux City Mayor Bob Scott said because Tyson isn't based in the state, they don't need to report numbers to them. Iowa Rep. Ras Smith criticized Governor Kim Reynolds and the Department of Health's stance on the delays in reporting numbers. Food processing facilities have been the site of numerous outbreaks around the country, with Trump pushing for them to remain open amid fears of food shortages. Earlier in May, the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, the largest meatpacking workers union, derided Trump's executive order, saying that since its signing, "The administration has failed to take the urgent action needed to enact clear and enforceable safety standards at these meatpacking plants.” There are 18,524 confirmed cases of the coronavirus in Iowa.  Full coverage and live updates on the CoronavirusAfter over two months of unprecedented shutdowns due to the coronavirus pandemic, Las Vegas casinos have been given a green light to reopen on June 4, a move that could result in a major rebound for their beaten-down stocks. Shares of big casinos have rallied amid optimism about reopening.  Casino operators have had a rough 2020 amid widespread business shutdowns caused by the coronavirus pandemic: Major operators like Wynn Resorts, Las Vegas Sands and MGM Resorts have seen their share prices plunge by 25% or more so far this year. According to investment researcher Morningstar, while the coronavirus pandemic continues to “materially affect near-term travel and leisure demand,” all three major casino stocks are trading at significant discounts to fair value: Wynn (22% discount), MGM (43%) and Las Vegas Sands (18%). As states begin to lift lockdowns and allow some businesses to reopen, casino stocks have recovered somewhat on the possibility of a faster than expected economic recovery. On Tuesday, Nevada Governor Steve Sisolak gave the state’s casinos the green light to reopen starting June 4; Las Vegas Sands rose 6.5%, Wynn 8.5% and MGM 11% on the news. Caesars Entertainment, Las Vegas Sands, Boyd Gaming Corp., MGM and Wynn Resorts say they will open that day. It won't be business as usual however, with social distancing guidelines and other protective measures such as plexiglass barriers in effect; Casinos will also be operating at 50% capacity, meaning the industry won't be returning to normal levels of business just yet. With Vegas slated to reopen next week, casinos could be high-risk areas for the spread of coronavirus, former Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb told CNBC on Thursday. “You look at Las Vegas reopening its casinos… Those are the kinds of settings where I think you have more risk, where you have a lot of people crowding together,” he warned. Amid shutdowns caused by coronavirus, Nevada’s unemployment rate surged to 28.2%—the highest in the entire country—last month, according to recent data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Unemployment surged, up from 6.9% in March, as the state was hard-hit by casino closures and a standstill in the tourism industry. At the request of Gov. Sisolak, Nevada’s Gaming Control Board published requirements for a “phased and incremental resumption of gaming operations.” Those health and safety guidelines say casinos will be responsible for limiting occupancy to 50%, making masks available and checking the temperature of guests. It also requires staff to follow disinfection and social distancing protocols.

Trump's executive order could lead to attempts to punish companies such as Twitter and Google for attempting to point out factual inconsistencies in social media posts by politicians. (Photo by Doug Mills-Pool/Getty Images) Trump’s executive order intends to limit a federal regulation known as Section 230, which gives companies like Facebook and Twitter immunity against being sued over the content that appears on their sites from users.  Trump’s intended changes to Section 230 would mean social media companies "that engage in censoring or political misconduct," would no longer have the same protections; Trump also said the order directs the Federal Trade Commission—an independent agency—to stop social media from "engaging in any deceptive acts or practices affecting commerce." When announcing the executive order in the Oval Office, he claimed that Twitter had "unchecked power to censor" and that Twitter was like an "editor with a viewpoint." Trump also said he'd want to "shut it down" in regards to Twitter, though he doesn't have the authority to do so and he acknowledged that "I'd have to ask the lawyers."  The order has been rumored to be in the works since 2019 but rose back to the forefront this week after Twitter fact-checked an inaccurate tweet from Trump about mailed ballots in California. Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany during Thursday's White House briefing refused to acknowledge that a tweet sent by President Trump was at all inaccurate and further wouldn't admit that Trump has ever lied in the past. Trump's asserted that "anyone living in the state" was sent a ballot, but only registered voters received them, and his continued claim that mail-in voting is "fraudulent" is counter to research that reports very few instances of misconduct. FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel said on Thursday "An Executive Order that would turn the FCC into the President's speech police is not the answer. It's time for those in Washington to speak up for the First Amendment. History won't be kind to silence." Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) meanwhile acknowledged issues of misinformation on platforms like Facebook and said Mark Zuckerberg "panders" to Trump, but called the president's reaction to Twitter's fact-check "silly" and "a distraction" from the Covid-19 coronavirus pandemic. "Let's get back to saving lives okay?" Trump's shifted his focus toward social media regulation and away from the pandemic and the crisis in Minneapolis around the death of 46-year-old George Floyd while being arrested by four police officers. Soon after Trump's executive order signing, the FBI is holding a press conference regarding the Floyd killing. The U.S. leads all countries in confirmed cases of the coronavirus and reported deaths with 1,712,816 and 101,129 respectively. The more than 20-year-old Section 230 is considered the "26 words that created the Internet," according to Jeff Kossett, a cybersecurity law professor at the U.S. Naval Academy. 18,000. That's how many false statements Trump has made since entering office until April 3, as estimated by the Washington Post. Trump also said he wouldn't simply delete his Twitter account because of "fake news," though he has a tendency of sharing inaccurate information. Full coverage and live updates on the CoronavirusThe Chinese government told its citizens this week to stockpile masks and other protective gear in case of future outbreaks and emergencies, drawing a sharp contrast to countries including the United States that have warned citizens not to stockpile masks as the healthcare system continues to face shortages, prompting confusion among individuals who hope to be prepared for the future. Disposable masks Families in China should store masks and personal protective equipment (PPE) as part of home first-aid kits, said Ning Jizhe, vice-chairman of China’s top economic planning agency, according to the South China Morning Post.  The U.S. Surgeon General Jerome M. Adams infamously told Americans at the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak not to buy masks: “Seriously people—STOP BUYING MASKS!” Like the U.S., China had a mask shortage at the height of its coronavirus outbreak, sparking criticism of the country’s emergency resource reserves.  As a result, the government is building a three-prong emergency resource reserve plan, reliant on business, family and governmental stockpiles to prevent and control future epidemics, said the agency’s deputy secretary general on Sunday via South China Morning Post.  The agency also hopes this announcement will stimulate domestic consumer spending, as retail sales are down and China is the biggest mask manufacturer in the world. American officials have not advised Americans to store masks; Dr. Adnan Hyder, a dean at George Washington University’s Public School of Health told Forbes, “The hoarding of any medical PPE is inappropriate” in the United States, citing serious shortages for essential and healthcare workers who require medical-grade PPE.  “China has more than 400 million households. Everyone must get into the habit of having reserves and rescuing themselves,” said Jizhe.  In the early days of the coronavirus pandemic, Americans were advised not to stockpile masks as frontline workers experienced shortages; now, as masks are mandatory in many public places while medical-grade PPE remains in short supply for essential workers, the conversation has moved to what type of masks are appropriate and effective for everyday Americans—with experts, including Hyder, advising people to select homemade masks with filters. The issues with the American PPE economy reverberates globally. “The international market for desperately needed medical masks is riddled with fraud,” reports the Washington Post on the matter, saying that on May 18, healthcare professionals treating Covid-19 patients were still forced to ration and recycle masks. Government and healthcare officials like whistleblower Rick Bright say the shortage of masks is the doing of the federal government. And there’s a bizarre New York Times

On Tuesday restaurants, bars and even beaches in most of mainland France will be allowed to reopen, Prime Minister Edouard Philippe announced Thursday. Reopened establishments must enforce social distancing measures, including keeping three feet of space between tables, limiting tables to groups of 10 and having staff wear face masks. A notable exception is the Ile de France region that contains Paris, the country’s most populous and most impacted by the virus, where bars, restaurants and cafes will also only be permitted to serve patrons on their famous outdoor terraces and patios. France marked seven straight days of less than 100 reported daily Covid-19 deaths on Wednesday, with a total of 183,000 cases since the pandemic began. France follows countries like Italy, Spain, Greece, Germany and the Czech Republic in allowing some of their eateries to reopen gradually with safety measures in place. In the U.K., the hardest-hit country in the region, Prime Minister Boris Johnson hinted Thursday that Brits may be able to go back to their beloved pubs by July. Europe, once home to some of the world’s worst Covid-19 outbreaks, is beginning to see the light at the end of the tunnel as more countries experience drops in new cases and deaths from the virus. Despite the overall downward slope, small clusters of new viral outbreaks have been reported, including a dozen people who tested positive for Covid-19 in Germany after visiting a newly-reopened restaurant in Leer, a town in the north.

The Dow fell for the first time in three days. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.6%, around 150 points, on Thursday, while the S&P 500 was down 0.2% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.5%. Stocks cut their gains late in the day, with the Dow shedding more than 200 points, after President Trump announced he would be giving a news conference regarding China on Friday.  Trump’s administration is widely expected to ramp up pressure on China in response to a newly passed national security bill for Hong Kong, which effectively rendered the region no longer politically autonomous from China. The Labor Department reported on Thursday, that another 2.1 million Americans filed for unemployment benefits in the week ending May 23, bringing the ten-week total to more than 40 million job losses.  The latest unemployment data signaled that the worst of the economic damage from coronavirus may be over, however, as the pace of new filings has dropped significantly and continuing claims plunged by nearly 4 million. The U.S. economy contracted 5% in the first quarter, more than the 4.8% expected, the Commerce Department reported on Thursday. But many market experts are still hopeful on a recovery: Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan told CNBC that the U.S. economy is already starting to “come out of the hole.” Twitter shares slid over 4% on Thursday, as President Trump plans to sign an executive order targeting social media platforms. The move comes after Twitter for the first time fact-checked some of Trump’s tweets, prompting outrage from the president. “It’s still an extremely large number, but if the number of people continuing to file for unemployment benefits is decreasing then this should be viewed as a positive for the economy as more people are going back to work as states begin the re-opening process,” says Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance. “We can take some solace in the fact that claims are moving in the right direction,” according to Bespoke Investment Group. This week's reading was the 8th straight week-over-week decline, the firm points out, which is the longest streak of such declines on record (going back to 1962). The market has so far made robust gains this week, thanks to increasing optimism on Wall Street over a successful reopening of the economy and a potential coronavirus vaccine. Stocks broke back above two crucial milestones on Thursday that show the market’s recovery from the coronavirus downturn in late March. The Dow closed above 25,000 and the S&P closed above 3,000, both for the first time since March. Rising U.S.-China tensions may keep gains in check: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo confirmed to Congress on Wednesday that Hong Kong is no longer “politically autonomous” from China. Not only does that threaten U.S.-China trade, it could also result in new sanctions on Chinese officials on Friday, when Trump gives his news conference. As investors grow increasingly optimistic about an economic reopening, they’ve started to rotate out of stocks that benefit from stay-at-home orders, including companies like Zoom and Shopify. Stocks that would directly benefit from the economy reopening again have jumped in recent days, including cruise lines, casino operators, airlines, banks and some retailers.

The chair of the House Workforce Protections Subcommittee and other Democrats complained at a subcommittee hearing today that the agency has issued only one enforcement action (a citation for a rule making violation), after receiving 5,000 Covid-19 complaints.  “It has failed to develop the necessary tools it needs to combat this pandemic and it has failed to fully use the tools it has; instead focusing principally on issuing press releases and voluntary guidance,” asserted Workforce Chair Alma Adams of North Carolina. Workforce Protections Ranking Republican Bradley Byrne of Alabama countered by claiming Adams and her colleagues were engaging in partisan legislative games. Byrne, once a private attorney hired by companies to aid them in dealing with OSHA regulations, praised OSHA’s Covid-19 guidance as “extremely important” in helping employers protect their employees. While OSHA has no specific Covid-19 enforcement standards, the Republican Congressman said employers have requirements under general duty provisions. Adams dismissed the general duty obligations as “toothless.” The two also sparred over a Democratic proposal for OSHA to issue an Emergency Temporary Standard for Covid-19 which was included in the May 15 House-passed Heroes Act. Bryne contended there is too little known about the ailment for OSHA to create a temporary standard. He noted it usually takes the agency seven years to come up with a workplace regulation. Connecticut Democratic Representative Joe Courtney pointed out OSHA came up with blood borne disease standards for health care facilities quickly in the wake of the AIDS epidemic in the ‘80s and ‘90s. “It wasn’t a five to 20-year process,” said Courtney.  OSHA Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary Loren Sweatt told the Subcommittee she is proud of the agency’s response to Covid-19. “The priority been removing the worker from the hazard or the hazard,” said the OSHA executive. She added there have been 1,364 Covid-19 whistleblower complaints filed with OSHA as of May 26. Sweatt said there have been no sanctions against companies for retaliation, but worker whistleblowers have been reinstated into their jobs and have received back pay. She noted OSHA’s parent, the Department of Labor, is under a Trump Administration requirement to eliminate one existing rule for every new rule created. Testifying alongside of her, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health Director Dr. John Howard was asked if there are workers who should not wear masks on the job. He said people with pre-existing respiratory conditions are best to go without masks to help their breathing. “They should tell their employers about it,” the NIOSH leader said.  On the same day of the hearing OSHA also issued new guidance on how employers can protect employees from Covid-19 in offices and other joint workplaces. The recommendations include:    Full coverage and live updates on the CoronavirusGetty Though online banking continues to gain in popularity, there are times when it may be necessary or preferable to visit your bank’s branch in person.  With the threat of COVID-19 shutting down businesses across the country, banking has not been immune. Numerous banks and credit unions, from some of the nation’s largest financial institutions to smaller community banks, in March began shifting to drive-through-only services for customers. Now, with all 50 states in various stages of reopening, you may be wondering what branch banking will look like going forward. Even if you only rarely visit your bank’s branches—preferring instead to do your banking online, by phone or at ATMs—it’s helpful to know what you can expect as the coronavirus crisis moves through its next phases in the U.S. Banks and credit unions are considered part of the “essential business” category, meaning that, despite shutdown orders, they were not required to close. But many financial institutions took the initiative to put measures in place to protect both customers and staff from coronavirus community spread. Those measures have included:   Some banks have taken the additional step of closing branches permanently. According to data from S&P Global Intelligence, 157 bank and thrift branches were closed in April 2020, while only 17 branches opened. Closing branches can be a cost-cutting measure for banks and credit unions, allowing them to streamline overhead expenses.  On the other hand, some banks are moving ahead with expansion plans to open new branches. That’s encouraging if you’re worried about branch banking disappearing altogether as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak. And at least one survey shows that consumers still want branch banking access.  In a poll conducted by Boston Consulting Group, just 3% of Americans said they would stop using branch banking altogether in response to the coronavirus pandemic. By comparison, globally, 24% of banking customers said they would be less likely to visit a branch. With demand for branch banking continuing, banks and credit unions will have to rethink how they handle in-person visits from customers.  How banks and credit unions decide to handle reopening can vary from one financial institution to the next. The American Bankers Association has created a reopening matrix to help guide banks in their decision-making. The matrix offers guidance on things like:   These are guidelines, however, not hard-and-fast rules, and the ABA reminds banks that they should consult the laws in their state for guidance regarding things like social distancing and the wearing of masks.  But, looking ahead, it’s possible that branch banking could feature any of the following, once states begin to fully reopen:   The measures that you’ll see in banks may be similar to the ones retail stores and restaurants are introducing to keep both staff and customers safe. Banks and credit unions face an interesting challenge in trying to balance the needs of customers to do their banking in person while protecting the health of everyone involved.  Since banks are considered essential businesses and were able to use their own discretion in closing, the same is true for deciding when to reopen branches. In other words, it’s up to individual banks to decide when to move ahead with opening and how to do it. That decision may be influenced by state guidelines for reopening. For example, in some states such as North Carolina, Phase One of reopening looked much the same as it did for businesses when stay-at-home orders first took effect. This meant continuing to limit customer access to branches and allowing people inside on an appointment-only basis. Many banks have attempted to make managing accounts easier for customers during this time to help ease the side effects of not being able to visit a branch. Some of the measures banks have taken include:   The Federal Reserve also has announced an interim final rule to suspend the Regulation D limit on savings account withdrawals. Ordinarily, you’d be limited to making six withdrawals from a savings or money market account per month. But to make it easier for people to tap into savings, this restriction has been lifted by the federal government. However, it’s worth noting that banks can still choose to impose a fee for exceeding the monthly limit.  The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered financial worries for many Americans. For example, you may be wondering how to budget your money if your only income is unemployment insurance. Or you may be wary of coronavirus scams that could target your online banking activity. So it’s natural to wonder whether your money is still safe when you can’t get to your bank’s nearest branch. The good news is, your accounts are protected if you do business with an FDIC-insured bank. Regardless of what your bank’s operating plans look like during the coronavirus crisis, your deposits are still protected up to the FDIC limit of $250,000 per depositor, per insured bank, for each account ownership category.  That coverage still applies if for some reason your bank ends up closing permanently because of COVID-19’s financial impact. In the event of a bank closing or failure, the FDIC can step in and take control of the bank and its customer accounts. When that happens, your account can either be transferred to another bank or the FDIC will send you a check for the amount of your covered deposits.  If you’re not sure what’s covered and what’s not, the FDIC offers a helpful tool for determining your coverage. And if you keep your money at a credit union instead of a bank, you should be covered by National Credit Union Association insurance. The NCUA extends the same type of coverage to credit union accounts as the FDIC does for bank accounts.  With bank branch reopenings still a question mark, it’s helpful to know what your options are for managing your checking, savings and other accounts in the meantime.  Banking by phone is one option, and it’s a service most banks offer. With phone banking, you’re typically able to check balances, pay bills and schedule transfers between accounts. That’s similar to what you can do with your accounts at the ATM. Using the ATM to manage your accounts can be useful if you need to withdraw or deposit cash or to deposit checks. Online and mobile banking may be the most convenient way to manage your bank accounts during COVID-19 or any other situation where getting to a branch isn’t possible. With online and mobile banking, you can do things like:   You can’t deposit cash using online and mobile banking; you’ll still need to visit a branch or an ATM for that. But otherwise, online and mobile banking can cut down on the need to visit a branch as often. All of these features can make banking convenient and easy, easing some of the financial stress you may be feeling as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak. If you haven’t signed up for online and/or mobile banking yet, your bank may be able to help you with that over the phone. Banks typically offer online and mobile banking free of charge to their customers. When using online and mobile banking, remember to review things like ACH or wire transfer limits, direct deposit limits and mobile check deposit limits to see how much you can add to or withdraw from your account daily, weekly or monthly. While there are still occasions when you’ll need or want the services of a brick-and-mortar bank location—whether for handling cash, getting advice or accessing a safe deposit box—the past months of the COVID-19 crisis have shown U.S. consumers just how effective mobile and online banking services can be in meeting a variety of customer needs. Full coverage and live updates on the CoronavirusWhile most of the restaurant industry reels from the economic impact of coronavirus, pizza chains are thriving and sending their stocks higher thanks to a surge in online orders and steady demand during the pandemic. Companies like Domino’s and Papa John’s have seen sales skyrocket in recent months.  Domino’s and Papa John’s recently provided impressive mid-quarter business updates as stay-at-home orders during the pandemic forced customers to turn to online orders and delivery options more regularly. Domino’s and Papa John’s, which trade for $366 per share and $77 per share, respectively, have been soaring in recent weeks; Domino’s stock is up 26% in 2020, while Papa John’s is up 23%.  Papa John’s said on Wednesday that same-store sales shot up 33.5% in North America and 7% globally since last month—the second straight month of the “best sales period in the company’s history.” Similarly, at Domino’s Pizza, U.S. sales have “accelerated materially” in recent months, jumping 14% since late March and 21% in the last month alone. Longbow Research says it’s confident both companies will continue to see the benefits of the delivery and take-out model through the current environment and beyond; the firm has a “buy” rating on both stocks with a price target of $441 per share for Domino’s and $95 per share for Papa John’s.  MKM Partners says that both companies “are doing the right things operationally” and are “well positioned both strategically and financially” to weather the current crisis.  But MKM has concerns about the companies’ recent valuations and has assigned a neutral rating to both stocks; It has a $350 per share price target for Domino’s and a $72 per share price target for Papa John’s.  Even as Domino’s and Papa John’s outperform in a challenging environment, Pizza Hut continues to struggle. Yum! Brands, the parent company of Pizza Hut which also owns brands like Taco Bell and KFC, has seen its stock fall over 12% so far this year. The stock has rebounded to some degree over the past few months, jumping 32% in April and May. According to Yum! Brands’ first quarter earnings, Pizza Hut’s same-store sales plunged 11% during that period. Pizza Hut’s interim U.S. president Kevin Hochman is confident that the chain can make a recovery, telling Yahoo! Finance in an interview earlier this week that “we want to get back to being America’s favorite pizza… we made tremendous progress even over the last ten weeks.” The coronavirus has accelerated a shift toward digital sales for many restaurants with much of those gains “likely to be maintained longer-term,” according to UBS analyst, Dennis Geiger. The firm expects digital and mobile growth, “which was already an increased focus for larger chains,” to continue well beyond the pandemic. It remains to be seen whether booming pizza sales will continue as more of the country reopens. “Some of these gains in May should subside in June because dining rooms are reopening and people are starting to venture out a little more,” says Bloomberg Intelligence restaurant analyst Michael Halen. At some point, as quarantine orders are lifted, sales will inevitably decline to normal levels, he adds. A second surge of coronavirus in the fall or winter, however, “would obviously be a boon for sales again.” Dow Closes Above 25,000 For First Time Since March (Forbes) Dow Surges 500 Points As Investors Bet On A Coronavirus Vaccine Breakthrough (Forbes) Here Are 13 Stocks That Both Hedge Funds And Mutual Funds Are Buying Up (Forbes) Buy These Stay-At-Home Stocks For The Coronavirus Economy, Market Experts Say (Forbes) Full coverage and live updates on the Coronavirus294 healthcare workers have died from Covid-19 after fighting it on the frontlines, according to CDC data, which the National Nurses Union says is a consequence of PPE shortages.  NEW YORK, NEW YORK - MAY 26: Medical workers wearing protective masks stand outside NYU Langone ... [+] Health hospital as people applaud to show their gratitude to medical staff and essential workers during the coronavirus pandemic. 62,690 healthcare workers have contracted coronavirus, resulting in 294 casualties, according to new CDC data.  There are likely more healthcare worker casualties, as only 21% of cases reported to the CDC include information that could identify the patient as a healthcare worker. National Nurses United, the country’s largest nurse union, calculated a healthcare worker death count using publicly available information like obituaries and found 530 fatalities. These figures come after months of reported PPE shortages at healthcare facilities around the country: “Nurses and other healthcare workers continue to find themselves abandoned at COVID-19’s front lines, without PPE,” said National Nurses United. “Despite nurses’ demands, President Trump has made no effort to mass produce N95 respirators using the Defense Production Act.”  87% of 23,000 nurses surveyed by the NNU reported having to reuse single-use equipment when treating Covid-19 patients and 72% said they had exposed skin or clothing when treating Covid-19 patients.  412: That’s how many first responders died combating the  9/11 attacks. This means that Covid-19 first responder deaths approach that of the most fatal terrorist attack in American history.  "Our members showed up and many of them made the ultimate sacrifice," Pat Kane, executive director of the New York State Nurses Association, told NPR. "And many of them got sick. That was round one. We should be better informed by our experience."  This comes in conjunction with Wednesday’s grim 100,000 deaths by coronavirus milestone. Meanwhile, the PPE shortage remains far short of the 3.5 billion masks U.S. officials have long presumed that the country would need in a pandemic of this nature. On May 22, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization to give healthcare workers greater access to PPE in response to shortages that includes shoe coverings, surgical helmets and gowns. “There is no adequate, approved, and available alternative to the emergency use of these gowns and other apparel,” said the FDA in the authorization.  COVID-19 Has Killed Close To 300 U.S. Health Care Workers, New Data From CDC Shows (NPR) New survey of nurses provides frontline proof of widespread employer, government disregard for nurse and patient safety, mainly through lack of optimal PPE (National Nurses United) Almost $800 Million In Mask Scams Alleged In The U.S. Alone (Forbes) Coronavirus Has Now Killed 100,000 Americans (Forbes) 15 Heroic Firsthand Stories From The Coronavirus Frontlines (Forbes) Full coverage and live updates on the CoronavirusA researcher works in the laboratory of the Amsterdam UMC, in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, on May 28, ...

(Photo by Koen Van WEEL / ANP / AFP) / Netherlands OUT (Photo by KOEN VAN WEEL/ANP/AFP via Getty Images) One of the questions I’m asked most frequently is when we will have a Covid-19 vaccine. To that I say, the question is not when, but if. If we don’t have a vaccine, we don’t yet know how safe and effective it will be. Given our well-documented difficulty developing coronavirus vaccines for SARS and MERS, and now the less than promising data from recent studies involving humans and nonhuman primates, we can’t be so sure that the current race to produce a Covid-19 vaccine will end in certain success. We don’t know whether the vaccine will offer sterilizing, long lasting immunity—as hoped—or only transient, partial protection, as seems more likely. What we do know is that public acceptance of a Covid-19 vaccine will play an outsized role in our ability to get as many people vaccinated as possible—and to that end, it isn’t too early to begin planning our efforts to educate the public. As a new analysis published in JAMA makes clear, early planning and public education is a must. To proactively confront barriers to Covid-19 vaccine acceptance in the United States, its authors argue, we must ramp up public health education now. The authors begin with the premise that anything short of broad acceptance of vaccination risks failure. They write, "Given that certain individuals will be ineligible for Covid-19 vaccination due to age, immunocompromise, and other preexisting medical conditions, a vaccine refusal rate greater than 10% could significantly impede attainment of this goal.” The goal in question is that of population immunity, generally referred to by the unfortunate name of “herd immunity.” Why is such a high acceptance rate needed? A major consideration is that a Covid-19 vaccine, like most vaccines, is likely to be ineffective for older adults. As we age, the immune system loses its ability to respond to vaccines for new diseases. This is a problem, since in this case it is the elderly who are most vulnerable to Covid-19—and most in need of protection. To help limit exposure of the elderly to Covid-19, a vaccine must limit the total number of infected people in the population from whom they may contract the virus. I believe that most people aren’t aware that the most vulnerable population is least likely to benefit directly from a Covid-19 vaccine, no matter how effective it may be. Their health and safety depend on low infection rates in the general population. The authors identified points of resistance to vaccine acceptance. These include: Questioning the necessity for a vaccine. Questioning the safety of a vaccine. Vaccination as a matter of freedom of choice. A general suspicion of the health care system. The authors did not mention the anti-vaccine movement explicitly, but its shadow looms large. Combined, these barriers have the power to prevent efforts to control the epidemic through any vaccine that may be developed, no matter how safe and effective it is. Consider also the projection of these issues onto the world stage. Availability and acceptance of the vaccine globally is as important as it is locally. Recall that the infection of one person many thousands of miles from our shores has infected more than 1.7 million Americans—and the count is still rising. Full coverage and live updates on the CoronavirusNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said in a Thursday press conference that he will sign an executive order allowing businesses to deny service to customers who are not wearing masks, contrasting with businesses across the country that have said the exact opposite and will not serve customers who are wearing the protective gear.  Sporting a bracelet that says "NY Tough," New York Governor Andrew Cuomo speaks during a news ... [+] conference Wednesday.  Speaking from Brooklyn, New York, Cuomo said that the state’s focus has shifted to safely reopening New York City, which is close to meeting benchmarks for phase one. “You don’t want to wear a mask, fine. Then you don’t have a right to enter that store,” said Cuomo, who stressed that the protective gear is what will enable the state’s economy to continue reopening and start down the road to recovery. The executive order follows reports that businesses in Kentucky, Texas, California and Wisconsin will not allow customers through their doors if they wear masks, the latest development in the culture war sparked around the face coverings. Other political leaders, including New Jersey Mayor Phil Murphy and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, have previously issued similar orders. Health officials and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention agree that people should wear face masks to help control the spread of coronavirus, which in a grim milestone has killed over 100,000 Americans as of Wednesday. "When you see hipsters and yuppies walking around without a mask I say, what is it? Is it arrogance?" asked comedian Rosie Perez, who joined Cuomo along with fellow comedian Chris Rock to discuss the coronavirus’ disproportionate impact on minority communities.  Cuomo has mentioned mask wearing as a sign of respect in multiple press conferences. He ramped up his support for wearing the protective gear over previous weeks, having once told reporters, “It couldn’t hurt. It's not exactly fashion forward.” Cuomo arrives at press conferences and other engagements, like his Wednesday meeting with President Trump at the White House, wearing a face covering. “Mask shaming,” or the ridiculing of people not wearing the protective gear, has exploded online among people fearful of Covid-19. Political divisiveness has transposed to the wearing of masks, with Republican officials less likely to mandate them, and Republican voters also less likely to wear them. Masks have even sparked violent conflicts, including a Michigan security guard who was killed after telling a customer to wear a mask. In recent days, however, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), and Fox News host Sean Hannity have advocated for wearing masks. Mask or no mask? Face coverings become tool in partisan combat.

The first week of May was National Wildflower Week, which was meant to be a cue to buy native flowering plants at your local nursery. It was probably closed for browsing, but it’s not too late in many parts of the country to buy seeds or order plants for pickup. And as a matter of promoting good tax policy and sound reasoning among your fellow taxpayers, you should add that to your weekend to-do list. Plants that are indigenous to your location trounce turf grass and ornamental exotics in ecological benefits, and wherever you are, there are many interesting choices that aren’t hard to care for and that attract beneficial insects and wildlife. The only thing holding most suburban and urban dwellers back from literally making their little piece of the world a better place is an understanding that plants have a function in the landscape beyond mere decoration. Another deficit is the reason we are increasingly likely to end up with a carbon tax soon. Both the impending ecological disaster and the tax policy one are preventable. Dissuading people from ecologically and socially harmful, if generally accepted, practices is ostensibly the goal of a carbon tax. Carbon taxes have been kicked around in the United States for some time, but without a pressing economic problem, the idea has never taken off. One of the fundamental problems is that a carbon tax, merely a subspecies of a consumption tax, is inherently regressive. Taxpayers with smaller incomes would end up paying a greater percentage of their income in carbon taxes than wealthier taxpayers. Solving the regressive nature of a carbon tax is largely possible, but would involve administrative complexity. The political calculus of carbon taxation has suddenly shifted significantly. Douglas Holtz-Eakin of the American Action Forum recently said he views a deficit-reducing carbon tax as the only viable extra revenue source. The White House considered a carbon tax back in 2017, but it was primarily trying to find a way to pay for a reduction in the corporate income tax rate. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act reduced the corporate rate without implementing a tax on greenhouse gases, and that seemed to be the end of the road for a carbon tax for a while. It’s back on the table now because of the economic damage caused by the coronavirus pandemic. The fundamental problem with a carbon tax is essentially the same: It raises revenue, but at the cost of increasing consumer prices, while not necessarily stemming pollution substantially. The regressivity of a carbon tax, even one that includes a partial rebate, is a big problem given the particularly harsh economic impact of the coronavirus on taxpayers with smaller incomes. Carbon tax discussions rarely seem to mention that a better approach would be to convince Americans of the benefits of environmentally friendly choices, rather than to tax greenhouse gas emissions. The ecological damage of modern life is real, and it’s a problem for humans now and in the future, but tax isn’t an ideal solution. The best strategy is to appeal to reason and self-interest to persuade people to stop polluting, not to inure them to a little extra pain at the cash register. So go buy native flowers and find them a suitable spot in the garden. You’ll make the native pollinator population much happier (turf grass is useless to bees and butterflies); you’ll improve the aesthetics of your neighborhood (no one honestly believes that turf grass is either interesting or beautiful); and you’ll reduce the need for a carbon tax (or at least help forestall further discussion until the next recession).

[+] menstruation The Covid-19 crisis has touched almost every aspect of life. From adapting to working from home, fearing for job security, not being able to see loved ones and negotiating getting groceries safely, a lot has changed over the last few months. However, charities and experts have highlighted that Covid-19 is exacerbating pre-existing inequalities and issues. May 28 marked Menstrual Hygiene Day and research has highlighted that period poverty and stigma are getting worse during the Covid-19 pandemic. Period poverty was already a major issue globally. However, due to financial strain, reduced access to products and an increase in the price of products people are suffering more.  Period poverty is defined as a lack of access to sanitary products, menstrual hygiene education, toilets, handwashing facilities, and, or, waste management. It’s still an issue that affects people that have a period around the world. Research from development and humanitarian organization Plan International has found that the Covid-19 pandemic is leaving people struggling to manage their periods. They surveyed health professionals in 30 countries and 73% said restricted access to products through shortages or disrupted supply chains is a major issue.  68% pointed to restricted access to facilities to change, clean and dispose of period products during the crisis has being a fundamental problem and over half (58%) said an increase in the price of products is exacerbating period poverty during the lockdown. Rose Caldwell, chief executive of Plan International UK said in a statement, “the virus is making the situation worse. We already know that the coronavirus outbreak is having a devastating impact on family finances all over the world, but now we see that girls and women are also facing widespread shortages and price hikes on period products, with the result that many are being forced to make do with whatever they can find to manage their period. This can pose a real threat to their health and may increase the risk of infection.” According to the IMF’s World Economic Outlook projections and data from World Bank’s PovcalNet, “Covid-19 is likely to cause the first increase in global poverty since 1998.” It’s predicted it’ll push 49 million people into extreme poverty in 2020. This financial pressure and threat of poverty is exacerbating the pre-existing issue of period poverty. Health professionals told Plan International that a lack of access to information and services and reduced access to clean water to manage periods are two key issues during the lockdown.  “The financial impacts of Covid-19 has put additional stress on a population already in need, making this year’s Menstrual Hygiene Day especially important,” says Dr. Jessica Shepherd, OB/GYN and U by Kotex partner, “during this time of need, there are many more women who have possibly been affected by period poverty or who were already lacking prior to Covid-19 and need all the support they can get.”  Charities, food and hygiene banks and in some cases, hospitals have picked up the effort to ensure period products are more widely available during the lockdown. However, period poverty was already a major problem before the pandemic. “Food banks and refugee and homeless shelters in some areas are continuing to struggle to provide sanitary products and the financial fallout from Covid-19 could see more people pushed into period poverty,” says Intimina’s gynecologist Dr. Shree Datta, “in some cases, charities have reported requests from medical staff, who have been unable to obtain products due to their busy schedules and the initial stockpiling seen. Lockdown has also made it more difficult to get sanitary products to those who need them the most.”  Plan International has warned that due to decreased access to products and information, the economic pressure of the Covid-19 lockdown and a less hygienic environment to dispose of products period poverty is getting worse under lockdown. Worryingly, the charity also noted that there’s been a rise in stigma and shameful or harmful cultural practices. The economic pressure of the crisis is exacerbating existing inequalities. Full coverage and live updates on the CoronavirusSigns promote drive-thru coronavirus (COVID-19) testing at CVS Pharmacy on May 15, 2020 in Carver, ... [+] Massachusetts. Nine CVS locations began providing coronavirus tests in Massachusetts, issuing self swab tests to people by appointment. (Photo by Maddie Meyer/Getty Images) CVS Health Thursday said it is delivering as promised to open 1,000 testing locations for the Coronavirus strain Covid-19.  The scale of the openings comes more than two months after CVS, Walgreens Boots Alliance, Rite Aid, Walmart and other retailers pledged in White House meetings to use their thousands of locations, including parking lots to expand U.S. testing for COVID-19. In CVS Health’s case, the sites that will all be open Friday will use “self-swab tests” as part of a newer phase of testing by the giant drugstore chain. “It’s no small feat to operationalize 1,000 test sites in weeks under trying circumstances, which is a credit to our employees and their unwavering commitment to being part of the solution,” CVS Health president and chief executive Larry Merlo said. “Our testing strategy will continue to evolve and make the most effective use of our resources as we work to help safely re-open the economy.” CVS is hoping to dramatically ramp up testing by processing up to 1.5 million tests every month. Currently, CVS processes about 30,000 tests for COVID-19 a week in five states as part of a rollout that began several weeks ago with a focus on front-line healthcare workers and first responders. “Since first offering COVID-19 testing at a pilot site outside a CVS Pharmacy in Shrewsbury, Mass., in mid-March, the company has performed nearly 200,000 tests nationwide,” the company said in a statement released Thursday. CVS Health’s announcement should be welcome news for the Trump administration, which announced the participation of the retailers in March and has been vowing to provide access to COVID-19 testing to all Americans, but has been dogged by criticism. Patients can register at CVS’ web site to get tested. Full coverage and live updates on the CoronavirusGetty Not every employee who’s been working from home feels anxiety about returning to the office. There are more than a few who see the chance to work in an office as a welcome respite from being trapped in the house with kids, spouses and more.  But many employees are anxious about returning to the office. And if bosses don’t assess and address those anxieties, the resulting discomfort could show up in absenteeism, decreased productivity and even OSHA complaints. How can a leader accurately assess their employees’ particular anxieties? By asking, preferably in a one-on-one conversation. I’m going to show you a series of questions that every leader should ask each employee individually. You can put these questions into a survey and they’ll work okay. But while a survey can suffice, it’s nowhere near as powerful as asking these questions in a one-on-one conversation. When you engage directly with an individual employee, not only do you get valuable data that’s more nuanced and detailed than any survey, but you also demonstrate caring and empathy. And especially these days, demonstrating empathy will earn you a lot of loyalty from your employees. Question #1: How do you feel about coming back to the office? The purpose of this question is first to gauge your employee’s overall anxiety (or excitement) about coming back into the office. But the secondary purpose of the question is to demonstrate that you really do care about how they’re feeling. You may well be able to pull out a policy binder and tell employees that “fear of contracting Covid-19 is generally not a legal reason to refuse coming to work.” However, you’re much better off if you can evidence some empathy and surface any concerns long before you get to the point of having to quote corporate policies.  Question #2: What concerns you about coming back to the office? The first question set the stage for you to now identify any particular concerns your employees might have about returning to the office. They might worry about social distancing or safety procedures in the company cafeteria. They could also be worried about a lack of safe child-care, family health concerns or even about taking public busses to get to the office. The point is that your employees’ concerns will vary wildly from person to person. If you don’t ask, you won’t discover their particular stressors. And that means you won’t be able to help solve them. Question #3: If needed, how effectively could you maintain your work from home situation for the next six months? One of the key strategies in developing a back-to-the-office plan is identifying how to phase-in your employees. Simply having all employees rush back to the office is a recipe for trouble (imagine the social distancing problems with a crowd of employees all entering your lobby simultaneously).  Knowing that you’ve got employees who can both perform their jobs remotely and handle the emotional rigors gives you lots of flexibility to create a phased plan. Not every employee can take another six months of working remotely. But if you’ve got a group of employees who can, you don’t have to make them rush back to the office, and you can methodically test and refine your plan. Question #4: What are your biggest challenges working from home? For any employees who are going to continue working from home, you want to make that experience as pleasant and productive as possible. And that means assessing and addressing any impediments they’re currently experiencing while working remotely. There’s another reason for asking this question; it’s within the realm of possibility that there’s a second wave of the pandemic that requires a quick return to working remotely. If that were to happen, you certainly don’t want it to feel as chaotic as it did a few months ago. By assessing and addressing any remote-working challenges now, you’re essentially developing a contingency plan for future crises. How To Respond To Your Employees The most important lesson for leaders when your employees start answering your questions is to be empathic. Unfortunately, across the thousands of people who’ve taken the free online test “Do You Know How To Listen With Empathy?” about a third of respondents failed pretty badly. And only about 20% of people achieved perfect scores. So empathy is easier said than done. But here’s one trick that will help you out. Researchers at UCLA conducted a study in which subjects were asked to write an essay describing a time a boss had treated them unfairly. Believing that another person was reading their essay (it was really just the researchers), one group of subjects was told that the reader said, “I tried to take their perspective, but I just couldn’t put myself in their shoes.” The other group was told the reader said, “I tried to take their perspective, and I could really put myself in their shoes.” When people heard that the reader could really put themselves in their shoes, they liked that person 19% more. And they felt 78% more empathy towards them. So as a starting point, memorize the phrase “I can really put myself in your shoes” and use it liberally. And then, of course, take the empathic listening test and make sure that every leader in your company can pass it. You undoubtedly have some employees feeling anxious about returning to the office. Ignoring those fears won’t dissipate them. But if you can empathically assess and address their concerns, you’ll not only have less fearful and more productive employees, you’ll earn lots of goodwill as well.

Full coverage and live updates on the CoronavirusGetty The coronavirus is making your people stressed. The 24/7 news cycle delivers the latest developments in the pandemic, the stock market rollercoaster and a slew of other scary realities. According to the nonprofit mental health and wellness website HelpGuide.org, “Stress is your body’s way of responding to any kind of demand or threat. When you sense danger—whether it’s real or imagined—the body’s defenses kick into high gear in a rapid, automatic process known as the ‘stress response.’” Your workplace team is dealing with a lot of stressful situations and questions: How do we handle having our kids out of school? How can I best care for my ailing parents? Should I leave home to go to the grocery store? How do I work from home without the comfortable work environment I’m used to? All this impacts their well-being and their performance at work. Ironically, when your company takes action to help keep your people safe and happy, this may also be contributing to the team’s stress level because a lot of what you’re doing falls under the category of change. People who used to go to the office and worked alongside their colleagues are now having to get used to working from home. Policies to prevent exposing your people to potential threats, like eliminating travel and canceling all in-person meetings, may keep them safer physically but can disrupt their sense of stability. To help your people achieve a level of calm within the chaos, here's what to provide: Control. One of the most challenging parts of this crisis is feeling out of control. To reduce this, make all aspects of work feel clear and controllable. That means over communicating with your people so they have the answers they need. Make it clear and easy for them where to find the information and support they need—that includes access to mental health support through EAP programs and access to others who can help them. Training. Competent professionals who are not used to working remotely need to learn best practices for being productive and happy at work without being in the office. Rather than making them fend for themselves, give them proven tips for remote work. This is where L&D executives can take the lead to provide clear, practical training on how to be successful and happy as a WFH employee. Provide videos, checklists and other guidance that will help them make their WFH experiment a success. Consistency. Establishing routines is essential, especially for those who are now working from home and have left their normal procedures behind in their cubicle. It’s least stressful when your people can mirror those routines that were part of their workday. If you had an all-hands meeting every Monday at 9 a.m., keep it up, changing only the fact that it will take place via video instead of in the conference room. Ask this question: What can be easily replicated? Stress-Reduction Resources. While going to the gym might normally be a stress reducer, that’s not an option in the new age of physical distancing. Identify other resources that can help your people amp up their zen. The CalmCast stress reduction app, for example, can be customized to augment the app’s stress-reducing resources with your company’s messages for your staff. Identify resources that your staff can access anytime, anywhere. Camaraderie. One of the biggest changes that happens when your people leave the office behind because of WFH policies is that they lose the sense of belonging and connection. Encourage your people to check in on each other. Have them schedule regular Zoom or Skype calls, especially if they have strong friendships at work. We know from Gallup research that having a best friend at work is one of the best predictors of employee engagement.  An Ear. Make sure your people feel heard. Ask them what they need and how the organization can help them be more successful. Get answers to their most stress-inducing questions and make those answers visible. Create a list of the top things they’re concerned about and address them. They need to know that someone is in charge and has their back. Easy Technology. Although a lot of the responsibility for creating a stress-free work-from-home environment is on them, there are things you can do to reduce the friction. That means having the technology, platforms and training (if necessary) in place to ease the transition. Firewalls and other security safeguards can get in the way of access and add to the stress. IT leaders can step up here by finding ways to maintain company data security while making it straightforward for employees to access the systems and data they need to effectively do their work.  When you’re dealing with tumultuous events like the coronavirus pandemic, stress is unavoidable and enduring. When you thoughtfully plan and put systems, tools, processes, resources and support in place specifically designed to mitigate stress, your people will be more engaged and productive, and all of you will be significantly less frazzled.

Full coverage and live updates on the CoronavirusSajith Wickramasekara started biotech R&D software company Benchling in his MIT dorm room. Now it's ... [+] worth $850 million.  Sajith Wickramasekara started working on an idea for a cloud-based Crispr design tool for scientists during college at MIT eight years ago. Today, researchers at Regeneron, Gilead and other biotech giants rely on Benchling’s R&D software to help them track, measure and forecast their scientific work. With biotech in the spotlight as researchers search for vaccines and cures for Covid-19, Wickramasekara told Forbes that he scored a new investment of $50 million from investors led by Alkeon Capital this spring that brings Benchling’s total funding to $114 million at a valuation of $850 million.  “I don’t think the world has ever been so focused on biotech R&D before,” says Wickramasekara, a Forbes Under 30 alumnus who is now 29. “We have a very ambitious roadmap to help accelerate the next generation of breakthroughs.” Back when he was an undergrad building the company in his dorm room, he simply wanted to address the difficulties he’d seen scientists and researchers face in the lab. He’d studied computer science and spent time in a biology lab, and was frustrated with how the reliance on paper, email and spreadsheets was holding back research. “You spend so much time [dealing with] missing data and doing the same thing that’s been done before,” he says. He and his cofounder, Ashu Singhal, also a student at MIT, started out by giving their software away for free to academic researchers. Singhal, who graduated with a bachelor’s degree in computer science in 2011, now works on the product side for Benchling.  In those early days, it wasn't clear what the company’s value might be, and there was a lot of skepticism about software focused on just one vertical. John Cumbers, who runs synthetic biology hub SynBioBeta, recalls rejecting Wickramasekara (who is on leave of absence from MIT) from an incubator back then. “I just thought there’s no market for it, that nobody was going to pay for software for biology,” he says. Today, the San Francisco-based company is one of 25 that made the cut for this year’s Forbes’ Next Billion-Dollar Startups list. Benchling uses a freemium model that relies on academic researchers to bring their desire for its software with them as they start companies or finish their Ph.D.s and get hired at existing biotechs. Today, nearly 350 companies pay for Benchling at a cost that can range from $15,000 a year for a small biotech startup to millions for a large corporation. Its revenue reached an estimated $21 million in 2019. And as the company has grown, it’s added new products, including a new data and analytics dashboard that helps its customers gain both scientific and operational insights.  The increasing complexity of biotech research has also helped spur Benchling’s growth. “As you shift to manipulating living cells, the data you work with is more complex,” Wickramasekara says.”Defaulting to paper and spreadsheets wasn’t an option for them anymore.” Brandon Reeves, a principal at Lux Capital, who led the firm’s recent investment in Benchling, says he kept hearing about Benchling from executives at the healthcare and life sciences company in its portfolio. “We invest in so much biotech that spends money on Benchling,” he says. “It’s become a line item for them, like how Salesforce 
  
  CRM 
  is a line item for enterprise IT.”  Since Covid-19, Wickramasekara figures that its software is being used on research for more than a dozen potential treatments or vaccines. In addition, in an effort to help ramp up testing for Covid-19, he has offered Benchling for free to any lab that wants to test patients for the disease. More than a dozen have signed on. Corteva Agrisciences, the agricultural company spun out of DowDuPont last year, is among those that rolled out a testing effort in April. “We had to go from not having a laboratory at all to having a lab,” says Doane Chilcoat, who leads the Covid-19 testing project for Corteva. Corteva started using Benchling on April 10, 2020, and began testing patient samples from its healthcare partners at MercyOne on April 27, 2020. So far, he says, Corteva is doing a few hundred tests a day, but given the Covid-19 testing demands, it could crank that number up to thousands, helped by Benchling’s software. “We are not a clinical company, but we do more nucleic-acid testing than almost anybody else on earth,” he says. While Wickramasekara says that Benchling didn’t need the funds as it hadn’t yet spent the $35 million it raised last summer, he wanted to be sure the company would have financial stability and not have to worry about any future economic uncertainty. “Life sciences R&D is really hard. Many drugs fail,” he says. “Our customers need us to be stable. Having a balance sheet like this is reassuring to them.” With the new funding, Wickramasekara figures on expanding the company’s product portfolio, to add more tools for researchers working with chemistry as well as biology (with a first product release expected this year). He also plans to increase its international operations, especially in Europe, where it had plans for a Zurich office before he pandemic. “In the long run,” he says, “the investment in biotech is going to go up. This will increase the need for collaborative software.” In addition to Alkeon and Lux Capital, investors in the new funding include Benchmark, Iconiq, Menlo Ventures, Spark Capital and Thrive Capital. Full coverage and live updates on the CoronavirusAntarctic Peninsula. Some of the most fascinating data in the Covid-19 pandemic have been produced by small, naturalistic experiments—from “sealed” environments (cruise ships) to subgroups of the population who had routine testing way before it was widely available (women checking into hospitals to give birth). These studies have shown lower death rates than previously thought and a relatively high rate of asymptomatic carriers.  The latest is another unwitting study, taking place on a small ship headed to the Antarctic Peninsula just as the pandemic was unfolding. Among the 217 passengers and crew were the three people who ended up writing the paper—clinician researchers from Australia, including lead author Alvin J. Ing of the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences at Macquarie University.  Here’s the short version of how the debacle unfolded (for a short podcast with Dr. Ing, see here). An avid photographer, Dr. Ing joined the expedition departing Argentina in mid-March, which was to retrace Ernest Shackleton’s 1915 voyage. As the WHO declared a global pandemic days before the departure, all passengers and crew were thoroughly checked for fever and overall health, and to make sure no one had traveled through high-risk countries recently. There was hand sanitizer and hand washing stations, but no social distancing procedures were implemented, making the ship a virtual breeding ground for a respiratory virus.  Everything was great for the first eight days, but on the eighth day, one person came down with a fever, at which point everyone quarantined in their rooms, and full measures to stop any further spread were implemented. Another 9 passengers or crew became symptomatic in the following 3-4 days. Since Argentina had shut down borders, the ship sailed to Uruguay, where it docked—by day 13, most of the fevers had improved. Rapid antibody testing was done on individuals who’d had fevers earlier, and all were negative (keep reading).  On day 14, three more people developed mild symptoms; of these, one was taken to a hospital for intubation on day 17. Seven others were evacuated to hospitals as well. One of these, the authors point out, was a 68-year old man who “developed fever on day 23 (15 days after cabin isolation) and was evacuated for hypoxaemia on day 24.” All evacuated patients tested positive with the gold standard 2019-nCoV RT-PCR test. But here’s the really interesting part. On day 20, the Uruguayan health ministry provided all remaining passengers and crew with CDC’s 2019-nCoV Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel.     Though it’s not totally clear how and whether the numbers may be applied to the general population, the small study seems to have some interesting takeaways. First, it confirms what others have suggested—that Covid-19 antibody tests probably don’t work well during acute infection. It also suggests that effective quarantine is difficult, and hardly foolproof even with physicians around. And of course, the asymptomatic rate is intriguing, and on par with other studies—it suggests that not only are there are considerable number of Covid-positive people without symptoms, but it may even be a majority.

One traditional part of medicine involves patient rounds, in which a medical team enters a patient’s room to evaluate progress after admission to the hospital.  However, as a result of the high transmissibility of Covid-19, even this traditional practice is now in the process of evolution. Finding innovative approaches to minimize time and need for direct patient contact with patients requiring PPE would be ideal.  To address these ongoing challenges posed by Covid-19, doctors at Imperial College London are now using mixed-reality (augmented reality or AR) headsets to help reduce the number of persons necessary at the bedside, while at the same time enhancing communication, and ultimately reducing usage of PPE by healthcare providers.  The augmented reality headset used by the doctors is Microsoft’s Hololens 2. It allows the doctor—fitted with PPE and the headset—to enter the patient’s room and communicate and broadcast the patient encounter real-time, obviating the need for a large group of physicians to be at the bedside. The unique feature of the technology employs overlay of holographic images of specific anatomy (via CT, MRI or x-ray images) or sharing of data such as lab results in the person’s screen while wearing the headset.  “At Imperial College London we have been using the Hololens to holographic telemedicine platform in our Covid-19 response since March,” said Dr. James Kinross, Consultant Surgeon and Clinical Senior Lecturer in Colorectal Surgery, Imperial College London who is leading the initiative. “This was started as part of our www.pansurg.org response to the pandemic.” “It was an attempt to innovate in response to two principal problems—the first was a high rate of staff illness due to Covid-19 and the second was accessing PPE and training all staff in its proper use,” he emphasized.  Kinross explained that “The Hololens 2 system uses a software called Remote Assist 365 which permits bedside multidisciplinary team communication. We deployed this for hands-free, ‘heads up’ distributed video telemedicine in Covid-19 environments. This was because we could simply send one doctor into a Covid-19 environment instead of 4 or 5 that would typically be present on a ward round.” Kinross explained that there were some operational issues to allow Hololens 2 to be “securely networked into the hospital on the NHS wireless network.” adding that “the next challenge was to ensure we could use the system safely with PPE and that staff would not come to harm.”  One this was achieved, he explained that their team was “able to rapidly innovate during the worst phase of the Covid-19 escalation in London and deploy by the beginning of April.”  But the real payoff would be whether such as system would be able to change hospital protocol for conducting patient rounds. The hope was that such an approach would ultimately help to reduce the number of doctors and time spent at the bedside, reducing demand for PPE at the bedside.  “We prospectively studied its impact and found on average a saving of 50 hours of Covid-19 contact time per clinical team using the Hololens 2,” said Kinross. “We had four teams deployed with the system in the trust. We also found significant improvements in the efficiency of the ward rounds and in the reduction of PPE consumption,” he added.  The results were quite impressive: “On some of the busiest wards there was a saving of 700 PPE items per week per ward,”said Kinross. “Our most junior staff reported significant improvements in communication over our sickest patients and were also able to adapt the system so that we could visualize electronic healthcare records and relevant imaging at the bedside and authorizations reported this was extremely effective.” Kinross is continuing to expand its applications and is exploring its utility in the operating room for surgery involving the GI tract, expressing his enthusiasm for the device.  “We're now looking into other areas,’ he explained, “where we can use HoloLens because it is improving healthcare without removing the human; you still have a doctor next to your bed, treating you. Patients like it, too. They are interested in this new piece of technology that’s helping them.”  “More importantly we are deploying this as an educational platform for teaching our medical students who cannot currently enter the hospital, The goal is establish a formal trial to establish its true clinical utility,” he offered.

However, the court ruled that the state cannot prevent clerks from approving applications, saying it is confident local officials will comply with the ruling “in good faith.” The Texas Supreme Court is made up of all Republicans. Read the full ruling here. “We agree with the State that a voter’s lack of immunity to COVID-19, without more, is not a ‘disability’ as defined by the Election Code. But the State acknowledges that election officials have no responsibility to question or investigate a ballot application that is valid on its face,” the opinion reads. Steve Vladeck, a law professor at the University of Texas School of Law, noted the hypocrisy of the judges making their ruling remotely because of coronavirus fears. “The Texas Supreme Court has ruled against those who would like to cast mail-in ballots in order to avoid having to go to crowded, public polling places to exercise their right to vote,” he tweeted. “And it did so remotely.” Ari Berman, a senior reporter at Mother Jones covering voting rights, said the measure benefits Republicans because voters 65 and older, who tend to vote conservative, can already qualify for a mail-in ballot without any other reason. A few other states, including California and Michigan, have moved to expand mail-in voting in order to prevent large crowds casting ballots. The actions have drawn the ire of President Donald Trump, who has taken to Twitter to claim erroneously that mail-in voting leads to vote fraud. One such tweet was fact-checked by Twitter, setting off a firestorm wherein the president threatened to regulate social media companies.  A separate federal lawsuit currently before the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals is also pending, but the case could make its way up to the U.S. Supreme Court. Full coverage and live updates on the CoronavirusThe guidelines recommend that classes be held outdoors when weather permits. Los Angeles county released guidelines today for re-opening public schools. The county includes the Los Angeles Unified School District, the nation’s second largest after New York City, which has yet to say when and how it will re-open.   The 45-page framework says students from pre-K through 12th grade should wear masks all day, eat lunch at their desks, and attend on a staggered schedule that makes it possible to limit to 16 the number of students present in class at one time.  The plan was developed by the Los Angeles County Office of Education, which oversees 80 school systems including Pasadena and Long Beach. The LA County office is the nation’s largest regional education agency, responsible for 1.2 million students, including 735,000 in the city of Los Angeles. By comparison, the New York City school system has 1.1 million students.  L.A. County came out with its guidelines before the California state department of education issued its own plan, which is expected in June. There are 6.2 million public school students in the state. “Our main priority is health and safety,” Debra Duardo, the county, superintendent, told the Los Angeles Times. “Unfortunately some of the things that children could enjoy in the past, they’re not going to be able to do that.” Students may get only a single ball to play with, by themselves.   In classrooms that are too small to allow students to be spaced six feet apart, there should only be 12 students present at one time. The guidelines also recommend that classes be held outdoors when weather permits and that large spaces like theaters and auditoriums be used as classrooms. Cafeterias can operate if they’re safely disinfected, but students should pick their meals up and return to their classrooms to eat.  Plans for after-school activities are vague. Special rooms should be designated and schools should partner with community groups like YMCAs and libraries.  The guidelines say nothing about what teachers should do to ensure that five-year-olds remain six feet apart when they’re walking through halls or playing outside. They also recommend that schools install no-touch faucets and soap dispensers. But it’s not clear where schools would get the funds for such improvements. Governor Gavin Newsom has said he wants to protect schools from budget cuts but his latest proposal includes a 10% reduction in school funding.  Last week Los Angeles superintendent of instruction Tony Thurmond said schools could not re-open safely if they have to absorb such deep cuts. Los Angeles county closed schools in mid-March. It moved to virtual instructions but in late March, there were reports that as many as a third of L.A. high schools students were not logging on to classes. About the new county guidelines, one public school parent of a fourth grader and a seventh grader on Los Angeles’s west side said: “They will need more staff which they can’t afford.” School officials are a long way from figuring out how to successfully reopen, said this parent, who didn’t want to be named. “Short of a proven vaccine, the current system can’t handle the reality of life during the time of Covid 19” Full coverage and live updates on the CoronavirusInfluenza (commonly known as the “flu”) is a contagious viral respiratory illness. Every year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provides guidance on what to expect regarding and how to prepare for the upcoming flu season, including details on the available flu vaccinations. What will be different this year however, is how nations will fight against both the flu and the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, the latter of which does not yet have a viable solution. This unprecedented combination will truly challenge healthcare systems and society in the coming months, for multiple reasons. Differentiating The Two Viruses One difficulty during flu season will be to truly differentiate the flu from coronavirus, as both share some similar symptoms. Per the CDC, a few of the many flu symptoms may or may not include “fever, or feeling feverish/chills, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, muscle or body aches, headaches, fatigue (tiredness)...” among other things. Similarly, the CDC states that some symptoms of coronavirus may or may not include “Fever or chills, Cough, Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, Fatigue, Muscle or body aches, Headache, New loss of taste or smell, Sore throat...”etc. Neither of these lists of symptoms are comprehensive by any means, as both viruses may present with a variety of other different symptoms; an infected individual may or may not have some, many, or none of these complaints. However, there is some overlap between the presentations of both infections. Fortunately, rapid flu-testing is available and may help with the detection of the flu virus, though the efficacy is questionable and is dependent on a wide variety of factors. Testing modalities for coronavirus also exist, though significant aspects regarding their accuracy are still being determined.

(Photo by David McNew/Getty Images) Challenges to Healthcare Systems The coronavirus has significantly affected healthcare systems worldwide, creating shortages in both personnel and equipment. As of May 27th, there are more than 5.5 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide, and the United States accounts for nearly 1.6 million of these. While countries are balancing curtailing the spread of the virus with increasing pressure to reopen their borders and economies, the pandemic may continue to expand, especially if a second wave truly emerges in the coming months.  The flu virus causes a significant impact on health systems as well. Per the CDC, the preliminary estimates for the 2018-2019 flu season indicate that an estimated 490,000+ hospitalizations took place, and nearly 34,000+ deaths occurred. Although these numbers likely vary with seasonal discrepancies, they provide a general idea that the flu alone is not something to be ignored, especially when it comes to allocating health resources. Indeed, as both of these are very serious conditions and have relatively significant mortality rates for certain demographics, nations will need to determine how best to augment and prepare their healthcare systems and capacity.

The United States is closing in on 100,000 deaths in less than four months caused by the coronavirus. (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images) In a poll conducted between May 13 and May 18, the majority of Democratic and Independent men and women said they think Trump should don a mask, while 53% of Republican women and 43% of Republican men believe he should. The partisan trends were similarly reflected in whether voters personally wear a mask most of the time in public: a total of 74% said they do, with only Republican men in the minority with 49%. Pressure has grown around Trump over his continued decision not to wear a face mask despite the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommending their use in public and people around him contracting the virus, including a personal valet. Trump on May 21 toured a Michigan Ford facility without a face mask, going against the state's executive order mandating their use, as well as the plant's own policy requiring them to protect workers, causing the state's attorney general Dana Nessel to call him a "petulant child." On Tuesday, Trump attempted to defend his implied criticism of Vice President Joe Biden over wearing a face mask in public by instead asking why Biden doesn't wear a mask while inside his home—and further called a reporter "politically correct" after he refused to remove his face mask to ask a question. Biden shot back during his first in-person interview in over two months, saying “Presidents are supposed to lead, not engage in folly and be falsely masculine.” Some Republican governors, including Mike DeWine of Ohio and Doug Burgum of North Dakota, have urged constituents not to make face masks a political issue, with DeWine writing on Twitter, "Wearing a face covering is not about politics—it's about helping other people." "It's sort of respect for another person and have that other person respect you. You wear a mask, they wear a mask, you protect each other," Fauci said on CNN Wednesday. "I want to make it be a symbol for people to see that that's the kind of thing we should be doing." The nonprofit also found that Trump's handling of the economy was receiving positive reviews from voters with 56% approval. However, his overall job performance remains negative, with 52% of all voters disapproving and 59% of swing voters giving poor marks. The United States crossed a grim milestone on Wednesday as it recorded over 100,000 deaths from the coronavirus, a figure that far-and-away leads the world. The country also has the most confirmed cases of the coronavirus with 1,691,342. Full coverage and live updates on the CoronavirusIn the U.S. alone, officials have charged individuals promising to sell millions of masks without ever delivering, as companies, governments and health officials desperately try to end the national PPE shortage—and scammers see an opportunity to capitalize.  LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA - APRIL 06: Less than 20% of mask buyers and sellers are legitimate, mask ... [+] exporter Alexis Wong told the Washington Post. Law enforcement in the United States has uncovered fraudulent mask schemes totalling $799 million in the last few months by alleged scammers around the country. Officials arrested a New Jersey used car dealer posing as an authorized 3M dealer on Tuesday who allegedly ran a $45 million scheme to sell more than 7 million masks at 400% markup, according to the criminal complaint obtained by the New York Times.  On April 10, a Georgia man was charged with fraud in an attempt to sell 125 million face masks and other forms of PPE, securing orders that would have equaled $750 million; he also promised 3M masks.  Two California-based men were arrested in late April, with prosecutors alleging that the duo was involved in a $4 million conspiracy to sell PPE they did not possess, according to BuzzFeed News.  The SEC has reported a 35% increase in fraud complaints amid the coronavirus pandemic, due to the scale of the crisis and unemployment of whistleblowers who would otherwise be afraid of employer retribution. Less than 20% of mask buyers and sellers are legitimate, estimates Alexis Wong, a Hong-Kong based mask exporter interviewed by the Washington Post who provided the publication with phony bank statements with up to $3 billion in balances from scammers she’s encountered in the PPE business.  New York officials tapped Real Housewife-cum-business mogul-philanthropist Bethenny Frankel, according to the New York Times

 , to obtain 15 million masks first for $82.5 million, then 10 million masks $66.5 million from entrepreneurs who never actually delivered a single mask.  Current and former government officials say that the PPE shortage could’ve been avoided and is the fault of the federal government, according to the Washington Post. They also allege that the federal government is falling far short of obtaining the 3.5 billion masks that officials have long estimated the country would need in a pandemic of this nature. On the contrary, President Trump has said that the country has “tremendous supply to almost all places.” “Words are inadequate to describe the inaction,” said Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas, to the Washington Post on the matter: “So much of this was preventable. It did not have to happen this way.”  Gold standard PPE manufacturer 3M has filed 10 lawsuits in the last several weeks against people purporting to sell their masks without an actual legitimate business connection to the company, according to the New York Times. 3M has also set up a hotline for anyone in the U.S. or Canada to call in and report scammers and counterfeiters pretending to sell their equipment.    SEC Cracks Down On Coronavirus Scams Thanks To An Army Of Whistleblowers (Forbes) ‘No offense, but is this a joke?’ Inside the underground market for face masks.

Covid-19 has killed more Americans than Vietnam and Korean wars. Covid-19 has killed more Americans than both the Vietnam and Korean wars, and the death toll is approaching the roughly 116,000 Americans slain in World War I. New York City is still the global center of the pandemic, with about 16,000 confirmed deaths and nearly 200,000 cases in the five boroughs alone. President Donald Trump and his administration have questioned the official death toll and even suggested the numbers are inflated, with Trump telling reporters Friday that the true number may be lower than the official count. However, Trump’s viewpoint is disputed by the majority of public health experts and statisticians, who say the true death toll of Covid-19 in the U.S. is probably far higher than the official statistics show.  All 50 states have begun to gradually roll back their Covid-19 crackdowns, to varying degrees—while some governors have played it safe, others are reopening their states faster than recommended by the White House’s official guidelines. The pandemic has been increasingly politicized in recent weeks, as Democrats and Republicans grapple with how quickly to reopen business and what kind of safety restrictions should be enacted. A poll released Thursday found that almost one in five Republicans surveyed said they have no interest in a potential Covid-19 vaccine, more than twice as much as Democrats who reported those views. Democrats are largely more supportive of face mask mandates and similar measures, while some Republicans have pushed back and said the government has no place to require citizens to wear face masks. The latest battleground has been America’s churches, with Trump demanding Friday that states allow places of worship to reopen, despite reports of new viral clusters linked to church services. He even threatened to order them open himself if governors wouldn’t, despite not having the authority to do so under federal law. While the daily number of new Covid-19 cases and deaths in the U.S. has sloped downward in recent weeks, experts say a second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic is likely, possibly in autumn. The second wave would probably be even worse than the first, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Robert Redfield said last month. If it hits in autumn, it would coincide with the annual flu season and put even more pressure on the already-strained U.S. healthcare system.

[+] Regional Medical Center Inc. in Atlantic City, New Jersey, U.S., on Thursday, April 16, 2020. Photographer: Angus Mordant/Bloomberg The Joint Commission, accreditor of thousands of U.S. healthcare facilities, is set to resume its surveys in June as hospitals and health systems re-open to visitors and begin to return hospital operations to a new normal. The Joint Commission accredits and certifies more than 21,000 hospitals, health systems, facilities and programs in the U.S. Health facilities stripped of Joint Commission accreditation could find their Medicare funding in jeopardy. But the powerful healthcare industry accreditor put its surveys on hold effective March 16 as U.S. health facilities focused on treating a surge of patients sickened by the Coronavirus strain COVID-19.  “The Joint Commission’s decision to suspend regular on-site surveys allowed health care organizations and professionals to concentrate on preparing and caring for patients with COVID-19,” said Joint Commission president and chief executive Dr. Mark Chassin. In many cases, hospitals didn’t want to be distracted by Joint Commission surveyors even though patient safety is key to the accreditation process. The Joint Commission said there may have been a small number of surveys, however, that continued in some cases “such as high-risk situations.” “The Joint Commission is committed to working closely with organizations, with safety being the first and foremost priority,” the Joint Commission said in a Wednesday memo to healthcare facilities.  The resumption of Joint Commission surveys comes as the Trump administration, U.S. and state health departments intensify their own guidelines and safety precautions in an array of health facilities, particularly nursing homes that have been ravaged by COVID-19. Nursing homes have come under intense fire with some reports estimating one- third or more of all COVID-19 deaths being nursing home patients or workers. “During the time of suspended surveys, we focused on advocating for healthcare workers and for health care organizations while providing them with COVID-19 related resources remotely,” Chassin said.  Once Joint Commission surveys resume, they will include efforts to assess patient safety and the related impact from the pandemic.  “As we start to resume surveys and reviews, account executives will begin to contact organizations due for a survey to assess the impact that the coronavirus pandemic had on their operations and their current state,” the Joint Commission memo says. “The Joint Commission is reviewing a variety of factors and criteria for determining where and which organizations will be surveyed, including identifying and then prioritizing low-risk areas in which we can go in safely to survey.” The Joint Commission said its survey process will look “somewhat different” given the need to “employ physical distancing practices.” There will be, for example, need to limit “individuals in group sessions” and use audio and video conference calls. Full coverage and live updates on the CoronavirusThe stock market finished higher on Wednesday, with the Dow and S&P 500 both clearing critical milestones as investors cheered a reopening of the economy and a potential coronavirus vaccine. The S&P 500 also broke above 3,000, its best close since March. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 2.2%, over 500 points, on Wednesday, while the S&P 500 was up 1.5% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 0.8%. The Dow closed above 25,000 and the S&P broke 3,000, both for their first time since March—showing the market’s recovery from the coronavirus downturn. The market has been moving higher thanks to increasing optimism on Wall Street, with states beginning to reopen businesses and several companies working on potential coronavirus vaccines. Investors rotated out of stocks that benefited from stay-at-home orders, such as Zoom and Shopify. Those that would benefit from an economic reopening jumped on Wednesday, including cruise stocks, airlines, banks and even some retailers.  Adding to the good news: Earlier this week, biotech company Novavax said that it had started the first clinical trial for its experimental coronavirus vaccine, while pharmaceutical giant Merck announced that it is working with scientific research organization IAVI to develop a vaccine. Tech stocks lagged for most of Wednesday, with the likes of Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google-parent Alphabet all losing ground before paring back some of their losses. “The stock market is pricing in a faster than expected recovery,” says Andrew Smith, chief investment strategist at Delos Capital Advisors. “We expect further volatility as the economy starts to reopen,” he says, adding that his firm has tilted out of defensive sectors like consumer staples and utilities and into sectors tied to economic rebounds, such as financials and industrials. Rising U.S.-China tensions. Many experts are worried about a derailment of the phase one trade deal—something Trump has repeatedly threatened to do. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told Congress on Wednesday that Hong Kong is no longer “politically autonomous” from China. Not only does that threaten U.S.-China trade, it could also result in new sanctions on Chinese officials. The European Commission announced plans on Wednesday for a $826.5 billion recovery fund to help deal with the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic.

Topline: As the coronavirus pandemic keeps Americans confined to their homes, nearly every industry has been negatively impacted by the disease, and businesses losing out on cash flow have started laying off workers. Here’s who’s axed staff so far:                                   What to watch for: If any U.S. airlines end up laying off workers. Delta Airlines said it would cut flights and freeze hiring. American Airlines is also cutting flights, and delaying trainings for new flight attendants and pilots. United Airlines said it might have to reduce its staff this fall if economic recovery proves to be slow. What we don’t know: Exactly how many restaurant workers have been laid off due to the pandemic. New York City, a dining mecca, has about 27,000 eating and drinking establishments that were staffed by over 300,000 people. Restaurants are able to fulfill delivery and takeout orders, but can do so using skeleton crews. Big number: 50%. That’s how many U.S. companies are considering layoffs, according to a survey released by Challenger, Gray & Christmas, the country’s oldest outplacement firm. The Federal Reserve of St. Louis estimated that 47 million jobs could be lost due to the coronavirus crisis. These numbers come on the heels of the 30 million American workers who filed for unemployment since the crisis began, according to data released Thursday, an all-time high.  Key background: There are now over 1.6 million reported coronavirus cases in the U.S. and nearly 100,000 deaths, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Worldwide cases now amount to over 5.6 million infected and 355,000 dead. President Trump signed a coronavirus relief bill into law that provides free testing and paid sick leave, along with a $2 trillion stimulus package and a subsequent $484 billion relief bill. At least 42 states have enacted stay-at-home orders that affect 316 million people or more. Cancelations of concerts, sports leagues, festivals, religious gatherings and other large events have impacted millions of people. President Trump enacted a travel ban from Europe that sent airlines and travelers scrambling to adjust, before declaring a national state of emergency. Most U.S. states are beginning to ease restrictions, but most health experts agree that social distancing and strict reopening protocols for businesses continue to be necessary to reduce the virus’ spread. But the uncertainty over how and when the entire country—and its citizens—can resume normal life is a specter hanging over businesses, as they decide whether to cut workers.

Widespread unemployment could linger longer than expected and slow an economic recovery. Goldman expects the U.S. unemployment rate to peak at 25% amid the coronavirus pandemic, according to a recent note from its chief economist Jan Hatzius. The national jobless rate is likely to remain high for longer than expected: While many workers are on “temporary layoff,” not all of them will be rehired quickly, the firm points out.  High unemployment will linger because of policies that discourage workers from returning to their jobs, Goldman says: “Compared with a European-style system that is more focused on job preservation [via wage subsidies], many more will thus have to find truly new jobs.” Countries like the United States that rely on enhanced unemployment benefits have thus “created significant incentives against maintaining existing employment relationships,” which will weaken over time.  A majority of American workers now get higher incomes from unemployment than they do from being employed, especially in low-wage sectors, Hatzius notes. That will result in a situation where the U.S. jobless rate will stay around 12% by the end of 2020 and still be at 8% through 2021—“well above the levels in most other advanced economies,” Goldman’s top economist predicts. “We conclude that the U.S. unemployment crisis will not stand in the way of a near-term economic recovery but is also unlikely to go away quickly,” Hatzius summarized. Unemployment rose to record highs in nearly every state last month: 43 of them surged to historic levels of joblessness in April, according to a recent breakdown from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That’s how many Americans have filed for unemployment benefits over the past nine weeks, according to the Labor Department’s weekly jobless claims reports. The coronavirus has caused the highest rate of U.S. unemployment seen since the 1929 Great Depression. The national jobless rate hit a post-World War II era high, soaring to 14.7% last month—up from 4.4% in March. Before the outbreak hit the U.S. in late February, the unemployment rate had been at a 50-year low of 3.5%.

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey has called for the police officer who knelt on George Floyd's neck just ... [+] before his death to be charged. Frey publicly asked Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman to press charges against the Minneapolis police officer at a Wednesday afternoon press conference. The officer in question was recorded kneeling on Floyd’s neck during an arrest in a video that went global online Monday evening, sparking an outcry at what appeared to be the latest in a string of cases of brutal police treatment of African Americans. Frey declined to specify particular charges he would like to see filed against the officer. Four police officers were fired Tuesday in connection with the arrest, which Frey said was “the right call.”  “I’ve wrestled with, more than anything else over the last 36 hours, one fundamental question,” Frey told reporters at the press conference Wednesday. “Why is the man who killed George Floyd not in jail? If you had done it, or I had done it, we would be behind bars right now.” Floyd’s death sparked an outraged protest in Minneapolis Tuesday night, with thousands marching to demand justice for Floyd from the spot where he was pinned down to the police department’s Third Precinct. Run-ins between the protesters and responding officers reportedly grew tense at some points. Local media reported that protesters smashed precinct and police cars’ windows, while officers used tear gas to break up the crowds. A prayer vigil to remember Floyd, who grew up in Houston, was held in Houston’s Emancipation Park and attended by his friends and family. Floyd was raised in The Third Ward, a longtime center of the city’s vibrant black community and civil rights activism in Houston. He had only moved to Minneapolis in 2018, according to the Houston Chronicle. A video of Floyd’s run-in with police went viral on social media Monday evening. The clip, recorded by a bystander, shows a white police officer pressing a knee to Floyd’s neck for about eight minutes while he lies handcuffed on the ground as horrified onlookers plead with the officer to stop. In the video, Floyd appears to become unresponsive and is wheeled away on a stretcher by paramedics to a hospital, where he was declared dead shortly after. A witness on the scene told NBC News that Floyd was “clearly trying to tell them he couldn’t breathe,” while he was being restrained, adding that “[the police] ignored him.” The officers suspected Floyd of trying to use a counterfeit $20 bill at a convenience store, according to The Star Tribune. Floyd’s family have retained the services of Benjamin Crump, a well-known civil rights attorney who previously represented the family of Michael Brown, a black teenager whose 2014 killing by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, helped propel the Black Lives Matter movement into national prominence. The case is being investigated by both the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension and the FBI.

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is reminding taxpayers that some Economic Impact Payments, sometimes called stimulus checks, are being sent by prepaid debit card. The debit cards arrive in a plain envelope from “Money Network Cardholder Services.”  No, that’s not a joke. As I reported earlier, nearly 4 million people are being sent their Economic Impact Payment by prepaid debit card, instead of a paper check. According to the IRS, if you receive your stimulus check as a prepaid debit card, it will arrive in a plain envelope from “Money Network Cardholder Services.” The Visa 
  
  V 
  name will appear on the front of the card; the back of the card has the name of the issuing bank, MetaBank®, N.A. The information included in the envelope will explain that the card is your Economic Impact Payment Card. In contrast, paper checks will be sent in a marked envelope from the U.S. Treasury. The abrupt change from paper checks to debit cards is causing confusion for some folks (perhaps leading to today’s announcement). Earlier this week, Bonnie Moore and her husband, Thomas, received their stimulus check in the form of a debit card. Mistaking it for another junk mail credit card offer, Bonnie cut it up.  Her neighbor, Jay Bender, almost threw his out, too, commenting that printing on the envelope, “Doesn’t sound like the federal government to me.” The prepaid debit card is intended to be convenient. According to the IRS, those who receive their stimulus check by prepaid debit card can do the following without any fees:   However, there is one fee not mentioned on the list. The cost for a replacement card? $7.50 ($17 additional charge for priority shipment). Bonnie Moore found that out the hard way. So, use care when opening the mail. Nearly four million debit cards are being sent out, with the first wave in mid-May. Currently, the IRS is not allowing folks to opt into (or out of) receiving their payment via prepaid debit card.  How can you tell if you should expect a debit card? If there is a method to the IRS’ madness, they’re not sharing, stating merely that, “The determination of which taxpayers received a debit card was made by the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, a part of the Treasury Department that works with the IRS to handle distribution of the payments.” The IRS encourages you to visit EIPcard.com for more information about prepaid debit cards.

Moore, a physician assistant working on the frontlines in the emergency department at the University of Vermont Medical Center, decided that instead of wearing his gown, he would repurpose it as personal protective equipment (PPE) for other healthcare workers on the frontlines of the coronavirus pandemic.  This inspired him to launch Gowns4Good, an initiative that collects gowns and repurposes them as PPE. And in just over a month’s time, Moore has collected over 10,000 gowns.  “Gowns4good was founded to solve two problems with one solution,” said Moore.  “The first problem,” he explained, “was witnessing my colleagues on the front lines of this pandemic lacking the appropriate PPE. As a physician assistant working in the emergency department treating Covid-19 patients, I was struck by the image of my fellow healthcare workers using trash bags or other alternative forms of PPE. I wanted to brainstorm a way to keep them protected. Secondly, I was heartbroken for all the graduating students whose commencement ceremonies were being postponed or canceled to adhere to social distancing guidelines.”  “Then, it clicked that there could be a helpful connection here,” said Moore.  “By donating the new or used graduation gowns to medical workers, we could both protect those on the front lines and also honor our graduating students; we could take action from our homes and actually create an impact during these uncertain times,” he added. Moore explained that in order to honor students’ academic achievements, the company is mailing Gowns4Good logos to all donors along with instructions for students to attach it to the mortarboards of their graduation caps. Students with altered commencement plans are encouraged to “wear the cap and donate the gown!”  The Outcry for PPE PPE shortages have been a crucial issue since the beginning of the pandemic, weighting heavily on the minds of healthcare providers working on the frontlines of the pandemic.  Dr. Megan Ranney, Associate Professor of Emergency Medicine at Brown University and co-founder of the movement, #GetUsPPE, has been instrumental in raising the collective voice of all healthcare providers regarding the urgency of PPE on the frontlines of the pandemic.  Ranney is joined by colleagues, Dr. Esther Choo, Associate Professor of Emergency Medicine at Oregon Health and Science University, Dr. Shuhan He, Attending Physician at Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Dr. Ali Raja, Executive Vice Chair of Emergency Medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital, Dr. Jeremy Faust, Attending Physician at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Department of Emergency Medicine, Instructor at Harvard Medical School and Dr. Seth Trueger, Assistant Professor of Emergency Medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine along with additional physicians making up their team for #GetUs PPE. In launching this effort, Ranney wrote an article in the New England Journal of Medicine urging Trump to use the Defense Production Act (DPA) to mass produce PPE, while also asking key stakeholders in the private sector to join in this critical effort. Her initiative also took her to Congress, where she was asked to submit recommendations before Congress on the most important aspects of the Covid-19 Stimulus Bill. She urged congressional members to focus on health security of all Americans, with a particular focus on minorities, while investing money in public health initiatives.  “We still face major shortages in PPE for healthcare workers across the country,” said Ranney. “The types of PPE needed are changing - for example, at #GetUsPPE we are now seeing dramatic increases in demand for gowns and for cleaning wipes, both of which are new. But the need is still there—we continue to receive tens of thousands of requests for all types of PPE each week. And prices for PPE continue to be through the roof.”  Ranney qualified that “major hospital systems are by and large able to fill their needs at this point, but are still needing to reuse PPE in ways that would have been considered unacceptable 4 months ago (e.g., reusing a surgical mask for an entire day or an entire week). Smaller hospitals, clinics, nursing homes, and home healthcare workers continue to lack the means or connections to purchase PPE, however.” “One of the highest current needs is disposable and reusable gowns,” explained Ranney. “Using old graduation gowns is a great idea, with the caution that these may not be adequate in all settings (e.g., in settings where this is more likely to be a fluid spill). As we use homemade and recycled PPE, it's essential for us to make sure that we provide supplies that keep our healthcare workers safe,” she added. Re-purposing What We Have   The lack of adequate PPE for healthcare workers throughout the world weighed heavily on Moore as he was working in the emergency department at the University of Vermont Medical Center during the early days of the pandemic. Using a graduation gown, his goal was to launch a sustainable concept, a better substitute for PPE—compared to trash bags with holes cut out for arms—for use in hospital settings. Moore explained that gowns are much more effective than other alternatives to PPE as a result of three key aspects: length, sleeves and the presence and location of the zippers in their construction.  “Compared to trash bags or other alternative forms of PPE, graduation gowns are more effective given their length, sleeves, and easy donning and doffing with zippered access,” said Moore. “When worn backwards, they have a high riding neckline and provide the necessary coverage to the critical zones of exposure: the chest, waist, and forearms.” Moore further explained that “although efforts are being made to increase PPE production, worldwide demand is increasing too quickly. There are so many new gowns that will go unworn as graduations are being canceled and used gowns collecting dust in people’s closets. Why not put these gowns to better use? There is no better way to honor your senior or your alma mater than to donate to desperate healthcare workers.” As a recent MBA graduate Moore was able to use the skills he practiced as a student to effectively launch his company and make it a success. “The skills collected while pursuing my MBA at the University of Vermont have been critical in the execution of this initiative,” he emphasized. “In just days, we went from a hypothetical idea to a fully functioning organization making national headlines helping those in need.”  “I utilized my classroom experience to optimize a strategy to build a successful endeavor; courses in marketing, finance, data compilation, strategy, law, sustainable innovation, web design, branding, etc. all culminated to create the foundation of knowledge to execute such an effort,” added Moore. He also credits his team as part of his success. “Like any successful project, it is only as good as your teammates. Taran, Ally, Cody, Jackson, and Rob have been an invaluable asset to making this initiative operational: with their individual expertise, collaborative efforts, and a drive to make an impact through these uncertain times, we put our MBA to good use to help those on the front lines during the worldwide pandemic.”  These skills and compassion will serve Moore well as he plans to begin medical school this Fall at The Robert Larner College of Medicine at the University of Vermont.

(Photo by Ahmet Bolat/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images) The SARS-CoV-2 virus typically enters the body by attaching itself to a structure on the surface of our nasal membranes. This is the protein ACE2. Once inside the body, the virus moves around by attaching to the same ACE2 protein on other tissues deep in the lungs, the heart, and the kidneys. The receptor can also be found in the lining of blood vessels, and possibly even the taste buds on our tongues. This is one reason why Covid-19 patients may present such a diverse set of symptoms. A paper recently published in JAMA examines one measure of the amount of receptors in the noses of children and adults. I say one measure because what is measured is not the protein responsible for attachment, but rather the RNA which directs its production. Usually but not always, the amount of RNA in cells determines the amount of the corresponding protein. The authors assume that is the case, and their conclusion depends on that assumption. With that caveat in mind, they report finding less ACE2 RNA in cells scraped from the noses of children than in those from adults. Participants in the study were divided into four age groups: less than ten, 10-17, 18-24, and older than 24.  The first conclusion is there was no difference in the amount of ACE2 RNA detected according to gender or those with or without asthma. The second conclusion is that the amount of ACE2 RNA increases with each age group.  The differences are relatively small and the error bars large. The average relative amount of RNA ranges from 2.4 for those less than 10 to 3.09 for those 25 and older. However, when the probable range is included, the results from the three older groups overlap, as do the results from the three younger groups.   Can we conclude that such differences imply a difference in overall susceptibility to infection? Possibly, but not certainly. We do not know how many receptors are needed for the SARS-CoV-2 virus to successfully infect us. Clearly children, even very young children, can be infected. Additionally, we do not know the efficiency of the conversion of RNA to the stable ACE2 protein that serves as a receptor. Also unknown is whether or not there are age related biological and behavioral factors other than ACE2 which determine susceptibility to infection. Such is science. We must collect data, analyze it for accuracy, and infer its meaning. Our job is to do our best to disprove our favorite hypothesis, so that it remains the only explanation left standing. Does this paper “prove” children are less susceptible to Covid-19 infection? Alas, no. Does it advance our understanding of ACE2 expression in the noses of different age groups? Marginally, yes.

Brazil’s Health Ministry reported 1,039 new Covid-19 deaths Tuesday evening, compared to 592 deaths reported by the U.S.’ Centers for Disease Control.  Tuesday is the fifth day in a row that Brazil has reported the world’s highest number of daily Covid-19 deaths, totaling nearly 25,000 since the country counted its first case in late February. The U.S. has been the hardest-hit country in the world for much of the pandemic, but Brazil’s steep fatality rate and increasing number of daily deaths indicate it is rapidly becoming the new Covid-19 hot spot. The country saw an average of 935 deaths per day last week, with close to 1,200 deaths on Thursday alone, though most experts believe the fatalities have been undercounted—perhaps by as much as 40%, according to some scientists’ estimates. President Jair Bolsonaro has seen his popularity drop significantly since the pandemic began, as he downplays the severity of the virus and continuously attacks social distancing measures, saying a weakened economy could be more deadly than the virus itself. But 60% of Brazilians support stricter shelter-in-place orders according to a poll released Wednesday, while another poll found 58% of respondents were in favor of Bolsonaro being impeached. Experts believe Covid-19 cases and deaths will only continue to rise in Brazil in the following weeks. According to a Pan American Health Organization model, Brazil could count nearly 89,000 virus deaths by early August. The World Health Organization said Tuesday that the Americas are developing into the new global center of the Covid-19 pandemic, with new cases and deaths expected to continue in Latin American countries throughout the rest of the summer. Brazil was the first Latin American country to report a Covid-19 case on February 26, 2020, and still has the most in the region by far. Experts say sweeping poverty and rampant inequality in Brazil makes the country particularly vulnerable to the virus.

[+] the curve of infection as President Trump and Dr. Deborah Birx, response coordinator for the White House Coronavirus Task Force, look on. “We have a good chance—if all the things fall in the right place—that we might have a vaccine that would be deployable by the end of the year, by November-December,” Dr. Fauci said on CNN Wednesday morning. Fauci explained that the vaccine trials with Niaid are proceeding “at risk,” meaning researchers are taking “the next steps before the results of the previous step,” which can shorten the development process by months.  He also did not rule out the possibility that there may be a second wave of coronavirus: “It could happen, but it is not inevitable.” Many pharmaceutical companies are racing to produce a vaccine as quickly as possible; Pfizer chief Albert Bourla has challenged his team to a “moon-shot-like goal” of having millions of doses of a vaccine distributed to the public by the end of the year.  The FDA has fast-tracked vaccine trials and the Department of Health and Human Services has already signed contracts ordering $100 million worth of needles and syringes for a “Covid-19 mass vaccination campaign.”  Vaccines usually take much longer than a year to go from development to mass market: the fastest entirely new vaccine developed in the United States took four years—it took 20 months for researchers just to bring a vaccine to clinical trial for the 2002-03 SARS outbreak. Former FDA chief Scott Gottlieb also said Wednesday that a widely available vaccine is “probably a 2021 event,” saying on CNBC that “we’ll have to have one more cycle of this virus in the fall, heading into the winter, before we get to a vaccine.” Similarly, Merck

Last week, a scientific report from Stat News flagged issues around lack of data and methodology to back much of the optimism held for Moderna’s vaccine, purported as the U.S. FDA’s vaccine front-runner. The scientific community has also raised skepticism around the University of Oxford’s vaccine due to their use of press release rather than traditional methods of scientific announcement (via studies and journal articles) to communicate developments around their vaccine. There are 10 Covid-19 vaccines currently undergoing human trials, according to the World Health Organization, with 114 others in preclinical trials.   Scientists Raise Questions About Moderna Vaccine In Market-Shaking Report (Forbes) Dr. Fauci Says Staying Closed Too Long Could Cause Irreversible Damage, But Urges States To Take ‘Very Significant Precautions’ (Forbes) Dr. Scott Gottlieb warns that widespread vaccinations for coronavirus by year-end look unlikely (CNBC) Draft landscape of COVID-19 candidate vaccines (World Health Organization) With big talk and hurled insults, the gloves come off in the race for the coronavirus vaccine (CNN) Full coverage and live updates on the CoronavirusNeonatologist Valentina Gerginova prepares a dose of BCG vaccine in Vita private hospital in Sofia ...

A new nationwide poll of more than 1,000 adults conducted May 14-18, 2020 by the Associated Press—NORC Center for Public Affairs Research reveals that 49% of respondents plan to get vaccinated while 20% say they will not. Another 31% say they are just not sure.  Of those who say they will get a vaccine, 56% are white, 25% are black and 37% Hispanic. The vast majority say they would agree to it in order to protect themselves and their families.  Among the 20% who say they will definitely avoid a vaccine, they list fear of side effects as the main reason for their decision. The second top reason for avoiding it is fear of contracting the illness from the vaccine.  In terms of the timeline for a vaccine, 61% of people believe one will be available by the end of the year while 17% think it will take longer.  The margin of sampling error is plus or minus 4.2 percentage points, the researchers say.

Tensions erupted on the air during CNBC’s Squawk Box after Kernen criticized Sorkin for being excessively pessimistic during the outbreak, leading to a shouting match between the two anchors.  “You panicked about the market, panicked about Covid, panicked about the ventilators, panicked about the PPE, panicked about ever going out again, panicked if we’d ever get back to normal,” Kernan said. That prompted an angry rebuttal from Sorkin, who accused Kernen of downplaying the death toll and going to bat for President Donald Trump. “Joseph, you didn’t panic about anything!” Sorkin responded. “100,000 people died, Joe, and all you did was tried to help your friend the president.” “That’s what you did! Every single morning on this show . . . you used and abused your position,” Sorkin alleged.  Kernen described the accusations as “totally unfair,” and despite Sorkin’s pleas to move on and “do the news,” he continued the fiery exchange, saying that he was just trying to help “investors keep their cool.” “I wasn’t arguing to go sell your stocks, Joseph, I was arguing about people’s lives,” Sorkin said. “I’m begging you to do the news.” Sorkin is a financial columnist for the New York Times and has been a co-anchor on CNBC’s Squawk Box since 2011. He is also founder and editor of “DealBook,” a financial newsletter published daily by the Times. Kernen, who first had a career as a stockbroker, is a 25-year veteran co-host of Squawk Box.

(Photo by BEN STANSALL / AFP) / TO GO WITH AFP STORY BY JOE JACKSON (Photo by BEN STANSALL/AFP via Getty Images) The virus that causes Covid-19, SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-2), has a nasty trick up its sleeve.  Upon infection, most viruses trigger a vigorous immune response from both arms of the immune system: a lymphoid response and a myeloid response. Interferons released from infected cells trigger the lymphoid response, resulting in antivirus antibodies which bind to and eliminate the virus from the body. T cells are also activated that can recognize and eliminate infected cells. The myeloid pathway works differently. Myeloid cells attack the virus and the infected cells directly. Some myeloid cells engulf and destroy virus particles, others kill the infected cells directly, and others still induce a protective inflammatory response by release of compounds called cytokines. The way SARS-2 affects both arms of the immune response is different from other viruses. The lymphoid pathway is muted and the myeloid pathway hyperactive. This helps explain why some people who recover from Covid-19 have very low, sometimes undetectable levels of anti-SARS-2 antibodies, and others have undetectable levels of “neutralizing” antibodies capable of the inactivating virus in laboratory experiments.  Failure to induce high levels of protective antibodies may also be related to a poor memory of prior infections. The upshot is the real possibility that protection following infection may be transient. We know that people who recover from coronavirus colds can be reinfected by the same strain of virus a year later. We will learn over time whether that is true of Covid-19 as well. A hyperactive myeloid response, on the other hand, can result in the famous cytokine storm associated with the rapid decline and death of Covid-19 patients. The two phenomena may in fact be linked. An ineffective or weak lymphoid response may lead to prolific virus replication. Large amounts of virus can in turn trigger a violent myeloid response, in some cases violent enough to kill. Detailed studies reveal how SARS-2 virus pulls off this trick. In addition to the genes the virus needs to reproduce—the replicative enzymes and the proteins that comprise the outer and inner shells the virus—coronaviruses produce many other proteins. They all go by the generic name open reading frame gene (orf), followed by a number and sometimes an additional letter to distinguish one from the other. That’s because we don’t know much about them or what they do, besides the fact that most aren’t needed to grow the virus in a test tube. This reminds me of my earlier work with HIV-1, the virus that causes AIDS. My Harvard group discovered six such proteins. Two were absolutely required for virus replication in a test tube, but the other four were not. Years of extensive study revealed that in fact, these proteins provided HIV-1 with a bag of tricks that allowed it to survive not only in the test tube, but in the much more rigorous environment of our bodies. I’ll bet dollars to donuts that a similar focus on the so called “accessory genes" of the Covid-19 viruses will reveal another set of tools they use to do their dirty work. And there are a lot of them. After all, SAR-2 contains three times the amount of genetic information as HIV-1. We have a hint of how one of those genes, named orf3b, works. Initial studies of SARS-1, the virus that caused the earlier SARS epidemic, reveal that the protein made by the orf3b down regulates the production interferons needed to trigger the first arm of the immune system—the lymphoid pathway responsible for producing antibodies and killer T cells. A recent study shows that the orf3b protein of SARS-2 does the same thing, only better. The protein made by orf3b in most strains of SARS-2 is shorter and more potent in tamping down the interferon response than that of SARS-1. That may be one of the reasons SARS-2 can be transmitted more efficiently than SARS-1. A weaker antibody response means than more virus particles are made.  There is an ominous twist to the story. Two strains of SARS-2 isolated from very ill patients carry yet a third variant of orf3B. This variant is longer than that of the original SARS-1 gene. When tested, it turns out to be more potent than either in its ability to compromise the interferon response. The implication? This may be one of the first signs that a more transmissible and lethal strain of SARS-2 will emerge, one that accelerates the pandemic still further. Watch this space! In dampening the antibody response to infection and ramping up production of chemokines, SARS-2 is amplifying what happens to us naturally as our immune systems age. While our ability to mount an effective antibody and T cell response to new infections declines, the myeloid arm of the immune system becomes overactive. These features of the aging immune system account for both the decline in our response to new vaccines and to an increase in inflammatory auto-immune disease such as rheumatoid arthritis. Blood cell generation from the pluripotent stem cell showing predisposition toward the myeloid ... [+] lineage with aging. Immunological changes associated with aging and adaptive immunosenescence. In other words, infection by SARS-2 tips the balance of a mis-regulated immune system still further, explaining what we know all too well: older people are at far higher risk of serious disease and dying from Covid-19 than the young. Every day we learn more about this virus and the disease it causes. Thank heavens that international cooperation and data sharing is at an unprecedented high. It is clear that we have a lot more to learn about how the virus goes about its business and how our bodies react to it. With each new insight come fresh ideas of how to protect ourselves. For now, I will give you just one. If one of the problems is that the virus down-regulates interferon production, why not supplement those infected with interferons we already use in the treatment of other diseases? Well, one of the two drugs added to a four-drug regimen—what I call the "Hong Kong Cocktail”—that reduces viral load and hastens the healing of mild to moderately ill Covid-19 patients is... an interferon! We are in this for the long haul. The scientific journey is just getting underway. I am confident that we can beat this disease with a combination of enlightened public health policies, transparent rigorous clinical trials, and the power of our science.

As Americans abide by “stay-at-home” orders and hospitals and other health facilities postpone elective procedures, the Kaiser survey sheds light on a change in the desire to access healthcare. Some worry delaying these procedures and avoiding primary care could lead to more serious illness and higher healthcare costs in the future.  Still, the good news is that most Americans plan to obtain healthcare once stay-at-home restrictions ease, the Kaiser analysis says. The survey said 68% of those who delayed care expect to “get the delayed care in the next three months.” “Most of those who have put off care due to coronavirus expect to get it soon,” said Kaiser Family Foundation president and chief executive Drew Altman. “If they do, health care utilization may bounce back more quickly than the rest of the economy.” Health insurance companies including Anthem, the Aetna unit of CVS Health, Cigna and UnitedHealth Group reported a boost in first quarter profits in part because medical expenses were down as elective procedures were cancelled or postponed. Health insurers have, however, waived co-pays and related cost-sharing so Americans have fewer financial barriers to obtaining primary care related to the Coronavirus strain COVID-19. Here are some other highlights of the new Kaiser poll:  * - 86% of adults say their “physical health has stayed about the same since the outbreak began.” * - 39% of adults say “worry and stress related to coronavirus has had a negative impact on their mental health.” Full coverage and live updates on the CoronavirusXpresSpa is about to start Covid-19 testing at the first of what could be multiple airports in the ... [+] U.S. Its stores can be found at 46 locations in 23 gateways. The largest operator of health and wellness spa retail services at U.S. airports has repurposed its currently shuttered business to screen and test for Covid-19, beginning with John F. Kennedy Airport “within a few weeks.” XpresSpa Group, whose sales were $48.5 million last year, has signed a contract with JFK International Air Terminal LLC—the private operator of Terminal 4— to provide diagnostic tests for Covid-19, initially to airport and airline staff. The pilot concept paves the way for the company to enter the medical sphere and widen its reach within the health and wellness segment in which it has been a player for 15 years. Doug Satzman, CEO of XpresSpa Group since February 2019, tells me: “Initially we thought this might be a short-term project—perhaps six months or so to help alleviate the crisis. But we now believe it will evolve into a separate line of business.” The decision to reposition came in early March when only half of the company’s portfolio of 51 airport locations was still open and “sales were falling by the day” recalls Satzman, who built his retail expertise through a 14-year career with Starbucks. By March 24, thanks to the Covid-19 outbreak, all of the company’s global spas were closed. “Our board chairman Bruce Bernstein came up with the idea to repurpose our real estate temporarily as Covid-19 testing centers. It was a way to keep our spaces active during this time,” says Satzman. In Terminal 4, a modular facility has been developed pre-security with nine separate rooms that can administer over 500 tests per day. They will be a combination of nasal swabs and blood antibody tests for off-premise analysis. Future airport test spaces could be located within existing XpresSpa retail areas, which are mostly airside, or in a pre-security area like the pilot. In total, XpresSpa has 46 locations at 23 airports in the U.S. to choose from. Commenting on the first test site Satzman says: “We are hopeful that this will serve as a model in other U.S. airports. As businesses start returning, airline and airport workforces will be critical to getting aviation back into play safely. We are positioning ourselves to support that.”  The Nasdaq-listed health and wellness company says it is working with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey—which runs John F. Kennedy Airport as well as Newark and LaGuardia—to expand testing sites. Once confirmed, they could roll out this summer.  Making the move from retail spas to coronavirus testing at airports could be the basis of a new ... [+] business for XpresSpa. Since mid-March XpresSpa had been in discussions with various government agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services about plans to turn its other U.S. airport locations into COVID-19 testing facilities.  The company has the advantage of being in all the biggest U.S. hub airports which are also key point-of-entry cities. They include New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago, Miami, Atlanta, and Washington. XpresSpa’s employees are already TSA security approved so they can be trained and deployed quickly. A new brand and subsidiary for Covid-19 testing XpresSpa has created a new brand, XpresCheck, for its Covid-19 screenings, which will be offered to airline employees, contractors and workers, airport concessionaires and their staff, TSA officers, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents.  XpresCheck is part of a specially-created subsidiary called XpresTest. In April, the company appointed Lewis Lipsey MD as chief medical director of XpresTest to help design Covid-19 protocols, as well as to train employees on testing procedures. Dr. Lipsey is also an attending physician at several hospitals in New York City, including The Mount Sinai, Mount Sinai Beth Israel, and Lenox Hill. Last year, XpresSpa Group held 60% of the U.S. airport spa services market, making it more than three times bigger than its nearest rival, Be Relax. The company’s 51 locations in 25 airports globally include three in Amsterdam Schiphol Airport in the Netherlands, and two in Dubai International Airport in the United Arab Emirates.

It has caused unprecedented suffering and death, not to mention shutting down thriving economies. Emotionally and physically for so many, Covid-19 is a mass trauma. One of the features of trauma is the disorientation, the way none of it makes sense. But research based on first responders to 9/11 has shown that we can recover when we do make sense of it.  Resilience to trauma was a major area of study after 9/11, and one of the labs which studied it was at Binghamton University. That lab has put out a new paper focused on what helped in the past and how that applies to the stress of the Covid-19 pandemic.  “I think an important takeaway from our article is that many individuals exhibit recovery and resilience in response to mass traumas, which is an optimistic finding,” Craig Polizzi, first author of the paper, told me in an email. That perspective is encouraging, coming from someone who referred to Covid-19 as “the invisible enemy, the angel of death, a relentless and soulless invader that has infected the global psyche with fear,” in the paper.  The authors expect that, like past disasters, the coronavirus pandemic will lead to an array of mental illnesses and addictions. Underneath, all of those problems are driven by one key emotion. Fear.  Fear and the related feelings of helplessness and uncertainty are drivers of trauma response. To boost resilience and counteract fear, stress researchers refer to the “3 Cs” model: control, coherence, and connectedness. And that means finding coping strategies to engage all three.  Many people are finding some sense of control by scheduling their days or learning how to protect themselves from the virus. And the surge in video chatting shows how hard we are working to maintain our connection to each other. But for many of us, coherence may be the hardest to find. Traumatic events shock our systems. They don’t fit into the way we think the world works. Even if we do believe such things are part of life, the actual experience is overwhelming. They simply don’t make sense; traumatic events are incoherent.  Getting over something traumatic is impossible until we make sense of it. What do we do with a deadly disease turning our world upside down? We have to develop a narrative that brings meaning to what has happened, and leaves room for hope. According to the study, “coherence, is founded in the deeply human desire to make sense and meaning of the world. Developing a coherent narrative of what has happened and what can be done to live each day safely and fully, is a challenging yet rewarding endeavor.” Whether we recognize it or not, all of us have formed our own narratives to make sense of the coronavirus pandemic. We can’t help it, we are driven to make meaning out of hard times.  The type of narrative we choose will have a lot to do with whether we develop mental health problems during Covid-19 or not. And we also respond to different narratives based on what scares us most.  For instance, many people are drawn to narratives that provide a sense of control by making the world feel less chaotic. Chaos is scary, but conspiracy theories, as odd as they may seem to many, provide a compelling story that someone is pulling the strings. That’s the appeal of Plandemic, or of the idea that the virus was intentionally created or spread. (It wasn’t. Nature sucks sometimes.) And of course, a narrative that says the virus doesn’t actually exist so it’s safe to go out helps people avoid dealing with the problem entirely. Unfortunately, that denial could be fatal if they get sick with Covid-19.  But what if we consider a narrative about coming together and facing this in our shared humanity? What if our narrative includes our strengths, or our caring for each other? Narratives rich in connection and love can lead to much better mental health outcomes. If the idea of “developing a coherent narrative” sounds like a lot, it can help to have a starting point. The study authors have one to suggest called acceptance based coping.  So much of the stress we feel when faced with trauma is the effort of avoiding the unpleasant emotions that the trauma causes. That’s where the term “triggering” comes from. A trigger is something that reminds us of the traumatic event brings up related emotions. Most of us avoid triggers, and in so doing we make it harder for ourselves to bounce back.  The idea behind acceptance based coping is not to change what has happened or our feelings about it. We can’t. Instead, we want to change how we relate to our feelings and the uncontrollable events that triggered them. The goal, according to the study, is to become “nonjudgmentally aware of the flux of internal states that arise in response to them (e.g., fears, doubts, self-blame) in an accepting and planful manner.”  Wait. That’s mindfulness. And mindfulness could be a problem because of a common mistake people make when they try it. Jamie Gruman recently pointed this out in Psychology Today. He reviewed the research showing that mindfulness can cause harm if people simply use it to focus on their experiences. Mindfulness used successfully involves both experiencing our emotions AND accepting them. Without the acceptance, focusing on our experiences has been associated with poor mental health outcomes.  The authors of this study agree, and emphasize the acceptance part of mindfulness. They point out that “learning that a ‘thought is just a thought’ or that worries are evanescent and morph transparently into another thought or feeling” helps us increase our stress tolerance and makes room for us to enjoy the good things.  “Also, people are unique,” Polizzi wrote in a email, “and the way they cope should be consistent with their unique needs and values. As such, we suggested a variety of techniques so people can determine the strategies that work best for them during this perilous time. For example, I enjoy practicing mindfulness during my day where I take several minutes to notice my thoughts and emotions. But other people may enjoy journaling or painting about their experience while others may be more inclined to volunteer or talk to loved ones to cope with stress.”  After 9/11, finding meaning made all the difference for mental health. According to the study, “those people who found meaning in the attacks by aligning with their personal values... and responsibilities, while acknowledging the emotional weight of the attack, fared particularly well in terms of low rates of psychological complications and increased resilience.” Notice that key phrase: “while acknowledging the emotional weight of the attack.” That’s the truly difficult part. We haven’t found coherence or healing until we have felt the grief.  It’s a heavy time as all of humanity faces a disease on a scale we have not known in generations. The way through starts with acknowledging that it has happened and will be with us for some time to come. That’s when we show our resilience. Full coverage and live updates on the CoronavirusIf you think the grim coronavirus death toll is causing health care workers everywhere to always wash their hands, think again. Surprisingly, the Covid pandemic may not have significantly boosted compliance with hand hygiene ... [+] guidelines by doctors and nurses. Photographer: Chris Ratcliffe/Bloomberg  A recent research letter published in The Journal of Hospital Infection examined whether it’s “possible to achieve 100 percent hand hygiene compliance during the Covid-19 pandemic.” The medical center involved in the research, Queen Mary Hospital in Hong Kong, had reached a pre-Covid-19 hand hygiene rate of over 75 percent. Yet the hospital’s goal of complete compliance proved surprisingly elusive. In one pediatric ward devoted to suspected or confirmed Covid-19 patients, doctors and nurses followed hand hygiene rules 100 percent of the time, but in another ward with similar patients and staff, compliance was 83 percent, or about one-fifth less. Given Covid-19’s risk to providers as well as patients, this was “unexpected,” the researchers admitted.  The Queen Mary study supports what infection control experts have long maintained: awareness isn’t enough. Doctors and nurses, particularly during a pandemic, understand that hand hygiene is “the most important intervention” to reduce the staggering death toll from infections, as the American Journal of Infection Control put it. Still, cautions Chris Hermann, a physician and founder of the company Clean Hands-Safe Hands, “Hand hygiene is a simple concept, but to change it is more complex.” There have been literally hundreds of studies on how to get health care workers to consistently wash their hands, with interventions running the gamut from reminder signs to electronic monitoring.  Yet clinicians at U.S. hospitals pre-Covid properly cleaned their hands “less than half the times they should,” according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Even with Covid concerns at the top of mind, doctors and nurses may not perceive when they forget to wash or fail to properly follow the guidelines properly. This misplaced certainty is known as the “overconfidence effect.” It was memorably lampooned by humorist Garrison Keillor in stories about the fictional town of Lake Woebegon, where “all the women are strong, all the men are good-looking, and all the children are above average.” Unfortunately, our national effort to dispel the illusion of hand hygiene competence is truly woebegone. The CDC doesn’t track hospitals’ hand hygiene rates, and neither the government nor private accrediting groups requires hospitals to even reach a certain compliance level. It’s enough to show that you have an improvement program.  Whenever individual hospitals’ hand hygiene rates do become public, it’s clear that prestige doesn’t presage protection. As the journalism group ProPublica reported in early March, just before the number of Covid deaths began to soar, “Infection control has been a recurring problem…at the first tier of treatment centers” designated by the CDC to handle an infectious disease outbreak. In March, the Leapfrog Group’s Leah Binder and I wrote an opinion article calling for an end to the government’s hands-off approach to improving hand hygiene. For now, though, government action seems unlikely. In just a few months, Covid-19 has brought sickness and death to untold numbers of doctors, nurses and others on the front lines of care, as well as to tens of thousands of other Americans they were valiantly trying to help. A crisis, however, cannot by itself instantly cause improvement. “Covid, frankly, is not enough,” says Hermann.  Hermann adds that he’s skeptical that Queen Mary attained the 100 percent hand hygiene compliance it claims, noting that the use of infection control nurses and the small number of patient interactions reported suggests the rate might be much lower when there’s no one around to watch. Nonetheless, Hermann agrees with the conclusion that the commitment “to build up a good hand hygiene culture” by the leadership of the high-performing ward was central to its success.  While it can be difficult to believe that hospital hand hygiene is still a concern post-Covid-19, what’s needed now is changing processes, not blaming people. For the sake of patients and providers alike, the effective tactics and technology that too many hospitals have eschewed, such as better training and electronic monitoring, must be urgently embraced as a matter of life-and-death. Full coverage and live updates on the CoronavirusNevada Governor Steve Sisolak said Tuesday that the state’s casinos, including gambling meccas Las Vegas, are allowed to reopen starting June 4, 2020, capping off two and a half months of unprecedented shutdowns—but with social distancing guidelines and other protective measures in place, betting against the house will likely look different for the foreseeable future. A porter cleans hand rails at the Emerald Island Casino on May 2.  Sisolak, who is self-quarantining in his residence following possible exposure to Covid-19, told reporters Tuesday: “We welcome the visitors from across the country to come here, to have a good time, no different than they did previously, but we’re gonna be cautious.” Nevada’s Gaming Control Board released health and safety guidelines for casinos May 1, which limits occupancy to 50% and requires staff to follow disinfection and social distancing protocols. Plexiglass barriers will likely be new features at card tables and slot machines, along with regulations limiting three players at a time for blackjack and four for poker. Some resorts are planning to use thermal cameras at entrances, plastic barriers at hotel check-in desks and will remove seating from pools and other common areas to enforce social distancing. The reopening date comes over a month after Las Vegas Mayor Carolyn Goodman advocated to use the city as “a control group” for health authorities to measure the effects of lifting restrictions, which drew sharp criticism from a slate of public figures, including CNN anchor Anderson Cooper and late-night host Jimmy Kimmel. Three million. That’s how many monthly visitors Las Vegas welcomed in early 2020, prior to the coronavirus-induced shutdown. “It’s going to bounce back,” El Cortez Hotel & Casino general manager Adam Wiesberg told the New York Times. “Las Vegas is part of the American culture. And I think it will come back better than ever.” Although gamblers can return to Las Vegas’ casinos next week, other parts of its economy, including entertainment and large buffets, will remain on pause. Some casinos could raise minimum bets at card tables to offset some of their lost revenue. Although Sisolak said the casinos could once again shutter if infection rates spike, he was confident about their reopening. “I don’t think you’re going to find a safer place to come to than Las Vegas by June 4, with the protocols that we’ve put in place, than the testing that we’ve put in place, with the contact tracing that will be in place by that time,” he said. “We’re encouraging visitors to come and enjoy themselves and have a good time.” Three Nevada businesses that won’t be cleared for reopening come June 4?

South Korea has recorded 11,200 coronavirus cases, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Dozens of cases have been linked to an e-commerce logistics center owned by online shopping giant Coupang in Seoul. The first case at the warehouse is linked to an outbreak connected to nightclubs in Seoul at the start of the month. Much like Amazon, Coupang has seen a spike in users during the pandemic as consumers look online to get their goods and groceries delivered. In March, daily deliveries rose to 3 million, from 2.2 million in February, Reuters reported. But the center was forced to close on Monday, while the site is being disinfected and 3,600 workers tested. Officials say they are keeping a “close eye” on the facility amod concerns that infections linked to the center could increase. The spike coincides with 2 million children returning to the classroom on Wednesday as South Korea moves into the second phase of its school reopening plan. But students have to adhere to new social distancing measures including using hand sanitizer, masks and temperature checks. South Korea largely managed to stay in control of its coronavirus outbreak without having to implement strict lockdowns seen in hard-hit countries, through a comprehensive testing and tracing strategy. But the latest developments are another setback in the nation’s bid to contain a second wave. Just last month, South Korea reported no new local infections but around May 10, nightclubs across Seoul’s nightlife district closed after a string of cases were linked to one man who had coronavirus and visited the sites. 6-Year-Old Tests Positive For Coronavirus, Complicating South Korea's School Reopening Plans (Forbes) Seoul’s Nightlife Shut In Fresh COVID-19 Outbreak After Lifting Rules On ‘Distancing’ (Forbes) South Korea's Widespread Testing And Contact Tracing Lead To First Day With No New Cases (Forbes) South Korea Says Patients Who Retested Positive After Recovering Were No Longer Infectious (Forbes) Full coverage and live updates on the CoronavirusTesla has dropped the price of its cars in North America and China by up to 6% in a bid to boost sales, following a drop in demand for new cars in the midst of coronavirus lockdowns. Tesla CEO Elon Musk Tesla’s flagship Model S sedan has had thousands knocked off, now starting from $74,990, down from $79,990. Some $2,000 has been taken off its cheapest Model 3 Sedan, with a new starting price of $37,990, while its Model X SUV starts at $79,990, around $5,000 cheaper than before. Car sales were about 50% down last month compared with April 2019, according to automotive industry analysts J.D. Power. The pandemic and California's lockdown measures meant that Tesla's Fremont factory was shut down for nearly two months but reopened following a spat between Tesla CEO Elon Musk and county officials. The electric carmaker is also adjusting prices in China to around 4% lower for its imported Model S and Model X vehicles, the company announced on its Weibo page on Wednesday.

AbCellera's scientists use a variety of cutting-edge techniques to discover potentially useful ... [+] therapeutic antibodies. AbCellera announced on Wednesday that it raised that sum in a Series B funding round led by OrbiMed and DCVC Bio. The investment takes the company’s total funding to about $115 million in its eighth year of operation. “Now that we’re getting a reputation of being at the top of antibody discovery, this is an opportunity to expand our capacity, change our posture and pursue a more aggressive growth strategy,” says CEO and cofounder Carl Hansen.  Based in Vancouver, AbCellera focuses on the efficient, effective discovery of antibodies that have the potential to be used as a treatment for a variety of diseases, including cancer and neurodegeneration and infections such as influenza and Covid-19. Using microfluidic technology, which enables the automation of some basic research functions, the company is able to process samples containing potentially useful antibodies quickly, running thousands of scans at a time and analyzing them with machine learning to quickly identify the best candidates to develop into new therapies.  “We interrogate millions of immune cells and pull out the ones that have properties that are good for drugs,” says Hansen. “Then we break those cells open and sequence their DNA.” The genomic sequences of those antibodies are analyzed for its ease of manufacture. Promising ones can then be scaled up and manufactured in using different types of cells. It’s a similar process, Hansen says, to the fermentation used to make beer.  AbCellera's founding CEO Carl Hansen was originally trained in physics and engineering before opting ... [+] to move into biomedical applications. AbCellera draws its roots from research that Hansen began at the University of British Columbia in 2005, where he was focused on combining genomics, microfluidics and other methods to quickly sort through thousands of samples to discover targets for drug discovery. In 2012, he and four others cofounded AbCellera (“In a tiny little lab at UBC,” Hansen recalls), with about $725,000 in funds raised from friends and family.  Three years later, the company entered its first partnerships with pharmaceutical companies, and began to grow by leaps and bounds, according to Hansen. “We’ve been essentially doubling revenue and headcount every year,” he says. Partners now include pharmaceutical powerhouses like Lilly, Pfizer, Gilead and Novartis.  This year, the company acted quickly to develop a treatment with potential use against Covid-19. After receiving samples from patients who’d recovered from the disease in February, it took the company fewer than ten days to find promising antibody candidates, which it then presented to Lilly for consideration. The companies announced a development and manufacturing partnership on March 12, and Lilly stated in April that it expects to file an Investigational New Drug application with the FDA for the therapy by the end of May, with clinical trials to start shortly thereafter. “Our philosophy here is that we all benefit when the best science has access to the best technology.”  AbCellera had only raised $10 million from investors prior to Wednesday, consisting of a Series A round led by Data Collective in 2018. With this new $105 million round, Hansen says the company is looking to scale up its operations by hiring up to 100 new people (to add to its current workforce of about 140). It’s also looking to build a new research and development facility in Vancouver and increase manufacturing capabilities there, Hansen adds. The company has plenty of believers—the investor syndicate in this Series B round includes Presight Capital, Founders Fund, Viking Global Investors, the University of Minnesota, Eli Lilly and Co. and Peter Thiel. Antibody therapies are a fast-growing segment of the pharmaceutical industry, with a number of companies looking to develop ways to improve treatments for cancer and other diseases. AbCellara is far from the only private player to work on developing antibody therapies against Covid-19, with several clinical trials in process. AbCellera’s advantage, its CEO claims, is its combination of methods that quickly and efficiently identify effective drug targets to compress the discovery timeline. “Our philosophy here is that we all benefit when the best science has access to the best technology,” Hansen says. “I think we can elevate the whole industry if we make these investments in our capabilities and keep them open to the world.” Full coverage and live updates on the CoronavirusA Zipline drone delivers a package by parachute. The medical supplies needed to fight the pandemic already exist, they’re just unevenly distributed. Today, North Carolina healthcare company Novant Health announced a partnership with Zipline, a drone delivery company. Granted a special Part 107 waiver from the FAA, Zipline will fly delivery drones from a fulfilment center to airdrop small parcels of supplies to first one hospital, and then potentially many more throughout the state. The delivery service, which Zipline and Novant boast is “America’s first emergency drone logistics operation for hospital pandemic response,” could define how drone delivery works in the United States. It also has to account for just how small each delivery is. Apart from the person on the ground who retrieves the package, the delivery is contactless. The drone is mounted on a rail in the fulfillment center, where its two propellers spin up until a human launches the drone, which then flies to its destination. The package is released from the drone, and with a parachute descends to the ground for a human to retrieve it. It’s a clever system, one that’s delivered medical supplies throughout Rwanda for years. Up to 3.9 pounds of supplies can be loaded into a container that is almost 10 inches by 10 inches by 6 inches. For insulated flights that keep the package the same temperature in flight, a 3-pound payload can fit inside an insulated drop box with a smaller interior space. For payloads that need to be kept cool, there’s also the option for an even smaller interior compartment that can accommodate about 2 pounds of weight. That’s an impressive feat, but one where the usefulness really hinges on just how valuable a few pound of air-dropped supplies can be. In their release announcing the news, Zipline and Novant state the partnership will start with “contactless distribution of personal protective equipment and critical medical supplies.” The description suggests masks from heaven, and it’s true that a small case of N95 masks could fit in the Zipline drop box.  It is also true that countless more masks could be delivered the traditional way, by humans in box vans or through medical courier services. For drone delivery to provide enough value to offset the small payloads parachuted down below, it has to delivery something important enough to warrant the flight. Other medical supplies, everything from glass vials to test kits to collected samples to blood bags, will likely be what makes the fulfillment center really justify its drones. Blood transports surprisingly well by drone, and the right kind of blood at the right time can be life-saving enough to warrant an aerial path to a patient in need. For now, Zipline’s center in Charlotte will serve exactly one hospital, but if the route is a success and the FAA approves, the drone delivery service could expand to cover any number of hospitals within a 50 mile radius of the fulfillment center. That’s the maximum range of the drone for a round trip, and with a cruising speed of 63 mph, a loaded drone can make its drop in less than an hour and then return home. It remains to be seen how successful the first wave of deliveries will be, and if the supplies launched from the fulfillment center will be timely and useful enough to warrant the delivery method. Using a single warehouse to provide needed, if small, packages to a whole swath of the state is the ultimate ambition, one that could allow drone delivery to supplement the essential labor done by humans in the already-existing supply chains. Getting the Zipline running is the first step.

(Photo by Len Redkoles/NHLI via Getty Images) The top four teams from the league's two conferences as of the suspension of play based on points percentage will advance to the playoffs with a first round bye, and will play in a round robin tournament to determine seeding—as well as warm the players up for the return to meaningful hockey. The next 16 teams in the standings will take part in a best-of-five "play-in" series to determine the 16 playoff teams. The league traditionally holds four rounds of best-of-seven playoff series with 16 teams total, but Bettman said the first two rounds this year could be reduced to five-game series; the conference finals and Stanley Cup Final remains unchanged. The NHL's 82-game regular season was originally scheduled to conclude on April 4 but was suspended on March 12 shortly after the NBA did the same and is now officially ended. The league still needs to determine where play will take place, with Bettman saying the league wants two hub cities with 10 currently being vetted, including Chicago, Columbus, Dallas, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Minneapolis/St. Paul and Pittsburgh in the U.S. and Edmonton, Toronto and Vancouver in Canada. Training camp won't start until at least the start of July, with the league still having to determine testing and safety procedures, including the vital question of how to deal with a player contracting the virus. “This plan will produce a worthy Stanley Cup champion who will have run the post-season gauntlet that is unique to the NHL," Bettman said. The 1919 Stanley Cup Final between the Montreal Canadiens and the Seattle Metropolitans ended prematurely due to the Spanish flu. The format allows for some big market teams that were on the playoff bubble to potentially qualify. The only two teams to vote against the format were the Carolina Hurricanes and the Tampa Bay Lightning. The NBA, which has a schedule that closely mirrors the NHL and is held in the same stadiums, is still determining how to return, with Walt Disney World in Orlando being a frontrunner as a site for games. A major sports league that has returned already is the German football series Bundesliga. Canada has 88,090 confirmed cases of the coronavirus while the United States leads globally with 1,680,301.

Distancing markers will be added throughout the park and people will be separated by empty rows or seats on rides. Though the number of positive tests as a percentage of total tests is trending down, statewide cases increased 14% over the last two weeks days, according to CovidExitStrategy, a dashboard built by public health officials who served in the Obama and Trump administrations.  “Frontier City, like all Six Flags parks, is an outdoor attraction that poses a significantly lower risk of exposure than indoor venues ... Because our parks cover dozens or even hundreds of acres, we can easily manage guest throughput to achieve proper social distancing,” said Six Flags President and CEO Mike Spanos. Masks have become part of the culture wars, as some defiantly choose to go mask-free because, they say, such public health requirements infringe on their personal freedom.

"I never thought about it, but I know a lot of people are very, very badly affected, right? Unbelievable." Asked why he would take insulin, Trump had surgeon general Jerome Adams answer, as he explained to Trump that, "Your body actually makes insulin." Trump also used the event to criticize his presumptive opponent for the presidency in November, Vice President Joe Biden, saying "I hope the seniors are going to remember it because Biden is the one that put us into the jam," presumably referring to President Obama’s Affordable Care Act, though House Democrats have attempted to lower prescription drug prices, passing a bill in December 2019. Trump also claimed he would always protect Medicare and social security, despite his administration's proposed 2021 budget containing cuts to such safety net programs. "We'll always protect you on pre-existing conditions, much more so than the Democrats," Trump said, but those measures were put in place through the passing of the Affordable Care Act, the healthcare program the Republicans are currently trying again to get eliminated through the Supreme Court. "You know, if you don't take insulin, I just wrote this down, go blind, stroke, amputation, kidney failure, and other things," Trump said. Democrats are pushing for an eventual coronavirus vaccine to be affordable or outright free, with Trump's administration wavering back-and-forth in their commitments to that. Trump earlier in the month said his administration will be "looking at" making the vaccine free. In February during a hearing, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar drew criticism by saying the federal government couldn't control the cost of a potential vaccine because it needed the involvement of the private sector. The administration was quick to reverse course and claimed a vaccine would be affordable. The United States leads all countries in confirmed case of the coronavirus with 1,676,401, as well as reported deaths with 98,787 In April, Trump openly mused about injecting coronavirus patients with disinfectants, causing a wave of criticism. Companies like Lysol put out warnings over ingesting or injecting its cleaning products and government agencies additionally needed to warn against it as well. Trump later called the statements sarcastic, and the administration subsequently stopped holding daily briefings. In May, he claimed to be taking the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine prophylactically despite numerous studies and his own federal agencies warning against its use due to no noted benefits and sometimes fatal side effects.

On Tuesday, New Jersey resident Ronald Romano was arrested for a $45 million scheme to defraud and price gauge New York City, in which he tried to offload personal protective equipment that he did not possess and was not authorized to sell. Romano is just one example of an apparent increase in coronavirus related fraud that’s resulted in a 35% annual increase in complaints the SEC has recorded, according to the agency’s co-head of enforcement Steven Peikin. Two factors are driving the current surge in SEC tips, lawyers told Reuters: The sheer scale of the coronavirus crisis has led to all kinds of financial misconduct, and mass unemployment has resulted in whistleblowers who would have otherwise feared retribution from their employers. The SEC has created a new group to spot market abuses which has so far led to the agency suspending 31 penny stocks for advertising dubious coronavirus cures, tests, treatments and medical supplies. It charged two of those companies this month: Applied BioSciences Corp and Turbo Global Partners. The increase in potential fraud has also proven to be a bonanza for lawyers who help whistleblowers navigate the SEC’s bounty program (it rewards tipsters whose information leads to penalties of more than $1 million). The SEC is paying close attention to potential red flags in the disclosures issued by companies that accepted coronavirus relief funds; meanwhile, lawyers are expecting an uptick in cases related to insider trading and ponzi schemes. “Unfortunately, fraudsters often seek to exploit difficult situations like the ongoing pandemic for their own gain,” an SEC spokeswoman told Reuters. “The SEC frequently relies on the tips that we receive from the public.” “We expect to see the SEC bring more actions as we continue to investigate suspected COVID-19 related scams,” Peikin and his co-head of enforcement at the SEC, Stephanie Avakian, said in a recent statement.

[+] Senate Committee for Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions hearing on COVID-19 May 12, 2020 in Washington, D.C. Loeffler, Inhofe and Feinstein came under scrutiny after financial disclosures showed they sold off large quantities of stock before the coronavirus caused the market to crash in early March.  Authorities were investigating whether the Senators were acting on information gleaned from private briefings to avoid losing money in the downturn, which would amount to insider trading. Each has denied wrongdoing, with Loeffler saying her financial advisor was responsible for the stock sales while Feinstein said her husband made the trades. The FBI is still investigating Burr, whose cell phone was seized as part of the investigation, and who has faced more scrutiny because he was more involved in his stock trades; he’s insisted that he acted on public news reports from Asia about the virus. The Justice Department declined to comment. The offices of Inhofe and Feinstein did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  A spokesperson for Loeffler said the dropped case confirms she did nothing wrong, and said the probe was “a politically-motivated attack shamelessly promoted by the fake news media and her political opponents.” ProPublica first reported that Burr sold between $628,000 and $1.72 million worth of shares on February 13⁠, 2020—one week before the stock market plummeted⁠—and after attending private briefings on coronavirus. The development ignited a furor, and Burr was met from calls to resign by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and Fox News host Tucker Carlson. Burr asked for the Senate’s ethics committee to investigate him, stepped down as chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee and has said he does not plan to run for reelection in 2022.  Insider Trading Explained: Why Senator Burr Is Being Investigated And How Certain Stock Trades Are Illegal (Forbes) Full coverage and live updates on the CoronavirusIn New York City, the global epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic, homeowners are not putting their homes on the market: new sales inventory has hit a significant low during the months of lockdown as validated by real estate platforms Zillow, StreetEasy, local and suburban brokers and a moving company. Brownstone facades and row houses in Brooklyn Heights in New York City. New home listings on real estate platforms Zillow and StreetEasy in the New York metro area have been down by more than 70% in the weeks of the pandemic as compared to the same weeks last year. The platforms and Douglas Elliman NYC real estate agent Monica Benhuri told Forbes that rental demand remains largely unchanged from last year due to people looking to move within the city—Benhuri notes this is driven by people in their mid-to-late twenties and early 30s looking to upgrade their pads as demand by recent grads migrating to the city for employment has dropped.  Similarly, New York City-based movers TikTok Moving & Storage is experiencing 60% less business amid the coronavirus pandemic; company president Ricky Sharma told Forbes the company was doing 100-plus moves per month pre-coronavirus—now, they’re doing around 30 moves per month. Sharma said that for those who are selling their homes now, 80% of them are moving their belongings to storage units, not a final destination, showing the continued uncertainty for many city residents about where they will live in the future. New rental inventory is also down from last year on StreetEasy, though new listings and new searchers in New York increase every week, as people look for places with more work-from-home amenities like outdoor space, StreetEasy’s economist Nancy Wu told Forbes.  “In the sales market people are taking a wait-and-see approach,” said Wu. “The big picture is: We haven’t seen much evidence that people are looking to leave the city permanently.” Likewise, Frank Pignataro, agent and co-owner at Sailing Home Realty, which serves Long Island, told Forbes he has yet to see an increase in demand from NYC buyers looking to relocate to the suburbs.  On the other hand, New York City brokers are seeing foreign investors looking to park their cash in real estate and take advantage of the distress, Benhuri told Forbes. Wu also notes that there has been no short-term change in prices of New York dwellings for sale or rent, but notes there may be fluctuation within a year, this is what happened with the city’s real estate market after the Great Recession and 9/11.  “Like after 9/11 or the Great Recession, people will leave the city for a few months and then come back as the city bounces back,” said Wu. “There’s something about the urban preference. It’s really hard to make the tradeoff for a life in the suburbs when you’re used to this urban environment.”  Daniel Norber, president of New York-based moving company Imperial Moving, told Forbes that business is booming with the coronavirus pandemic. In March, it was driven by students who fled from their dorms and apartments, hiring the moving company to pack their stuff via FaceTime and send it back to their parents’ homes in the suburbs. Now, the company’s business is shifting to families and older adults making moves from the city to sunnier provinces, with Florida and Georgia as the most popular destinations. “People are just trying to get out of the city,” said Norber.  There has been much buzz in the media around New Yorkers vacating city dwellings in favor of suburban life. At the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, this led to significant backlash from second-home and vacation town residents, who worried that the New Yorkers bring coronavirus with them. And it turns out, many did. However, the data from StreetEasy and Zillow complicates stories like this one that says more people are fleeing New York for permanent new homes elsewhere, which may be true, but it is not the case for most homeowners.

Last week, another biotech company, Moderna, reported positive results from its vaccine trial. In total, there are 10 vaccines currently in clinical trials and another 114 in preclinical evaluation, according to a tally from Fundstrat. Economic data released Tuesday helped boost market confidence: Consumer confidence jumped by more than expected to 86.6 this month, up from 85.7 in April, while new home sales last month also topped estimates. Progress is also being made on the reopening front, lifting markets higher as several states start to lift lockdowns and allow businesses to resume.

Both hedge funds and mutual funds have been steadily buying up health care stocks at record levels, primarily investing in biotech companies and pharmaceuticals; with the market still rebounding from its crisis-level low in late March, healthcare stocks have soared as investors bet on a coronavirus vaccine. Hedge funds and mutual funds disagree on key areas, however: Energy and Financials, the two-worst performing sectors so far this year. Hedge funds were overweight on energy stocks in the first quarter as mutual funds trimmed their holdings in those sectors; mutual funds are mostly overweight in the financial sector while the opposite held true for hedge funds. There are 13 stocks that are “shared favorites” among both hedge funds and mutual funds: Adobe, Bank of America, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Citigroup, Crown Holdings, Comcast, Salesforce, Google parent Alphabet, Mastercard, ServiceNow, PayPal, UnitedHealth Group and Visa.  Among the big tech “FAAMG” companies, only Google parent Alphabet is a shared favorite, Goldman’s research showed; Amazon, Microsoft and Facebook are some of the most popular stocks for hedge funds, but they’re among the 10 most underweight positions for large-cap mutual funds. There is also some divergence on the current market outlook: While hedge funds carried more leverage into the bear market and made riskier investments, mutual funds grew their cash piles. Cash as a share of assets rose from 2.1% in December to 2.7% in March—the highest allocation since November 2018, according to Goldman’s research. Hedge funds and mutual funds are also split on an age-old investing debate: growth vs. value stocks. With growth stocks continuing to outperform this year, hedge funds have shifted away from value stocks, the latest data shows, whereas mutual funds are still more likely to be overweight in value over growth stocks. With Wall Street growing more optimistic about a successful reopening of the economy and a potential coronavirus vaccine, the S&P 500 on Tuesday broke above the 3,000 level for the first time since early March.

   (Forbes) Full coverage and live updates on the CoronavirusGlenn Fine, the acting inspector general at the Pentagon who was supposed to oversee how the Trump administration was administering coronavirus relief funds, resigned on Tuesday after Trump effectively removed him from the role, one of a string of actions by the White House to purge independent watchdogs tasked with investigating the administration. Glenn Fine, acting Inspector General at the U.S. Department of Defense, testifies during a Senate ... [+] Judiciary Committee hearing concerning firearm accessory regulation and enforcing federal and state reporting to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) on Capitol Hill, December 6, 2017 in Washington, DC. Fine was the acting Defense Department Inspector General until Trump demoted him to his prior role of deputy IG in early April, disqualifying him from serving on a panel of inspectors general meant to keep tabs on coronavirus spending.  CNN reported that Fine was not told to resign and did so on his own accord. Trump has removed three other inspectors generals involved in high-profile investigations of his administration in recent months. Fine did not name Trump specifically, but in a statement emphasized the importance of inspectors general. “The role of inspectors general is a strength of our system of government. They provide independent oversight to help improve government operations in a transparent way.  They are a vital component of our system of checks and balances, and I am grateful to have been part of that system.” Democrats criticized Fine’s demotion in April, claiming Trump was abusing his power to go after watchdogs meant to hold his administration accountable. In a statement to CNN, former Defense Secretary James Mattis said Fine’s resignation was “regrettable.” "It's regrettable seeing such a highly competent, non-partisan patriot and public servant leaving government service. Mr. Glenn Fine represents all that is noble in taking on the hard work of keeping government honest and responsive. He will be missed," Mattis said. Earlier this month Trump fired State Department inspector general Steve Linick, soon after he reportedly opened an investigation into Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. In early April, Trump fired intelligence community's inspector general Michael Atkinson—who's forwarding of a whistleblower complaint to Congress sparked the president's impeachment proceedings. And on May 1, Trump removed acting Health and Human Services inspector general Christi Grimm, who released a report finding hospitals were in "severe" need of testing supplies and personal protective equipment. Trump Continues Post-Impeachment Purge: Fourth Inspector General Gets The Axe (Forbes) Full coverage and live updates on the CoronavirusNobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman speaks at the Challenges of Job-Rich and Inclusive Growth ... [+] - Session 2: Public debt, public investment, and growth talk at George Washington University in Washington,DC on October 8, 2014 at the start of the annual IMF/World Bank meetings. AFP PHOTO/Nicholas KAMM (Photo credit should read NICHOLAS KAMM/AFP via Getty Images) As several countries and some U.S. states tiptoe into “reopening the economy” ― as the popular expression goes ― epidemiologists have looked on, some with trepidation, others with dismay.  Governments are faced with a punishing Sophie’s Choice: Do you risk the safety and possibility of sacrificing more lives or do you sacrifice the health of the economy? Reopen the economy too soon and you risk triggering a new wave of infections and possible deaths. Keep the economy shut for too long in hopes of squashing transmission and you infect the economy with its own variety of serious illness.  The economy, like a person, can get sick. What we don’t know is just how long and how severe it will suffer.  McKinsey sought to answer this question in a report outlining numerous recovery scenarios, as Andrew Ross Sorkin covered in DealBook back in early April, “McKinsey has laid out nine recovery scenarios with a letter spaghetti of V’s, U’s, L’s, W’s and other unidentifiable squiggles.” The public has since (what else is there to do?) become well-versed with these Spaghettio Squiggles of graphs. For a while, there seemed to be bubbling hope for a quick-and-easy V-shaped recovery, where we bounce right back. The enduring lockdown has, unfortunately, been our wet blanket, dimming that hope with every passing day.  Reflecting the hope that recedes in the minds of many, Sorkin writes: “A ‘V-shaped’ recovery looks unlikely, according to most economists. The number crunchers at Berenberg think that it will take two years just to make up the ground lost after a steep plunge in the first half of 2020. A recent Deutsche Bank analysis looking ‘beyond the abyss’ reckons that, compared with pre-virus trend growth, the U.S. and European economies will be $2 trillion smaller by year end, and still $1 trillion smaller at the end of 2021.” As a child of the Great Recession, the V-shaped recovery was never on my mind. The threat of its much more ominous L-shaped sibling loomed much larger, a scenario where the economy wouldn’t recover, but would suffer long-lasting symptoms, forever maimed by the unexpected external shock of a pandemic that appeared to sideswipe the world.  Will We Recover From The Unemployment Spike? The meteoric rise in unemployment has been a big cause for concern. In the United States, unemployment is teetering today around 15%. Some even speculate that it could be hovering closer to 20%, levels dangerously comparable to those of the Great Depression.  But even the Great Recession of 2008 wasn’t so long ago that the lingering psychological effects of joblessness make many ask can we come back from this and if so, when? Just today, reports by economists cited in the New York Times estimate that “42 percent of recent layoffs will result in permanent job loss.”  But I am of a different opinion. In his newsletter in mid May, Paul Krugman looked at indexed employment growth in recoveries. The emerging graph showed two types of recoveries.  “What you see is that before 1990 we tended to have ‘morning in America’ recoveries, in which jobs came soaring back. Since then, however, we’ve had extended ‘jobless recoveries,’ in which G.D.P. is growing but it takes a long time for the jobs to come back...[F]ast recoveries followed recessions caused by high interest rates, imposed by the Federal Reserve to curb inflation; once the Fed relented, the economy easily sprang back. Later recessions have been caused, instead, by private-sector overreach: the commercial real estate bubble of the 1980s, the tech bubble of the 1990s. These were much harder to cure... “Covid-19 is, in some ways, like the spike in interest rates that generated the 1981-1982 recession. It’s something imposed on the economy from outside, as it were, rather than the result of private-sector excess, so you’d expect fast recovery once the outside shock recedes.”   The takeaway according to Krugman, an argument I agree with, is we will see a recovery. We won’t be branded this time around with a dreaded ‘L’. Or at least there’s a good chance we won’t...if we put the right policies in place.  But, of course, there is no guarantee. With the stunning lack of leadership in setting an effective response strategy, most notably in the United States, it leaves an uncomfortable amount of room for the recovery to still go astray.  “One can’t exclude the possibility of a ‘black swan of black swans’: structural damage to the economy, caused by a yearlong spread of the virus until a vaccine is widely available, combined with the lack of policy response to prevent widescale bankruptcies, unemployment, and a financial crisis,” according to McKinsey’s report. An effective strategy is critical for recovery, but what?  A Strategy For Reopening And this is where we bring back the epidemiologists as the protagonists of the story. The storyline dominating the headlines to date has been pitting economists against epidemiologists, as if the only strategies available to us are either to reopen the economy in its entirety or stay inside indefinitely.  But the countries that have kickstarted a reopening strategy, countries like Australia, Germany, and Denmark, have played somewhere in the middle. They didn’t swing the door wide open, they left the door ajar, allowing schools and small children to first wiggle their way through, leaving the door ever so slightly open for the next wave of small businesses.  Phased reopenings are in large part made possible by the measures put in place to prevent ―  and if needed mitigate ― future outbreaks: consistent measures of rate of transmission, capacity limitations on office and retail spaces, enforced usage of masks in some cases, temperature checks, etc. The measures are by no means perfect, but cumulatively effective.  Figuring out how we’re going to make it from here until we have a vaccine is an overwhelming prospect. But figuring out how to make marginal improvements to make it from here to tomorrow is all we might need.  There is a classic writing adage from E.L. Doctorow: “Writing is like driving at night in the fog. You can only see as far as your headlights, but you can make the whole trip that way.”  So too, I would argue, with an effective strategy to reopen the economy. We may never know enough to develop a strategy which we know will work. We’ll likely stay in the dark until the vaccine arrives. But that doesn’t mean we have to remain idle for the foreseeable future.  That seems to be the bet some governments are making. Time will be the only arbiter to decide if they are right. Full coverage and live updates on the CoronavirusDolphins owner Stephen Ross didn't hesitate to declare the NFL will definitely play games this year. ... [+] (Photo by Mark Brown/Getty Images) Dolphins owner Stephen Ross is the first pro sports executive to publicly guarantee games will resume this year amidst the coronavirus pandemic. While the health risks remain immense, and could only intensify with an expected second wave of the virus in the fall, there is far too much money at stake to shut down until 2021. We should all operate under the assumption sports will be back, no matter how convoluted or difficult the task may seem.  In an interview Tuesday with CNBC, Ross said he thinks there will “definitely be football this year,” adding the only question is whether there will be “fans in the stadium.” The NFL has operated virtually this offseason, successfully pulling of free agency and its most-watched draft ever. Teams were permitted last week to start gradually reopening their facilities for select employees.  Of course, safely resuming practices and games is a far more difficult endeavor than holding the NFL Draft remotely. On March 11, Jazz center Rudy Gobert’s positive coronavirus test shut down the NBA, and eventually all sports. Gobert was asymptomatic and infected at least one teammate, point guard Donovan Mitchell.  At least eight other NBA players tested positive for COVID-19.  While it was originally thought one positive test would force an entire team to quarantine, it’s possible a single positive test might not even stop a game, the Wall Street Journal says. The NFL’s chief medical officer acknowledged last week its inevitable players and personnel will contract the virus. The question is, how will the league handle it?  As scientists begin to uncover more information about the coronavirus, it’s apparent it poses the greatest risk to the elderly and immunocompromised. New data from Massachusetts, the fifth hardest-hit state in the country, shows the average age of death in confirmed COVID-19 cases is 82. Only 84 people between the ages of 18 and 49 have passed away in confirmed cases.  While some coaches and executives find themselves in “high-risk” groups, the vast majority of players do not. It's likely pro sports leagues will continue to lean on that data as they negotiate their returns with each respective players’ union.  The politics around sports returning are beginning to change as well. While the White House has always pushed for leagues to resume as soon as possible — and in front of fans — Democratic governors presiding over coronavirus hotspots now sound more optimistic about the possibility of practices and games being held in their states. California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who previously said it’s “difficult to imagine” sports being played in front of fans without a vaccine, now says he thinks pro sports could resume activities without fans by early June. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has already cleared sports teams to return to their facilities in his state, even though New York City remains the epicenter of the crisis.  Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has already declared his state will be willing to work with any sports league that wants to resume operations.  Leagues stand to lose significant revenue if they play without fans. SportsMoney colleague Mike Ozanian estimates the NFL will lose a staggering $5.5 billion, and MLB owners claim they would lose $4 billion in revenue. But at least playing without fans would allow leagues to recoup TV revenue, and all indications are people will tune in. A staggering 5.8 million people on average viewed  “The Match” Sunday, watching Tom Brady drive golf balls into the woods and Phil Mickelson deliver long-winded soliloquies about several of his shots to nobody in particular. A sports-starved nation desperately wants to see its beloved games return, even if they take the form of a charity celebrity golf match in Hobe Sound, Fla. played without spectators.  Make no mistake: the match that pitted Tiger Woods and Peyton Manning against Mickelson and Brady was an enjoyable, if not a little too long, multi-hour affair. But more than anything, its ratings success once again shows just how desperately sports fans want something new to watch. They also tuned into “The Last Dance” in droves, with an average of 5.6 million people watching each episode of ESPN’s 10-part series on Michael Jordan’s historic run with the Chicago Bulls.  MLB is sending a new proposal to players Tuesday on starting the season, and on Monday, the NHL submitted a plan outlining its possible return. The NBA doesn’t have an official proposal yet, but has started discussing plans to restart its paused season in late July at Disney’s ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex in Florida, the league says. The amount of planning needed to play live sports in the midst of a pandemic in the world’s hardest-hit country is downright daunting. Any moment now, the U.S. is expected to surpass the total of 100,000 COVID-19 deaths, greater than the number of American casualties suffered in the Korean, Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan wars combined.  But with nearly 40 million Americans filing for unemployment over the last two months, states are reopening their economies, even as some states see rises in COVID-19 hospitalizations. Pro sports leagues will be part of the “new normal.” Ross is just the first person to outwardly say it. Full coverage and live updates on the CoronavirusDr. Matthew Binnicker, an expert in the diagnosis of infectious disease, explains why the increasing testing for antibodies against the virus the causes Covid-19 is important, but not a silver bullet in re-opening the economy. The development of rapid antibody tests like this one is important but they can't be the only tool ... [+] in the public health arsenal. As the world continues to grapple with the Covid-19 pandemic, one of the greatest challenges we face is the unknown. Although we continue to learn more about the virus and disease each day, important questions remain, such as ‘When will we know it’s safe to return to normal life?’ It’s during these moments when facts, logic and scientific reason are more important than ever. There is no better time to rely on what we know rather than attempting to fill the void with what we don’t know. Testing has received a significant amount of attention in recent weeks, with plans being formulated to use testing to safely reopen the economy. However, there are important limitations, which need to be considered as we develop this strategy. One type of test that has generated much discussion is serology, which detects antibodies that have been developed following an infection with SARS-CoV-2.  Nations are discussing how serology can be used to allow citizens to safely emerge from the Covid-19 pandemic, and some are considering ‘immunity passports’, which would allow those testing positive for antibodies to be exempt from physical restrictions (i.e., social distancing), and therefore, return to work, school or participate in other social events.  This concept relies on several assumptions, including the perception that all serology tests are 100% accurate, and that detection of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 implies long-lasting immunity against reinfection. But many of these assumptions don’t reflect the reality of what we know about Covid-19 so far. Antibody tests aren’t perfect Antibody tests are important but they also have important limitations. Unfortunately, antibody tests are not 100% specific, meaning they can yield false-positive results. We know this from decades of experience with serology tests for various infectious diseases, and documented false-positive antibody results, especially among those with autoimmune conditions or women who are pregnant.  You might ask, if antibody tests can provide high specificity (e.g., >98%) - isn’t that good enough? The answer’s not quite so simple. The accuracy of any test, including serology, depends not only on the test itself, but on something called the disease prevalence, which is the number of cases of the disease in a population (e.g., a city) at a given point in time.  In other words, if a serology test with 98% specificity is used to test a community with a COVID-19 prevalence of ≥20% (e.g., New York City), then the results are going to be fairly reliable. However, if the same test is used in an area with a low disease prevalence, let’s say <2%, then almost every positive would be a false-positive result. This is important, as we don’t want people thinking their “immune” when they’re really not. Antibodies against coronaviruses don’t offer life-long immunity Understandably, many are hoping that if they test positive for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, that they will be protected from any future infection. However, past experience with other coronaviruses, including those causing the ‘common cold’, has shown us that the immunity conferred by infection is not life-long. Four common serotypes of coronavirus (i.e., serotypes OC43, 229E, NL63 and HKU1) circulate in the population and cause annual epidemics of mild respiratory illness. We can experience multiple bouts of the common cold because the immune response to these coronaviruses is relatively short-lived, often in the range of several years.  Similarly, data gathered following the SARS and MERS outbreaks showed a decline in antibody levels after 2 years, and suggested that patients may be susceptible to reinfection 3 years after their initial exposure. Based on this past experience, we have no reason to assume that infection with SARS-CoV-2 will produce life-long immunity. Not all antibodies are created equal Finally, it’s important to emphasize that not all antibodies function to prevent infection or provide immunity. Certain antibodies, called neutralizing antibodies, are required to prevent a virus, like SARS-CoV-2, from infecting other cells. Other antibodies may simply bind to a virus and flag it as a foreign invader, with the hope that other immune cells will clear the pathogen. Although these binding antibodies may cause a COVID-19 antibody test to be positive, their presence does not always correlate with protection from reinfection or prolonged immunity. Despite these limitations and important considerations, serologic testing will play an important role determining the seroprevalence of COVID-19 in the population, identifying those who are candidates to donate blood for convalescent plasma therapy, and measuring the effectiveness of future COVID-19 vaccines. But it is not a foolproof tool in reopening the economy. Full coverage and live updates on the CoronavirusThe American flag is draped over the Green Monster on Memorial Day as the Major League Baseball ... [+] season is postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic on May 25, 2020, at Fenway Park in Boston.  MLB owners and players may meet as early as today to discuss, among other things, how the players will be compensated should the season begin in early July without fans attending the games.  The owners’ original proposal in mid-May was for the owners and the players to split revenue evenly. The players’ union is against that idea, saying the 50-50 split would amount to a salary cap. The players are also skeptical about the figures the owners presented to the union and want to see their books so they can see for themselves how the numbers were derived. In addition, the players’ union said it had a deal with owners in March for the players to be paid on a prorated basis for an abbreviated season—which, as I wrote, is not true. Bottom line: Even with an even revenue split, the owners are going to lose about $1 billion. Paying the players their prorated salaries would result in an operating loss of about $1.5 billion. Below, I break down our MLB numbers for the 2019 season. The numbers look at cash in versus cash out, not accrual accounting. Thus, they include the money MLB will get from the networks in 2020 but not the rebates baseball will give them in the out years for a shortened 2020 season.  From a national television perspective, the bulk of the revenues come from the playoffs and the World Series. While about half of the regular season’s nationally televised games of the week on ESPN, Fox, FS1 and TBS could be lost, all of the networks (other than ESPN) are in it mainly for the playoffs. The potential combination of an expanded playoff format along with expanded digital rights from BAM should permit MLB to retain about 80% to 85% of its 2020 national television revenues. The MLB Network will take a hit as well, probably in terms of an extended term to cover the months without live baseball. The teams will face more of a financial challenge on the regional media front. Based on an 82-game schedule, the RSNs will lose approximately half of their regular-season baseball games and most likely will be able to access few, if any, of the expanded playoff games. While ratings may very well go up, many ad sales categories have been sidelined, so you can’t expect that these games will be more profitable to RSNs than before the pandemic. Moreover, the RSNs, particularly those owned by Sinclair, are under financial stress after months without live games, so the networks may be pushing for a proportionate reduction in rights fee payments to cover the missed games, ameliorated somewhat by extended terms, additional digital rights and expanded marketing opportunities. Bottom line, expect that team regional media revenues will be reduced by about 40% to 45%. Figure about the same for radio—a declining category for sports overall, but still an important one for local baseball. For the figures below, national revenue includes equally shared revenue from national media contracts, sponsorships and licensing. Local media includes television and radio. Sponsorships are stadium ad signage, pouring rights and naming rights. Other stadium revenue captures money from concessions, team stores, parking and non-MLB revenue like concerts. Operating expenses are in three buckets: player costs (salary, bonuses, pensions, benefits), team costs (stadium operations, SG&A, coaches, travel, scouting and minor leagues, league expenses) and stadium debt service (money paid by team owners from stadium revenue, like PILOT bonds). Here are the figures for the full 2019 season.     Operating Profit (Ebitda): $1.5 billion The owners are proposing an 82-game regular season with an expanded playoff format that would send seven teams to the playoffs per league. Holding revenue and expenses constant in 2019 dollars, here’s how revenue and expenses would shake out under that scenario.     Operating Loss (Ebitda): $1.5 billion Here’s a look at the P&L if revenue were split 50-50 between owners and players.     Operating Loss (Ebitda): $1.1 billion Yes, TV deals generally increase 3% to 5% a year, so our 2019 figures are likely a bit low. But even if you were to adjust for the increase in media revenue, MLB’s 30 teams would lose about $1 billion if player salaries amounted to 50% of revenue in an 82-game schedule.

[+] Financial Center May 8, 2008 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. One hundred and thirty million households are eligible to receive a tax rebate check under the $168 billion economic stimulus plan. (Photo by Jeff Fusco/Getty Images) The Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service have announced that they have distributed more than 152 million Economic Impact Payments, sometimes referred to as stimulus checks. The payments total nearly $258 billion, with an average payment of $1,695 (that's roughly the value of a check for a single adult and a child). "Economic Impact Payments have continued going out at a rapid rate to Americans across the country," said IRS Commissioner Chuck Rettig. "We remind people to visit IRS.gov for the latest information, including answers to the most common questions we see surrounding the payments. We also continue to urge those who don't normally have a filing requirement, including those with little or no income, that they can quickly register for the payments on IRS.gov." Included in the announcement were updated state-by-state figures. Not surprisingly, California received the most payments (16,869,636): it is the largest state by population. The top five states to receive payments followed population trends with Texas, Florida, New York, and Pennsylvania in line behind the Golden State. KPE On the other end of the spectrum, states also mostly followed population trends with Wyoming, the District of Columbia, Vermont, Alaska, and North Dakota receiving the least amount of checks. KPE You can see how all of the states fared here: KPE If that’s tough to read, you can view it on Scribd (or click the link at the top for the IRS announcement). Utah taxpayers received the most money per check ($1,938), followed by Idaho ($1,872), South Dakota ($1,821), Nebraska ($1,815), and Wyoming ($1,806). District of Columbia taxpayers received the least money per check ($1,368) followed by Massachusetts ($1,603), New York ($1,609), Rhode Island, ($1,622) and Maryland ($1,627). My guess is that many of those in high-density areas, like D.C. and New York, were likely phased out of the higher checks. Phaseouts are based on adjusted gross income (AGI), but AGI does not reflect the cost of living, nor taxable income (it's your income before your standard or itemized deductions).  Here's how that would impact checks. It costs an estimated 52% more to live in D.C. than in Cheyenne, Wyoming. That tends to explain higher salaries (to make up for the cost of living) in areas like D.C. But, stimulus checks do not reflect any adjustments for the cost of living.  The amount of the payment phases out for those earning more than $75,000 ($150,000 for joint returns and $112,500 for heads of household). Phaseout means that the benefit goes down as income goes up. (You can see an example here.) To put that into context, an income of $75,000 in Cheyenne is roughly equivalent to $114,000 in D.C. With respect to stimulus payments, the Cheyenne resident would receive the full $1,200 payment for a single adult, while the D.C. resident would receive nothing.  An income of $65,000 in Cheyenne is about the same as $98,800 in D.C. At those numbers, the Cheyenne resident would receive the full $1,200 payment for a single adult, while the D.C. resident would receive $10. The checks were sent out to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. As of today, Johns Hopkins University puts the total number of U.S. cases at 1,662,768, with 98,223 deaths. By total numbers, the states which have been most impacted by the pandemic are New York, New Jersey, Illinois, Massachusetts and California. The IRS plans to continue to send out payments throughout the year. Payments are automatic for people who filed a tax return in 2018 or 2019, receive Social Security retirement, survivor or disability benefits (SSDI), Railroad Retirement benefits, as well as Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and Veterans Affairs beneficiaries who didn't file a tax return in the last two years. For those who don't receive federal benefits and didn't have a filing obligation in 2018 or 2019, visit the Non-Filer tool at IRS.gov to register.

Ingested in a capsule into the gut, Stabilitech's potential oral vaccine aims to prompt an immune response in mucosal cells in the respiratory system and elsewhere in the body. The firm believes that will be more effective in tackling respiratory illnesses like coronavirus. The British government is touting the country as a global leader in the big-money investment race to find a vaccine for COVID-19. (Photo by BEN STANSALL / AFP) / TO GO WITH AFP STORY BY JOE JACKSON (Photo by BEN STANSALL/AFP via Getty Images) Last Friday, amidst all the heat, hype, and big bucks that greeted even the most modest advances in Covid-19 vaccine development in the United States, a far more sober assessment came from our friends across the pond: “Why We May Not Get a Coronavirus Vaccine.” Evidently British restraint, coupled with Boris Johnson's tangle with Covid, has infused a dose of reality into the country’s expectations of what a Covid vaccine might and might not do. This is a reality check for which the American government is long overdue. To repeat my own warnings on the subject, the question we must reckon with is not when, but if we will find a Covid vaccine that is safe and effective for everyone. If we acknowledge the reality that the vaccines currently being tested might fail or protect only some of us, what policy choices can our lawmakers enact now that will ensure our protection no matter the outcome? If all vaccines fail, the answer is clear. Use what we know works to radically reduce infection in our populations. Identify those infected, symptomatically or via testing; identify those exposed through rigorous contract tracing; and mandate a period of 14-day controlled isolation for all those exposed. Then, continue the policy indefinitely to prevent re-occurrence during the pandemic. East Asian countries proved that is the best way to drive the infection rate to zero or near zero. We should all remember the entire pandemic began as a single infection in a faraway country. A single infection at home, absent a vaccine, could restart this terrible cycle. If the vaccine completely protects only the young and healthy, again, the answer is clear. Vaccinate everyone, without regard to age, economic income, or geography. Urge caution for the elderly and anyone else who may not respond because of preexisting medical conditions. Understanding that the danger of a renewed epidemic is real, continue the policy of identification, contact tracing and mandatory isolation. If the vaccine partially protects the young and not the elderly, then we will be facing the most likely outcome. Current vaccines may protect the young from dying of lung disease but may not prevent nasal infections and possibly other complications. They may still transmit the virus. The most vulnerable populations will remain at high risk of dying. In that case, we will have no recourse other than to maintain a high level of vigilance and infection control via detection, contract tracing, and isolation.  There is a very real possibility that we will develop effective anti-viral drugs that both cure those ill and prevent infection of those exposed. I recently wrote about the 100 Million Healthy Lives program in Egypt. Over the course of one year, everyone in the country 12 years and older—a total of 65 million people—was screened for hepatitis C infection, a silent condition. Those with active viremia were treated and cured. Hepatitis C is now eliminated from Egypt. The cost was modest, less than $250 million for the entire program. That is a future we can look forward to if we are fortunate enough to have the drugs to do the job. Even so, until Covid is gone from the face of the earth, the policy of identify, trace and isolate must remain. Creating sound public policy in the face of uncertainty is difficult, but that it is the job of government. Governments exist to protect us all. Let’s hope that they are up to the challenge.

(Photo by Tayfun Coskun/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images) The NYSE trading floor is reopening with a number of changes that accommodate social distancing, including barriers to keep people at a safe distance from one another. Just 25% of traders will be allowed to return to the floor, and will be screened and have their temperature taken on entry into the building. They are also not allowed to take public transport to work, and must wear masks. Traders must also sign a liability waiver to stop them suing the NYSE if they catch coronavirus, according to the Wall Street Journal, and recognise the risk that they face by returning to the floor. Opening bell events are also on hold. The NYSE is one of the few to still operate trading floors and electronic trading. Stacey Cunningham, NYSE President, said in a statement: “Today, May 26, marks the reopening of the NYSE trading floor, following its temporary closure two months ago in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic.  “This moment comes as we begin working together across America to restart our economy. We are starting cautiously, with new safety measures to limit the strain on the health-care system and the risk to those who work beneath our roof.” The NYSE closed for the first time in eight years on March 23, switching to electronic trading as the pandemic took hold in the U.S. It was last closed in the midst of Hurricane Sandy in October 2012. The reopening comes as several states across the U.S. continue to ease lockdown measures and reopen non-essential businesses in a bid to restart the economy.

  isn’t the only company releasing new content during the pandemic. A digital series connecting superfans with their favorite young adult authors will premiere on Facebook Watch and Instagram on May 31, 2020, proving the show can go on—on the right platform.  The show, called Letters to ___, was created by production house Picturestart and is the one-year-old company’s first release.

 , Endeavor and more, the company is one to keep an eye on in the young adult space, thanks to upcoming projects like a prequel to Grease and a film adaption of bestseller Eleanor & Park. What originally was going to be filmed inside a studio in Los Angeles—with popular writers like R.L. Stine of Goosebumps, Stephenie Meyer of Twilight and Veronica Roth of Divergent surprising fans in person—quickly moved to Zoom and FaceTime. The show went from being tabled in March to wrapping up production in mid-May.  Letters to ___ isn’t the first program to pivot during the pandemic, but it is seemingly better suited for it. Preexisting shows that decided to film from home, such as American Idol, Saturday Night Live and The Voice, saw strong ratings when they returned to TV screens, but the novelty quickly wore off. Viewership for Idol and The Voice dropped to their lowest levels of the season, despite audiences having more time than ever to consume content. Blame the fact that they were trying to adapt their set programs to a new normal—and still fill an hour or more.  Letters to ___ , on the other hand, had the chance to think digital-first. But that doesn’t mean it’s being put together haphazardly at home; it will all be edited by digital media company Brat TV. “We liked the idea of feeling immediate but didn’t want it to seem like a DIY, cobbled-together show,” says Picturestart CEO Erik Feig, who oversaw the Hunger Games, Divergent and Twilight film series. “In terms of high-end production value . . . the premium content does dry up during” the pandemic. Episodes only run six to seven minutes long. And its target audience—the young adult fans—is used to consuming content through social media. More than one third of Instagram users, for example, are under the age of 24.   The revamped show also fits perfectly within Facebook Watch’s new strategy. The platform, which has 140 million daily users and a 2020 content budget of about $1.4 billion according to The Information, decided to move away from scripted content earlier this year in favor of short-form talk shows, like its flagship series Red Table Talk hosted by Jada Pinkett Smith and Nine Months with Courtney Cox. Those series have both experienced a surge of viewers during the pandemic, with a coronavirus-themed episode of Red Table Talk garnering over 113 million views. For Picturestart, which has the rights to the IP, the series sets up a slew of upcoming releases. It has an adaptation of R.L. Stine’s Point Horror books in the works for HBO Max, a film based on Veronica Roth’s newly released book, Chosen Ones, in production and an unannounced project with Stephenie Meyer coming up. (The only writer featured on the show that Picturestart doesn’t have a deal with is Ann M. Martin of The Baby-Sitters Club.) The series also serves as easy marketing.  “Because books have a really long life . . . they can be discovered over and over again, and the things you do to support and promote a book last a long time,” says Roth, who has been on a digital book tour since April. “I feel it, too, the desire to connect with people in a meaningful way, beyond watching them on Instagram making sourdough starter.” Full coverage and live updates on the CoronavirusNew Jersey-based pharmaceutical Merck announced three initiatives Tuesday to fight the novel coronavirus, including teaming up with nonprofit scientific research firm IAVI to develop a vaccine, as companies around the world race to find an effective treatment against the virus. A Merck employee at the company's German laboratory.  Merck and IAVI’s potential coronavirus vaccine will use the same technology that is in Merck’s Ebola Zaire virus vaccine, known as recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV). The rVSV vaccine uses a weakened strain of the virus to generate an immune response in the recipient. Merck also said it is acquiring Themis, a company that focuses on vaccines and immune modulation therapies for infectious diseases and cancer and is working on a Covid-19 vaccine that uses a weakened strain of the measles virus. In addition to the two vaccine efforts, Merck is collaborating with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics to create an oral antiviral treatment for the virus. Clinical studies for the two vaccines are expected to start later in 2020, according to press statements. Shares of Merck jumped over 4% before the morning bell. “COVID-19 is a global challenge and requires global solutions,” said Merck chairman and chief executive Kenneth C. Frazier in a statement. “Merck intends to make any vaccine or medicine we develop for this pandemic broadly accessible and affordable globally, and we are working now to accomplish this goal as quickly as possible.” One. That’s the number of doses Merck is ultimately aiming for in either Covid-19 vaccine. Roger Perlmutter, the head of Merck’s Research Laboratories, told Stat News that having to give booster shots would make immunizing people more difficult. According to Stat News, Merck’s efforts against Covid-19 have been going on behind the scenes for at least two and a half months prior to its announcements Tuesday. In that space of time, other companies—including Pfizer, Moderna and Novavax—have announced their efforts to create a vaccine, and are in varying stages of development. Although the World Health Organization says over 100 vaccines are in the works, with some promising early trial results, experts like National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director Dr. Anthony Fauci have expressed caution. 12 to 18 months is the timeline in which most health officials agree a safe vaccine could be made available.

(Paul Chinn/The San Francisco Chronicle via Getty Images) Business owners have had a wild ride lately, learning to live with lower revenues, adapting to new contact-less business practices and deciphering what one person called a “rat’s nest” of business stimulus.  Uncertainty and anxiety persists, and lots of entrepreneurs have questions. I’ve compiled a list of the ones I’m asked most frequently to help all of you who may have similar concerns. As always, I’m working with the information we have right now, including the two new Interim Final Rules (IFR) on Forgiveness and Loan Review Procedures published on May 22nd.  I’m not the SBA, your lender or your advisor, but I hope you find this information helpful.  The Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) How do I pay myself if I’m a sole proprietor in order to maximize the forgiveness? Sole proprietors are not employees, so the pay period doesn’t apply. Your compensation forgiveness is determined by your 2019 tax return: line 31 on the 2019 schedule C/52 *8. The forgiveness amount is capped at $15,385. In addition, the SBA has not requested any additional income verification on its sample application.  However, your eligible non-payroll costs – business mortgage interest, rent and utilities – are based on payments incurred or paid during the eight-week forgiveness period and do need to be verified.   My husband and I own an LLC together. Are we counted as 1 employee or 2 employees when applying for forgiveness?   As an owner of the company, you are not an employee at all. For purposes of loan forgiveness, your compensation is listed on Line 9 of Schedule A. If there is more than one owner, you need to provide a list of each owner and his/her/their compensation.  Each owner’s compensation is limited to $15,385.  The forgiveness application says the utility payments include transportation expenses, but I took the standard mileage rate last year. Do I include that figure from my 2019 return?  For non-payroll expenses, you can only use costs that were paid or incurred during your eight-week covered period. So, you need to look at the expenses you had during that period and only claim those. And while “transportation” isn’t defined, I go back to the IFR from April 14th that says you had to claim or be able to claim these expenses on your schedule C. To me, that implies counting your mileage would be good here.   What does paid or incurred mean?  For PPP purposes, paid means any of those payments actually made during your eight-week covered period. Incurred means any bill that has accrued during the period but that may be paid in the next billing cycle, which might fall outside of the eight-week covered period. Here is the example used in the most recent IFR on forgiveness .  “A borrower’s covered period begins on June 1 and ends on July 26. The borrower pays its May and June electricity bill during the covered period and pays its July electricity bill on August 10, which is the next regular billing date. The borrower may seek loan forgiveness for its May and June electricity bills, because they were paid during the covered period. In addition, the borrower may seek loan forgiveness for the portion of its July electricity bill through July 26 (the end of the covered period), because it was incurred during the covered period and paid on the next regular billing date.” There’s one major exception to the paid and incurred rules: you can’t count advanced payments of mortgage interest against your forgiveness amount. It’s odd that they specified mortgage interest, rather than all advanced payments. That means that there may be a loophole for other prepayments. But remember you’re still capped at 25% of forgiveness for non-payroll expenses.   My understanding is that sole proprietors who file Schedule C do not get to count health insurance and retirement for owners as payroll costs. But what about shareholder-employees of an S-Corp? Do their benefits qualify as payroll costs?  Yes, they do. For owner-employees, essentially S-Corp shareholders, that are also employees of the company, your compensation is capped at the lessor of 8/52 of 2019 owner compensation or $15,385. This includes both cash compensation and employer retirement and health care contributions made on your behalf. Lastly, it applies across “all businesses” as well, according to the most recent regulations.   I got too much money for the PPP Loan. They calculated my loan on my gross figures from 1099s instead of line 31 on Schedule C that I actually provided with the loan application. What do I do now?  You can pay back any excess amount you received at any time. Remember, PPP is actually considered a loan first, despite all of the emphasis being on the forgiveness aspect of it. That being said, they are still figuring out all of the forgiveness rules. So, you may want to hold off until we have a better understanding of what those rules might be before you give back the money.  There is also an exception here for partners in a partnership and seasonal employers who discovered they should have gotten more money  than they were granted. Because of the lack of guidance, they are allowed loan increases based on this May 19th IFR.    I’ve heard there are different time periods that we can pull the Full-Time Equivalency (FTE) calculation from. Can you explain the different breakdowns?   Yes. There are several different periods you must look at. The Sample PPP Loan Application, Schedule A worksheet, may be helpful here.  The first periods are the look-back periods:    Then you have to look at the covered periods, of which you have to two to choose from:    Lastly, you’ll look at the safe harbor periods:    Remember that this is for each employee per week. This process will get tedious if you have a lot of employees. It will probably be tedious even if you have just a few employees. Do I need to count employees who quit voluntarily in my FTE calculation? The newest IFR explicitly answers this question:  “When an employee of the borrower is fired for cause, voluntarily resigns or voluntarily requests a reduced schedule during the covered people or the alternative payroll covered period, the borrower may count such an employee at the same full-time equivalency level before the FTE reduction event when calculating the FTE reduction penalty.” There is also no reduction for those employees that you try to rehire but choose not to come back. A couple of caveats here: you have to make a written offer to the employee. Additionally, you have to inform the state unemployment department of that employee’s rejection within 30 days.  Additional guidance is coming on this. But it seems super awkward either way.  Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EDILs) I’ve heard the SBA has changed the rules regarding the maximum loan amount from 2 million to $150,000.  Is that true?  I’ve definitely heard the reports about the reduction, but I didn’t mention this in my latest piece because I’ve been unable to verify it from the SBA. They still have $2M on their website.  What is the difference between the advance and the loan?  The EDIL advance was given to most applicants who were able to apply for the loan and requested the advance. This amount does not have to be paid back, although it will be counted against any loan forgiveness you receive under PPP.  Remember, you don’t have to take the loan if you no longer need the funds. If you do take an EDIL, you must pay it back over the next 30 years at a 3.75% interest rate (or 2.75% if you’re a non-profit organization). Payments begin 12 months after you sign your promissory note.  My EDIL was denied because of unsatisfactory credit history. What do I do now?  You have the right to request reconsideration of the SBA’s decision. You should have received a formal letter of denial from the SBA. The letter must be in writing and either mailed, faxed or emailed to the SBA. You also need to provide “significant information that will overcome the decline/withdrawal reason.” If I were in your shoes, I would provide something that shows how your recent credit history is good and more reflective of your situation than the past.  Also find out if your state offers additional resources. Check out other resources here. Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA)   Any more clarity from states since your article on April 19th?  Not really. Even though most states have their PUA programs up and running, they have been silent on how PUA will interact with PPP. Even states with large populations like CA, NY or IL don’t even mention PPP on their FAQ sights. In addition, most of the applications themselves only ask for income from 2019.  However, when you certify for benefits during unemployment, many states will ask if you’ve attempted to work or made any money. For example, CA asks:    The state also asks for other types of income you may have received. It makes sense to me that you would list your owner’s compensation paid through PPP proceeds, but you probably would not count money paid for business expenses.    I’m making more money on unemployment than I would with a PPP Loan, so I don’t want it. I heard I only had until May 18th to give it back. What can I do now?   The May 18th deadline was the Safe Harbor deadline for companies that were unsure if they could meet the “economic uncertainty” certification. That allowed those companies to give the loan back without questions and still qualify for the Employee Retention Credit, which was disallowed if you had taken a PPP Loan.   The SBA announced that companies with loans less than $2M will be deemed to have made the necessity certification in good faith. So, a lot of you reading this no longer need to worry about having to justify the loan for that reason.  Again, you can pay back your loan when you see fit. You are not required to hold it for a certain period of time or apply for forgiveness. If you no longer want the loan, simply contact your lender on ways to repay it. That being said, the forgiveness rules are changing rapidly, so you may want a complete understanding of the rules before you give the money back.   I need to cancel this unemployment so do you have any suggestions that can help me accomplish this task? You’ll need to check your state rules for cancelling (Try googling “your state” and “PUA”). In Illinois, you need to:     If I do not plan to apply for forgiveness, and will be paying my loan back at 1% over 2 years, can I just spend all the money on rent (even if it takes 6 months), and then legitimately claim UI for myself for the time when my business was mandated to be closed by the state? If you're not applying for forgiveness, you don't have to abide by the eight-week time frame and can spend the funds on any of the allowable expenses including payroll, business mortgage interest payments, business rent or lease payments, and business utility payments. If you're not spending it on payroll, it also makes sense that you wouldn't have to certify that you are receiving money from the business when you check in under the PUA. Also remember, your unemployment is taxable income to you.    I hope this was helpful. One last common question I get is for hourly or one-off planning for these programs. I do not provide that type of planning but plenty of my colleagues in the XY Planning Network, the National Association of Personal Financial Advisors (NAPFA) and the Garret Planning Network do. You can also try finding a CPA at the AICPA website. Keep in mind, there are still a lot of changes in the works including two bills being crafted in the House and Senate. We aren’t done here by a long shot. I’ll keep you up to date as things go on. Full coverage and live updates on the CoronavirusThe coronavirus crisis has triggered an historical drop in the number of state pensions paid out in Spain in May, in part because of two months of high mortality caused by coronavirus. Some parts of Spain have entered the so-called "Phase One" transition from its coronavirus lockdown, ... [+] allowing many shops to reopen as well as restaurants who serve customers outdoors Some 9,754,137 contributory pensions were paid out in May, 38,508 fewer benefits than were paid out in April. The fall has triggered an unprecedented drop in Spain’s monthly pension bill. In May, it fell by 0.3% to 9.8 billion euros, according to Spain’s Ministry of Social Security. Contributions have fallen for the past three months, while registrations have also fallen. The consecutive three month fall is the first on record, El Pais reports. The winter months and flu season also causes a slight fall in pension contributions, according to El Pais, but this month’s fall of 38,500 is unprecedented. Spain has one of Europe’s oldest populations, with 17% of the population aged 65 and over, according to government figures. The fall in payouts is not only caused by COVID mortality, but because Social Security offices were closed as Spain declared a state of emergency in March.  This meant that there were fewer registrations to request pensions, although deadlines were suspended to compensate for the closures. Spain, which is now gradually easing its lockdown, was one of the countries worst hit by coronavirus. Nearly 27,000 people have died, while the crisis was particularly severe in care homes.

The top-rated American chess player and No. 2 player in the world wanted to dispose of India’s Vidit Gujrathi as quickly as possible. He had to go to the bathroom. Caruana was unable to take a momentary pause from the game, utilize the restroom and then return to action because he had to be in front of his computer at all times as per the anti-cheating rules of the FIDE Chess.com Online Nations Cup, which also included an arbiter and proctor assigned to monitor each player and multiple cameras showing every angle, including screens, at all times. During in-person events, participants are able to walk around, use the restroom or compose themselves. “I think cheating is an enormous problem for online chess,” Caruana says. “In online chess, if a player is not on camera, if they’re not being monitored in any way and there’s a lot of money on the line, there are players who are tempted to cheat. For very large tournaments, I don’t know if there’s a solution for it because you can’t have 1,000 people on camera. I’m sure there’s a solution to the problem, but chess organizations who do online events will have to find it.” Online chess—particularly faster games including blitz and speed chess—is seeing a rapid growth in interest and participation, particularly with most people confined to their homes as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. Chess.com had 1.5 million new subscribers in April, compared with 670,000 in January; the site also estimates five years of growth over three months. Daily registration numbers at Chess24.com have tripled in many countries since the beginning of the pandemic while the number of games played daily on average has doubled compared with this time last year. The International Chess Federation (FIDE) launched “Checkmate Coronavirus” on May 18—the biggest online chess marathon ever, with an estimated 1.5 million games to be played across more than 2,000 tournaments in 720 hours of nonstop action until June 16. World No. 1 Magnus Carlsen, who defended his title against Caruana at the 2018 World Chess Championship in London, even launched his own online chess tour—the Magnus Carlsen Chess Tour—with a combined $1 million in total purse making it the richest in online chess. “Online chess was sort of making a resurgence in a way,” Caruana says. “A number of websites and creative events were coming up. We had already seen that happening, but because of the world situation, it’s now a necessity—it’s really the only way we can play chess. At some point, things will normalize, and we’ll go back to a balance of over-the-board events and online events.  “It’s nice to see chess websites and clubs are taking the initiative creating events for players when we’d normally have nothing to do in a time like this. It’s nice to see new types of events, so we’re seeing some creative ways in making new tournaments.” One of those creative tournaments is Clutch Chess, created by grandmaster and chess commentator Maurice Ashley and hosted by St. Louis Chess Club. The $100,000 event, which features the top four American players, including Caruana, takes place May 26-29.  In traditional chess tournaments, games are played in a best-of-12 format, with one point awarded per win and a half-point per draw. In order to build suspense, Ashley devised a format where Games 1-4 are scored traditionally, Games 5 and 6 are worth two points per win (one point per draw) and Games 7-10 go back to traditional scoring, with the match culminating with three-point contests in Games 11 and 12.  Not only are the “Clutch Games” worth more points, but they have accompanying monetary values attached to them as well—Games 5 and 6 are worth an extra $2,000 while Games 11 and 12 are $3,000 each. If any of those games end in a draw, the money carries over to the next game, so the winner can potentially take home even more money.

This is what I hope this scoring will do.” Caruana, who was intrigued by the modified scoring system, says he isn’t going into the event with a different game plan or mind-set than for a traditional tournament, but that may change as the tournament progresses. “It really puts a lot of pressure on particular games which makes it similar to high-stakes events,” he says, adding “It does give a chance for a player trailing to make a comeback but puts pressure on you if you have a lead because it might evaporate in one game, for example.” Ashley saw an opportunity to launch this innovative event with the world and live sports on pause as a result of the coronavirus. He said he sees this time as a massive opportunity for chess to not only keep its players and die-hard audience entertained but also to capture the attention of casual viewers who might normally be in an office during the day or preoccupied with other sporting events.

LeBron (James) can’t play against Steph Curry or the Lakers can’t play against the Bucks with everybody in their living room. In chess, the best of the best can play each other without missing a beat. “I think chess right now realizes this moment is huge. The top players see this as an opportunity. Even if we go back to live chess tournaments, now is an opportunity to grab an audience you could never even dream of having before. That’s an opportunity for chess, and they’re taking advantage of it.” While Carlsen is the face of his new online chess tour, the Norwegian has ventured into the online realm in the past, albeit under an alias.  DrDrunkenstein has wreaked havoc across the online chess community for years—popping into tournaments and soaring to the top of the scoreboard. Carlsen has also used DannytheDonkey to win tournaments; in December 2017, he won Lichess.org’s Titled Bullet Arena, an exclusive tournament for master-level players featuring one-minute games, and donated the prize money back to the website. DrDrunkenstein lived up to his name in a Lichess.org tournament the following month, with Carlsen streaming his matches on Twitch while drinking Coronas and bantering in Norweigian with friends. Nakamura has also embraced the online movement. The five-time United States Chess Champion is the top-rated blitz chess player and is the most-followed chess channel on Twitch, boasting more than 235,000 followers. He was named the top-ranked English language streamer on Twitch on May 17. Caruana had a momentary foray into Twitch and online streaming at the behest of Chess.com in May 2018; his “Chess.com Evening Blitz Session!” garnered 21,892 views. “I did a few hours of streaming, but it wasn’t entirely my thing, and it quickly got dropped because I was preparing for the World Chess Championship that year,” he says. “I never really got back into it. I do enjoy watching these events when I’m not playing them. It’s nice to be able to watch chess from the comfort of your own home; especially if it’s rapid or blitz chess, it’s very entertaining.  “I appreciate the community and events, but personally I don’t really take much to streaming. I can’t say for sure I won’t pick it up at some point, but I don’t have much of an inclination at the moment.” Ashley, on the other hand, is slowly succumbing to streaming after being encouraged to join for years. He remains steadfast with the type of content he wants to publish while seeing the benefit of providing fans and chess aficionados with access to the content and accessibility of a grandmaster. “Chess had this tradition of players being boring introverts with no personalities—typical stereotypes—but now with things like Twitch streams, you see someone like Hikaru trash-talking while he’s playing, and Magnus as the No. 1 egghead in the world is actually good-looking, funny, witty,” Ashley says. “It’s personal access (fans have) never had before. The mere fact you feel like you’re in his living room, hearing him talk and watching him play, that’s never happened before. It really is a golden age of access for fans, who can really participate in that whole process and have fun with a game they love. “But I’m not sure all of this is a good thing. That’s why I’ve shied away from it for so long. How much access am I going to give people in my private space? I’m going to control it. I want to show people real chess and give lessons, not so much play and banter but more educational entertainment. We’ll see if it works.” While the future of the sport will undoubtedly revert back to over-the-board in-person tournaments played around the world from St. Louis to Moscow, online chess may serve as a nice complement, not only for world-class players but especially for amateurs and rising stars who can make a name for themselves no matter where in the world they are, all while being in the comfort of their own home. Until then, grandmasters and novices alike have an endless list of online tournaments, Twitch channels, apps and streaming services to get their fix of the never-ending battle between black and white. “This is going to continue to some degree,” Ashley says. “How much is the question. The players themselves are going to want a part of that lifestyle—to travel and go to all these great places. I think the landscape has definitely changed, but if Magnus can be sitting somewhere in Oslo and we can have him do a Clutch Chess match against Nakamura for $250,000, no one is going to say ‘no’ to that. It’s going to be where the money is.  “I think the landscape has definitely changed much like the world has changed. The future will tell us exactly what that blend will be of online versus live.” Full coverage and live updates on the Coronavirus
